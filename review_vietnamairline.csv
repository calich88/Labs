1,Patrick F,1,"I am highly unhappy with this airline! The Website is a big mess. I wanted to book extra sportluggage (which I thought should be no problem). I could not find any terms regarding the extra price and neither could book it online. Furthermore I tried to get someone on the phone for 3 days. The only person I got could not speak proper the language and could not help me. She just spoke random sentences which made no sense at all. <br><br>Then I have send an E-Mail and again no answer, which could help. The only reply on my mail was a link to the webpage, wher again I could not find any information.<br><br>Never again! If I could I would cancel the whole holiday because I wanted to go kitesurfing with my own gear."
1,Inda H,2,Called 7 times and no answer nor voice message. Said on policy not require visa but end up I have to pay for extra visa just for transit. Scam
1,Sam B,1,"They hold on to your your cash while refuse to refund in the form of vouchers for immediate use. <br><br>We got a confirmation of the refund of around $6.2K AUD for our cancellation on the 2nd October. After more than one month wait, we contacted VietnamAirlines only to be confirmed that the refund did not come through due to issues with their Mastercards portal, but we used American Express card for the purchase. Without any explaination for the such nonsense reason for the  delay of the refunds, Vietnamairlines then confirmed they would do manual refund and we have to wait another 10 -15 days. After waiting for many more days , with 8 international calls and 9 emails back and forth - some of which were completely ignored until international calls were made to enquire of this situation-, we still yet to see any refunds and only got back a generic promise ""we will get back to you"" !"
1,Therese K,4,"Overall 4 flights. 3 were fine, the all seemed to leave late but always arrived on time. The fourth one, the entertainment in rows 24-28 on the right side didn't work at all for anyone on the Melbourne flight. <br><br>It took 3 hours for a staffer to finally offer to move seats and have us prove that the screens still weren't working  and by then no one could be bothered since it was midnight and an overnight flight. it was very annoying. Please fix it!!. And if you are flying from Melbourne and want inflight entertainment make sure not to pick those seats.<br><br>The food was fine, the flight entertainment was fine when it worked, seats are narrow but good leg room. The optional  bubble tea was gross, I don't recommend.<br><br>I'm not going to give a bad rating based on that one flight but I imagine if it had been a day time or a longer flight I would have been fuming."
1,An K,1,"Summary, please avoid buying Vietnam Airlines if you have not done so.<br>I will rate minus stars if there is such an option.<br><br>We paid for 6 persons to fly end Now 2023 sometime in June 2023.<br><br>Our confirmed flights were then changed unilaterally by VA and no information was provided to us. The flights that were changed by VA could never have happened as the flight timings overlap (SG to HCM 2205 and HCM to Hanoi 2200). I wrote in on 19 August and was directed to online support on 24 August. This is where the nightmare service began.<br><br>We have to accept a change in dates of our flights. This cut short our original holiday and we have to suffer some travel costs (accomodation, travel insurance) that are non-refundable.<br><br>After almost 2.5 months of writing emails and waiting in good faith, VA will not compensate us to make good the unnecessary costs. Other than the online support with poor service attitude, no manager has contacted me.<br><br>This episode has caused caused unnecessary stress to my family, especially my parents and children who are looking foward to their year end holiday."
2,Lisa,1,Most terrible experience with an agency ever! Delayed flight from Ho Chi Minh caused it that we wouldn't make our transfer in Paris (notification only 2 days before). They made it our problem instead of theirs and the alternative options were terrible. Never again.
2,Lion K,1,"As with this new age, companies will offer a refund but even with medical evidence they will deny it to you. Especially this company that will offer cheap flights but take you hostage with extra fees and luggage"
2,Coopper29,5,"This was a great way to get to Hanoi nonstop. Most other airlines stop over and one has to change planes, the business class service was as good as any other top airline, and cost wise was 40% less than most airlines."
2,Maps41495746526,2,"It is the backend planning and operations of vietnam airlines that is horrible. First, our return flight timing back to singapore was pushed back by  20 mins. We didnt complain as it was a small shift . However, just a few days later, the flight timing got pushed back by a further 3 hours. It went from 10 50am to 7 45 am and considering that earlier flights were cheaper, they didn't even bother to at least offer a small discount. Moreover, this happened on short notice- 1 week before our trip. Secondly, the terminal stated on our ticket was stated as terminal 4 at changi airport. But vietnam airlines was actually at terminal 3. There was not a word of the change. Fortunately, my partner had the foresight to double check the terminals on changi airport's website before we departed for the airport . Extremely disappointed, will not be flying on vietnam airlines again"
2,Fearless55982077045,1,"Booked my direct flights to China (Hanoi to Chengdu) back in September directly with Vietnam Airline. Received last minute flight cancellation notice due to operational with no reschedule detail listed on email. Email them right back to check on possibilities on rescheduling with no response, had to make international call to confirm rescheduling is not possible as entire route was canceled and there are no other direct flight options available. Went through their refund process online via after sales, system error message keeps pops up to prevent me submit request. Try to avoid this airline if possible, services is not great with delay and cancellation rate above 67%..wished I have checked this before I book. Never thought of such short flight will cause all these inconveniences."
3,evans57,1,"Clear discrimination here, we had a 12k carry on allowance, we have hand luggage only which weighs less than 10 kg,  arbitrarily reduced at check in to 7kg so had to check everything in.. arrive at gate to see this. So fine if you are Vietnamese but if you are western then second class. It was not a cheap flight. Very disappointed. Will not retiurn."
3,Soko37,3,"Flight delayed almost 1 hour, slow boarding due to big plane and poor refreshment on  board. Sweat bakery with pieces of salami was not good choice and no beer."
3,Paul S,4,"Mainly good, staff on check in and on the plane really helpfully, food good, If you suspect you may need to change flight get the app, domestic flights changed times by two hours but I was informed in advance so no problem for me."
3,Salar A,1,"I wanted to change my flight from HCM to Saigon, to Can Tho to Saigon, for the same day. At first, the price over the phone to change flights was quoted as AUD120, Then via email confirmation immediately after it increased to $162. Then when I queried why I should do this when it is the same price just to book the new flight I wanted they emailed again saying it is actually $262 to change it, with the other option being that I pay a fee, yes you read correctly, I pay a $30 fee to cancel the HCM to Saigon flight and then I can just book and pay for another separate flight on my own. LOL"
3,Gary H,2,"Recently flew business class with Vietnam Airlines from Sydney to Frankfurt and back, a total of four flights, also paid for my sister’s economy flights so paid approximately $10,000 AUD in total. Not something I would normally do, but I was excited at splashing out on business class flights.  I purchased the tickets many months in advance and selected window seats on all legs. <br><br>On the flight from Sydney to Hanoi, the entertainment system was broken, but as the flight wasn’t full, I could move one seat back to a seat with working entertainment so not a big deal. The rest of the flight to Frankfurt was pretty good. <br><br>When I checked in at Frankfurt on my way home, I was advised that my seat had a faulty entertainment system and that I would be given an iPad. Having paid a signifiant sum of money for the flight, I advised that I wasn’t happy with that arrangement but was told that as the flight was full, there was no option to be reallocated to another seat. I reluctantly accepted and they issued my boarding passes at which point I was advised that the Ho Chi Minh to Sydney leg was a window seat I stated that the Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh should also be a window seat but I was told that ‘strangely’ the system did not have a seat allocated to me and this was the only option available to me.<br><br>I wasn’t satisfied with that and found my print out of my booking from months before which clearly showed my seat selection being a window seat. I spoke to the checkin manager who explained to me that my seat had been given to someone else as perhaps they were travelling as a pair or were ‘more important’ than me his words, not mine. Worth nothing was that I had checked in 3 hours before the flight left and there were still people behind me checking in. And the window seat they gave to someone else was a single seat, and the internal seat I was given was a twin. What I think happened was that the customer originally assigned to my seat had been advised their seat had no working entertainment system, complained, and had been reallocated to my seat leaving me as the customer with no working entertainment. <br><br>When I boarded I was given the iPad which staff had assured me had all the same movies etc on it as the in flight entertainment system. but it didn’t. It only had 10 English speaking films on it, 2 of which were boxing films, and one a kids movie. So I sat on an 11 hour flight from Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh with the absolute worst selection of ‘straight to DVD’ movies I’ve ever seen on a flight. <br><br>After paying a premium price and receiving a very inferior product, I figured I was liable for some for of compensation a future upgrade, a partial refund or some bonus miles perhaps I wrote to the airline and their customer service team first advised they had no record of this incident. Then in the second email exchange miraculously remembered the incident and stated that I had told them at checkin I was ok with the situation, which was an absolute lie. Ultimately they refused to acknowledge or compensate me at all for the experience. <br><br>I’ve been astounded by the lack of accountability and the absolute lack of customer service from this airline. I will never fly with this them again and vowed to warn others of the substandard experience.<br><br>There is no reason I would ever recommend Vietnam Airlines to anyone. They may be slightly cheaper than other airlines, but the service and reliability is atrocious.To people thinking of booking with them: I would advise you go with anyone else. The product you get is not inline with what they are selling you."
4,James B,2,No response from customer services email addresses to multiple emails despite being unable to modify flights online and being referred to the email address for support. Vietnam Airlines customer service is on par with low cost carriers yet prices the same as full service ones. How can they have a 4 star rating?
4,JnVSydney,5,"From checkin to baggage claim, it was a no fuss operation, the staff were friendly and helpful, we had exit row seats, which really helps with comfort, all in all it was what we expected with no surprises."
4,Amy L,1,"They don't respond to emails, calls to the help line say they're too busy and hang up on you, the aus branch is very rude and just direct me back to the help line and emails that don't respond"
4,Leanne W,1,"We are travelling for our honeymoon,<br>From after we booked flights have been changed over 10 times. We have tried calling &amp; emailing to change 1 of the flights can’t get through on the phone you just sit on hold for hours. No reply to emails our travel agent has also tried and she gets no where either.<br>We get to the airport today to start our trip. Staff are rude and far from friendly, 1 even talked over our shoulders to other customers.<br>We asked them to help change 1 of our flight they were like bad luck just keep ringing yourself.<br><br>Hopefully their service improves from here.<br>But after reading reviews I’m not holding my breath."
4,Soko37,4,"Check in smooth as being early, flight was delayed one hour so plenty of time for podcasting. Organized boarding, easy flight and reaching Hanoi in two hours. After flying many flights with Vietnam Airlines, I got decent food, finally ."
5,Sush,1,"Stupidest airlines with slow transfer service. They don't give you visa for onwards flight, no clear instructions and then it's on you to wait at the transfer desk at the international airport to get it yourself. The wait time, can be any thing."
5,Gary M,1,"I can honestly day say the worst airline I have ever travelled with and I have used Ryanair in the past. We pre- ordered vegetarian meals for the flight , they didn't have it, kept offering us chicken, the entertainment screen was broken , so could not use for the entire 13 hour flight, the stewardess offered to move my wife to an aisle seat in a different part of the plane , so we would be apart for the whole journey.  We didn't have anything to eat for 13 hours except for some dry crackers and a very dry bread roll. The drinks service was incredibly mean, the cabin crew were surley and unattentive, I will never fly with this airline ever again.  One more thing the chap in the next seat to me who was not vegetarian,  said his inflight meal was the worst food he had ever experienced.  Be warned, take your own food on board if you fly with them."
5,MizuhoK,4,We took round trip from Hanoi to Hue. They were short flights and services were limited as no entertainment or only one bottle of water was given. The flight departed on time. Efficient check at AP in although online check in didn’t work for us.
5,Alana M,1,"DONT FLY WITH VIETNAM AIRLINES <br>I travelled with Vietnam airlines SYD-CDG. They added in an additional stop  over in Vietnam, adding hours to the trip (but wait...there's more).<br>When we finally got to Paris, they had lost my luggage. It took them days to locate the luggage. Once they advised that they had found it, they said they would bring it to my hotel in Spain. It never turned up.<br>I then called the airline and after being transferred to different departments  numerous times, they admitted that they had lost my luggage AGAIN.<br>After hours and hours on the phone, I found out my luggage had been passed by Vietnam airlines to 2 other airlines (Air France and Ibera) but was told that Vietnam airlines was still responsible for the luggage and was overseeing it.<br>When trying to locate the luggage I was told by the other airlines that it wasn't their responsibility and to contact Vietnam airlines, they in turn blamed the other airlines.<br>I was finally told by a lovely person at Ibera airlines that Vietnam airlines had closed my case (I still hadn't received my luggage). She also advised that my luggage was in Lugo (she said she should be telling me this, but felt sorry for me) and  I was told ""under no circumstances that I should go to the airport and try and claim my luggage, as I didn't have any email/ proof that the luggage was there"".<br>As I had been without luggage for over a week and a half, against her advice, I then drove to the airport (hours away from where I was staying), lied and said I was told to come and pick it up, they then handed my my luggage.<br><br>It is months later after numerous emails and phone calls back and for with Vietnam airlines, the compensation I have been offered it $80 USD for; lost luggage, petrol costs to try and go and claim my luggage, hours and hours lost on my holiday on the phone to the airline/s.<br>BUT there is more...they cant give me the money because I can not produce the first luggage tag that was on my bag....the worst airline I have ever flown with."
5,Twobears,1,"Seat doesn’t recline. Inflight meal were tasteless, no inflight entertaining. Have to manually transfer between international and domestic flights. Onboard crew has low level of understanding requests and doesn’t speak much English. Staff at check in counters = rude and ruder only. <br>Seeing how the airline only response to positive comments and ignore negative ones on this site, you can get a general feel of this airline. Do not use if possible."
6,Alan N,4,"We have just returned from a visit to Vietnam, flying Vietnam Airlines.  We had never flown with them before but they offered a direct flight whereas most other airlines required a stopover and were very much longer.  I was very pleasantly surprised with their business class.  I did find I was unable to lie flat because the space where the feet go tapers to a point and I have very large feet, but I could still get a good sleep.  <br>The in flight entertainment was very limited for English speaking passengers but it is an Asian airline catering mainly for Asian passengers.<br>Check-in ground staff were efficient. The cabin crew were polite and obliging. Both flights, there and back,  left and arrived on time. Our baggage was waiting for us at the destination.  Food on board was tasty.  <br>As one who far prefers getting of an aircraft at destination than getting on for the start of the journey, it was a comfortable experience."
6,Soko37,3,"Quick check in very early in the morning, little people at immigrations, getting on board in priority boarding. Food bit better than last time to Bangkok, flight on time"
6,Oli K,5,We had a mix up with a visa last minute on our end and the airline were very understanding and helped us arrange alternative travel with no extra cost (you would never find this with budget European airlines like I’m used to) The customer service is excellent as well as the on board experience. Would absolutely recommend!
6,Gagan S,1,"First time travelled with Vietnamese airline and worst experience ever. Would never recommend it to anyone from my circle. They lost my luggage and till now there is no clue about it’s location or anything. It’s been 1 weel already. It’s my wedding in 2days and my all important and expensive stuff is in my suitcase. Now because of them i am running all around to buy everything again. No one from this airline is helping to find my suitcase. Now if they are not able to give my suitcase my tomorrow, i would really not need it after that it’s already too late from their side. No customer service at all. Till now no one has informed me anything about my luggage and even now i don’t even think that they are even trying to helping out. If anyone wants to travel with this airline i would recommend to keep your all luggage with you rather than trusting them and giving it as a checkin bag."
6,Derek N,1,"Please do NOT purchase Vietnam airline before read this. If you purchase online, you are out of luck because there will be no support and you cannot change your flight or modify it because there is pricing error that will stop you from changing. I tried to chat, call and email every single day for weeks, and they dont care to respond. They never bother to fix anything. On-flight service is not friendly. So if you still decide to go with Vietnam airline, go to an agent and buy it for higher price, and even online is not cheap. This airline is a nightmare. So i would not recommend it."
7,ExVotoFatum,5,"Flight was cancelled at Gate and we had to wait 24 hours. VNM airlines arranged hotel accommodation ( quite far from airport) , transport , food.<br>So far OK.<br>I sent two emails to VNM Airlines office in Frankfurt City and Airport asking compensation according EU Law.<br>I never got an answer. What a shame, I am also Gold member. <br>I have no chance and will have to go the legal court procedure."
7,Odyssey37174177515,1,"Worst flight home, my assigned seating was broken air hostess said they will try and find me a new seat, never came back to me. 4 toilets were unusable no water in 3x of the toilets, toilets has poo and pee all over the toilet seats and toilet paper. It stunk so bad!  <br><br>In flight entertainment was not working all flight."
7,extravelagent,4,"Not sure why I was hesitant to fly Vietnam Air; after all they are part of Skyteam but I was pleasantly surprised each time. I had to fly them on 3 occasions: HAN SGN, SGN DAD, and DAD SGN. All the flights were pleasant, usually got a drink and maybe a snack. The seats were fine (even flew a 787 from HAN SGN!) and usually on time. The in flight staff were nice, the check in staff were fine however they scared me once by saying because I didn't add my middle name to the ticket (like my passport) I could be stopped by security and denied boarding (it was fine). As is with SE Asia even though there are boarding zones, it's never respected by the passengers. Just know that I think on all occasions, we needed to get on a bus to get to our plane and to get bussed back to the terminal. It down poured once so we got fairly soaked coming down the stairs. The cool thing is that when you board, they open all 3 doors of the plane (maybe it was just for the 787, I can't really recall) but that's a great way to get everyone on board FAST.<br>Overall, I would definitely fly them again and even use them internationally. <br>My miles dropped in within days to my Delta account. Thumbs up for Vietnam Airlines"
7,Radhika P,2,"I am very surprised to hear that Vietnam Airlines wont change my daughter's name on our family Lotus Miles account (which leaves out her middle name). My responses to emails have been to avoid the subject.  My daughter is 15 years old, travelling tomorrow on second leg of her VA ticket, and I cannot get ANY SOLUTION from Lotus Miles or Vietnam Airlines via phone or email. All I would like is her miles, seat allocation and their acknowledgement that her identity is not different to her travel and birth documents - which they said it is and therefore she cannot get miles? We are expats living in Hanoi for a year, using Vietnam Airlines every 2 months, about to book more flights.  Can someone please assist us? I am not sure what else to do but post here. Last month we flew VA to Cambodia - we booked direct, our friends booked same flight through Expedia. VA sent an anonymous text that there flight was cancelled and they had been moved to another later flight.  We knew it wasn't cancelled, the return leg was a Cambodia Air flight that was codeshare. When we called and pointed out that half of us were still on the cancelled flight they fixed it immediately and said it was a mistake to offload our friends (computer error). The airline is efficient, why is customer service working against the interests of the customer? I have emailed for 6 weeks regarding my daughter travel, which is tomorrow! Very disappointing from an International Airline.  My mother is flying Biz Class in December, it will be interesting to see if she gets more respect?"
7,Simon Hoang,4,"Vietnam Airlines is a pretty genuine and good airlines. The service is good, the legroom is good, everything is not bad. The seats are nice but nothing special for a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Over all, it's good but theirs way better opinion."
8,Englong T,1,"The poor airline ever, i will never choose to flight with this airline again. Broke my luggage wheel and had no responsible, poor services and food even the facilities for business so old. <br>No recommend at all ( always delay and late)"
8,Kris V,1,"You get what you pay for, and even then it's below par at best. On a return trip to France consisting of 4 Vietnam Airlines flights, all planes were disgustingly dirty, cabin crew were notedly lazy and lacking in customer etiquette, and 3 out of 4 planes were delayed for over 2 hours each. Vietnamese customs are far from the most friendly or helpful people I've encountered which is a shame because locals in Saigon and Hanoi are lovely. Don't be a scrooge and pay the extra for some quality."
8,Soko37,3,"Easy check as we were earlier, very organised boarding according zones. The flight short , after few minutes from take off, we started to land. Few turbulences"
8,Alexandra Â,1,"Vietnam Airlines changed our flight from Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc for 1 hour early without any advise. We only saw the change when we were doing the online check-in. We called the line 1900 1100 and the only option was to change the flight to the next day. After we asked to wait a few minutes on the line, the lady put the call on hold and hang up the phone. So, this means that we would lost our hotel reservation and tour (that were already paid) in Phu Quoc. We had to spend more 200$ on another flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh to be able to catch the flight that Vietnam Airlines changed without any advise. Terrible service, we don’t recommend this company."
8,João L,1,"Vietnam Airlines changed our flight from Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc for 1 hour early without any advise. We only saw the change when we were doing the online check-in. We called the line 1900 1100 and the only options was to change the flight to the next day. After we asked to wait a few minutes on the line the lady put the call on hold and hang up the phone. We called again and the solution was the same, change the flight to the next day. So we had to spend more 200$ on another flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh to be able to catch the flight that Vietnam Airlines changed without any advise. Terrible service, we don’t recommend this company."
9,Davin,1,We booked a round trip from Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc months before our journey. We had everything planned for the trip but had to rearrange several times because they keep on rescheduling the flight. Our first flight was rescheduled 5 hours later and operated by Pacific Airlines instead. Our second flight was also rescheduled 4 hours later and even got delayed by 2 hours.
9,Peter C,1,Do not fly with Vietnam Airlines. I booked online on their website. When I arrived to catch my flight I was told I needed a Visa for stopping in Vietnam even though I was only in transit. This was not mentioned when I booked the flight and was not on any of my ticketing or correspondence. There were 5 people travelling London to Sydney on my flight who needed Visas. Apparently there is a similar number on every one of these flights.<br>We were told we could get urgent Visas at a cost of US$275! We googled Vietnam Visas and 3 of the 5 of us went to scam sites (apparently there are several and this happens to airline customers all the time). We were unable to catch out flight. The replacement flights cost several thousand extra dollars as well as causing stress and anxiety of going through this process.<br>Vietnam Airlines is well aware of this situation and does not advise customers that a Visa may be needed (until they try and board a plane) and does not prove any advice on how to get authorised Visas at the gate.
9,trish f,2,"After an awful experience with Vietnam Air in 2016 we decided to try them again. We do enjoy flying fully serviced Airlines. We'll what do you know we spent a small fortune to get a flight, we were not even put onto A Vietnam Airlines plane they put is on pacific Airlines in which they expected us to pay for water, tea or coffee which was included in the price we paid for on our ticket. Never again 2nd chance done and dusted"
9,Linna S,1,"I had a flight from phụ quốc to Saigon with a different airline that changed just a day before the flight reservation to a later time which did not work with my schedule so I rebooked with Vietnam Airlines in a haste. I booked the wrong departure location, mistakenly choosing Saigon to phụ quốc. It had only been a few hours since I booked the ticket but the associate at the Vietnam Airlines ticket counter refused to help me. I wanted to call the customer service number myself but my phone couldn’t make calls so I asked if I could borrow one but she just turned me away. Seeing as it was an honest mistake and the reservation was booked within 24 hours, they should’ve been more accomodating especially since I was asking for a change of flight and not a refund."
9,James,5,I was impressed with the service on my flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City. I accidentally left a bag at the gate. One of the flight attendants helped me file a missing luggage claim. They also fly Airbus planes in their fleet. United could learn a few things about Vietnamese customer service.
10,SJPX88648,1,"I didn’t actually get to travel with VN Airlines: My review concerns its absolutely appalling customer service between my original booking of a domestic flight and my ultimate cancellation. First, VN canceled my outbound flight (HAN-DAD) and rebooked me on an early-morning flight the same day. It took numerous calls and - unbelievably - multiple email messages in English before I could rebook at a satisfactory departure time. Annoying and inconvenient, but that’s hardly the worst. <br><br>After discovering a serious error in my work visa, I had to turn over my US Passport to request a correction. When I tried to contact VN by phone to get clarification about allowable forms of ID, they referred me to the VN website, which has ambiguous language and which its employees apparently don’t even understand. As with my rebooking experience, VN required me to send multiple emails with my ID documents and then call back - just to verify that online support had received my query. Twice, I received nothing. I phoned back multiple times, only to be told either that I should resend my email or that I had to read the email that VN had sent (but that I never received). <br><br>As departure time got closer, I called again. Unbelievably, the agent said I should “read the email.” And NO: She could not simply tell me what the email said. At least she managed to resend the elusive email, but the message just repeated the confusing info on the website and said I should go to the “Embassy.” Ridiculous and useless. I became so anxious and frustrated that I took a Grab to the closest VN Ticket Office, where two agents were just totally confused by my simple question: Can I travel with any of these documents (or a combination of them)? Same question that I had tried asking by email and phone, multiple times. At the Ticket Office, the women at the desk kept asking the same questions that I had answered multiple times: What happened to your passport? Shouldn’t you get your passport from “the Embassy”? They kept saying I should read the website, which they clearly could not interpret themselves. “Will you let me fly tomorrow or not?” Simple question, right? Nope, apparently too difficult a question. <br><br>Finally, after one person went away with my documents and made me wait, she said “government regulation” requires a passport. I understand. Not a VN policy but a law. Why did it take DAYS to get that simple answer after asking the question multiple times online, on the phone, and via email. When I asked the agent to cancel my reservation, I said I deserved a full refund and shouldn’t have to pay the cancellation fee after the nonsense that VN’s ill-trained and inefficient customer service staff had put me through. Massive waste of my time, effort, and money (not just the cancellation fee, but also the 191,000VND that I spent on Grab rides to and from the Ticket Office). <br><br>I don’t question the airline’s enforcement of the rules, but it behaved totally incompetently in conveying that policy and utterly failed to help me understand it. I don’t understand how such a poorly run carrier can earn four stars from SkyTrax, but after my experience, I’m not curious enough to find out what it’s actually like to fly with VN. If I could assign zero stars, I would. Truly one of the most awful experiences I’ve ever had with any airline anywhere in the world."
10,Long,4,The Flight Itself Was Good and the Crew Were Very Kind the legroom was awesome but Vietnam Airlines should add inflight wifi
10,Prashanth S,3,"I booked a red eye flight, which is supposed to depart at 03:35AM. They have sent an email regarding the change, which i missed. Usually other airlines call or repeatedly send until we accept. Vietnam Airlines won't do it. Reached airport at 02:00 AM.  At the airport we got to know that out flight got cancelled and accomodated us in 07:55 AM flight. Nightmare!!!<br>They try to conpensate us by giving us a breakfast voucher, which is really not needed at that point of time!"
10,Hannah L,1,"I booked a ticket knowing that it might have to be changed or cancelled due to health condition.  Their website showed a cancellation fee of USD 50.  However, ticket was issued with a link that takes me to another site that shows USD 150 cancellation fee per leg.  I wouldn’t have booked with Vietnam Airways if I knew upfront.  I’ve been flying with them a number of times .  Terrible services,  many of the flight attendants are arrogant, asked for some water, said thank you and they walked away, no response, no water half an hour later.  They are quite pricy comparing to Vietjet or Bamboo."
10,Soko37,3,"Check in was express as coming rather early, immigration with luck when they opened new counters, enjoying some hour in airport before boarding. Boarding organised well, starting some minutes later than scheduled, getting on the bus as airport is in reconstruction. Take off delayed and heading to Bangkok, flight was not fully booked. Food onboard sucks, cheap sandwiches are extreme bottom comparing other international flights. Landing on time and being lucky again at immigration"
11,Anna P,5,Thank you Ms. Nguyen Thị Thu Ha for fast and exceptional service. <br>Ms. Nguyen helped us reserve seats for free.
11,ExVotoFatum,5,"The staff of the flight to and from Bangkok  were always very friendly. Food at flight is ok.  Check in Hanoi is excellent, in Bangkok you need more time as procedures are different They still use plastic emballage for forks etc."
11,dvbkk,1,"Surfboards, surfing kites, surfing sails: the length does not exceed 250cm Airlines sports baggage written policy states "" Since it must be packed in proper protective luggage this normally adds some volume. Checked in 201 cm length protective surfboard bag within 23 kg weight. Bangkok airport ground staff took bag without issue. Ground staff would only do this if they were directed by management to do so. Arrived to Da Nang no issues. On return Da Nang airport ground staff refused to honor same standard and would not let my VERY SAME weight and dimensions  bag go unless I paid oversize fee approx 60 USD. Then check in at HCM airport staff accepted bag without issue as the Bangkok staff did. Again they would not do this unless directed by management. Does Vietnam Airlines not think a passenger must also return to their origin airport? Da Nang ground staff claimed total dimensional length was greater than 203. cm.  It would need to be a surfboard for a toddler or a midget to meet those dimensions. This reasoning is not logical but delusional. They use this to justify extorting the passenger for extra money, perhaps the ground staff gets a bonus or commission? Looking at the high % of poor reviews I was an exception as my many years of flying them was very positive. They have to date refused to offer a refund or even a flight voucher of comparable value though they apologise for the inconvenience and lack of standards across different airports and acknowledge the above. Despite the ticket being more expensive I chose Vietnam Airlines due to this sports equipment policy. It is better to fly the cheaper Airasia and pay 25 USD for surfboard to 25KG than pay high priced Vietnam Airlines and get extorted/scammed for 60USD more. An airline that deceives and defrauds it's longstanding/any customer IMO is terrible."
11,S B,1,Vietnam airlines would have been a great experience if it wasn’t for the two unscheduled change of flights within Vietnam. This through out our travel plans and needs to be addressed. It ended with us spending 7 hours of a 8 day trip at the airport between flights. Staff at airport weren’t concerned so this must happen all of the time. Think twice before travelling on this airline.
11,JordoE,3,"I flew Melbourne to London return stopping in Ho Chi Minh City. When I arrived to Melbourne airport to depart for London I presented my transit visa (this is a requirement if you are stopping in Vietnam). Similar to the many other reviews on TripAdvisor below I was told that I would not be able to board the flight as the issuing of the visa left off one of the letters from my passport. Initially the only solution that was offered was that I would not be able to board and would need to reapply for another visa which could take a week. Thankfully one of the other staff members told me to see Flight Centre next to the check in desk to get an immediate visa, costing $500AUD. I did pay this, received the visa and was allowed to board the flight.<br>Business class was satisfactory, seats recline into a flat bed and were fairly comfortable. The section where feet go when lying down is very narrow and mine struggled to fit in the space, making sleeping difficult at times. The food was served at the beginning and end of the flight with some fruit and nuts served in between. I would advise to pack a few extra snacks if you are after sweets like biscuits, chocolate, protein bars etc during the flight. The food was OK, however, if you have specific dietary requirements tell the airline in advance. My friend (also on the same flight) is not allowed dairy and, at times, had very limited /sometimes no option for main meal.<br>On the flight returning to Melbourne the flight was delayed by three hours, leaving at midnight. For me this was not an issue as I knew I would sleep on the plane, however, if you are travelling economy/premium economy it might be a consideration if you struggle to sleep sitting up, have children etc. <br>The staff on all flights were exceptional and very attentive. Every crew member I interacted with was polite, helpful and provided great service. This would be one reason I would potentially travel with Vietnam Airlines.<br>I would recommend VA to people if they are not time sensitive (two of my four flights were delayed), were happy with basic food options and don't mind how they to get to destination.<br>If you are a business traveller,  I would not recommend this airline to you."
12,Juliette M,1,Flight there and back ran out of second choice of meal. Took ages to be served as at wrong end of plane. <br>Food low quality and was offered a meal which had obviously been dropped as the container was broken.  Asked if any vacant seats for elderly huband with medical condition  and noticed many younger flyers had three vacant seats but not offered one my advice is to go first class if affordable!  Would try to avoid using again.
12,fransie0509,5,"Our final leg of two weeks in Vietnam was highlighted by the service received by the Vietnam Airline team at their main ticketing office and then the flight itself.<br>We went to the office to purchase an upgrade to BC from PE (US$610 each) but were told we may have enough LotusMiles for a free upgrade. This was confirmed and the upgrade was made..how excited were we. The service received by one particular staff member was above and beyond; outstanding. <br>On the plane itself.well it’s Business Class isn’t it so all I’m going to say is that the team that looked after us and all the other customers were exemplary in their conduct; terrific work and thank you Vietnam Airlines, you’re the best."
12,sunilt1960,3,"We had booked on two flights Ho Chi Minh City to Halong -VN 839 &amp; <br>Hanoi to Siem Reap VN-1172 on two separate flights. <br>The Hanoi to Siem Reap flight was on time. However the VN-1172 was suddenly cancelled the day before and they rescheduled us to next flight VN-1182, 1 hr 15 min later. Vietnam Airlines has the best net work connecting Vietnam and nearby cities. The flights were good and on time. I was told that it while in Vietnam it is better to take Vietnam air as they have better connectivity and more flights"
12,Alexander,4,"Great flight, with a super friendly and helpful crew, The aircraft felt a little old and tatty but for sure fine especially for a shorter flight. Unfortunately last minute aircraft change, sure to a larger A350 instead of an A321, but had to pay extra to sit together with my family on the A321 but was not needed as the aircraft was changed."
12,Lam D,1,Today I was traveling domestic flights and booked on Vietnam Airlines and I got there 30 minutes before departure and they refused to honor my ticket because they said it was too late. That is a bunch of BS. They told me that I had to buy another ticket. I guess that is how they make extra money. I’ve arrived 30 minutes before the flight before and didn’t have any issues. It’s sad that they have to be dishonest to make money.
13,Ava Po,5,"Check-in fairly quick and friendly. Sat in an economy exit row aisle seat. You can fold out the TV to make other passengers less likely to walk into your legs. The service was great (compared to Thai Airways) with several drink/snack offerings throughout the flight, in addition to 2 meals, no extra charges. Staff were attentive and helpful. Airline staff could have improved by encouraging passengers to not have their seat reclined during meal service. International AC power socket under the seat. No WiFi available, but I didn't want it anyway. The remote control placement in the arm rest on the dreamliner planes is awful, passengers constantly knock it by accident, triggering calls for assistance and turning on overhead lights."
13,Kim B,2,Arm rears<br>We’re duct taped together.  Entertainment didn’t work.  No decent movies.  Squashed seating just terrible.  Awful landing 2 hour delay one hour sitting on tarmac in Sydney and one hour doing circles over Ho Chi Minh.
13,Pamela M,1,"First and last time with Vietnam Airlines. I have also been to many international airlines and seeing that their flight attendants are very professionally trained to every detail, I am really satisfied. The first time I chose Vietnam Airlines I liked it because they have direct flights from Vietnam to SFO and back to Seattle but it was disappointing that the flight attendants of the airline were completely untrained, I had to remind them several times every time they served food, they don't remind customers to straighten their seats while dining it's so bad when I encounter an impolite passenger he always flips the recliner even while eating and drops the whole thing pillow on me because he always pushes his body up and down like something and the flight attendant didn't remind him to straighten the chair for me to eat, this is just one detail I told and more There are other details that I cannot mention here. All other airline flight attendants remind the guests as well to check the seats are adjusted before they serve the food but VietNam Airlines they don't do that and when I remind ask the person sitting in front of me straightening the chair, they even corrected me and told me that it's not the right time..? So why do they serve food..,? It's a shame that such a large airline has untrained and inexperienced flight attendants."
13,Catherine T,2,I strongly recommend checking absolutely all information on travel documents before flying with this airline. We arrived at Melbourne airport to be told that my partner’s name had been transcribed wrongly on the visa  (second name first) and therefore we would not be allowed to board the plane. The only way out was to go to the flight travel office at the airport and purchase an emergency visa for AUS $550.00 which we had no choice but to do.  The Vietnamese system of putting second names first is confusing and obviously incorrect. This happpened to at least three other passengers on our flight so clearly someone is making a lot of money somewhere. I’m not saying it was just the airline’s fault but it is clearly something that passengers need to be aware of.
13,Leonardoheli,1,"The cabin temperature was at least 38C and stayed that way for 45 minutes until we took off.  People complained and the attendants just explained that the temperature would cool down once we were in the air.  This was a cost saving measure, but a moronic one, as the use of the AC pumps is no more than .5% of the possible fuel burn on a trip like this.  It takes a 13 year old understanding of physics to realize that.  There is almost ZERO savings of fuel by keeping the cabin sweltering and risking heat stroke for 200 passengers.  Absoultely pitiful ignorance and cheapness for a Very Expensive flight.  UTTER GARBAGE AIRLINE"
14,Vacationer774591,1,"when i got to the airport i was advised i needed a visa to pass through vietnam, they said it was all over the website but it isn't. I tried to get a last minute visa but the website was bad and it didnt work and i wasn't allowed to board, i had to buy a new flight through another company and lost all my money on this flight. The VA staff were unhelpful"
14,Sebastian K,2,"Don’t fly VA if you want to get to your destination on time!<br>My family and me have flown with VA a few times in the hope of it getting better but almost every single time our flights were cancelled or rescheduled in a way that made that made no sense considering our connecting flights. We had to cancel one holiday completely due to constant flight changes and a customer service team that is non-responsive and not at all understanding or let alone helpful. Another time I got stranded in Ho Chi Minh for more than a day with refusing to pay for reasonable accommodation, transport costs or compensation owed under EU law.<br>While ticket prices are tempting, it’s not worth the pain of dealing with constant flight changes (by days, not hours!)  and delays."
14,vincentlO741VW,4,Vietnam Air is one of growing airlines in ASEAN region despite 1st timer experience and also to cover most of busy routes for the travelers demand.<br>In term of services and customer treatment are on the acceptance standard.
14,GoPlaces08572189482,5,"Can't express how much I enjoyed flying with VNA. The foods are amazing, the staffs are all supportive, the aircraft is spotless clean. Highly recommend."
14,Eloise W,5,We were very impressed with the level of service we got from our check in attendant Hoang Nhu. We had a difficult bit of luggage to check in and he was extremely helpful. Have already flown another 2 trips with this airline as well and have zero complaints.
15,Franziska K,1,"I used to fly frequently with Vietnam Airlines for work on national flights and never had any issues. We therefore decided to also fly with them to Germany. This was the worst experience ever. The cabin staff was so rude, yelling at me and my sleeping infant son telling me that he was not allowed to be sleeping on his seat and that I needed to put the seatbelt on him. No one else was wearing seatbelts. People were walking around the plane. The flight attend would only leave us alone once I held him in my arms. I wonder why we pay for an extra seat if he is not allowed to use it? Never ever again this airline."
15,bastinho5,5,"We flew with this airline several times on our Vietnam round trip and were thrilled every time.<br>The flight attendants were always very friendly and courteous. The fact that we were allowed to take our child's stroller on board was also not a problem on any of the flights - a big plus for us. In any case, the child-friendliness of this airline deserves special mention.<br>Unfortunately, our experience with the competitor airline VietJet was completely the opposite.<br>We would definitely book Vietnam Airlines again!"
15,Janine M,5,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines already 5 times and can 100% recommend. They are always on time, boarding is fast and efficient, never any bags lost and very friendly staff. Also always provide wet tissues and bottled water even for very short distance flights."
15,yannsy2021,5,"Vietnam Airlines exceeded all our expectations. Very professional and uber-friendly cabin staff, delicious food, plenty of space, excellent in-flight entertainment, and consistently most affordable for business class fares. Also, the coolest safety video we've see so far (seriously, it's great - check it out on Youtube).<br><br>Flying out of Australia, they provide a couple of daily flights from Sydney and Melbourne with connections in Saigon and/or Hanoi. Super quick check-in, then straight to the SkyTeam lounge (which is lovely, at least in Sydney - haven't tried Melbourne), and priority boarding.<br><br>Then they actual fun begins: great service, amazing (and very plentiful) food, both Vietnamese and European. Excellent seats, with all the bells and whistles expected in a modern, long-haul biz class. Warning: do not eat much at all at least 3 hours before take-off, because lunch on board is simply massive (and super yummy), served barely an hour after take-off.<br><br>Lounges in Saigon are perfectly nice (but more on this later re: the airport itself). Great, friendly service at all times.<br><br>We were on our honeymoon and somehow the attendants picked up on it and managed to fashion a lovely bouquet made of napkins - an hour before landing in Paris! With a lovely card written by the Captain and Bursar - again, just as they were wrapping everything up before arrival. It brought a little tear to our eyes, despite having travelled for nearly 30 hours by that point.<br><br>I could not recommend VN more, especially for J travellers. They're wonderful, and I hope they will continue to serve Australia for a very long time!<br><br>One drawback, which is not something Vietnam Airlines themselves can address: the airport in Saigon is showing its great age. The new airport has barely broken ground, so it'll be a few years before a fantastic airline benefits from the modern, international airport it deserves. Might be worth checking out Hanoi's recent new terminal for comparison."
15,Hugo H,1,"Horrific treatment - refused entry onto flight due to check in staff role playing as border security with some made up rule about emergency passports which I confirmed with the British, Cambodian and Vietnamese embassy to be false. Man in charge was extremely rude and unhelpful - be wary of you are travelling with emergency documentation."
16,Theo R,5,"Great effort on waste in the meal trays! Much appreciated reusable cutlery, carton boxes and reuse of headphones.<br>Could continue on even more items !"
16,Kiều Linh,5,I really appreciate vietnam airlines service. I enjoy the moment that I had with VNA. The food is delicious 😋 the flight attendants are very pretty and kind.
16,Joshua R,1,"This is a pretty horrible airline. It's fine once you're on the flight, pretty easy going and all that. But getting on the flight is a nightmare. <br>- Our flight was changed last minute about 3 times leading up to the date. We needed to contact the airline to re-arrange the flight as it meant we would miss our connecting (which was also with them). <br>There's no customer service, contact numbers/emails not working, unable to get updates on flights, all sorts of problems.<br><br>Not worth the head-ache!"
16,Phuong N,1,"I had the worst experience ever with the check in team at VNairline Sydney airport. I thought they live in Australia, they will understand better than others. Me and my little infant only 10 weeks old. We had to travel back to VN cause my dad is really sick. At the check bag I asked them nicely if I can get priority check only 1 bag because I have very small kid. The staff said:”no kid priority, stay in line as the type of ticket you bought” okay fine! The way they said sound like I use my baby to get the priority. Even the passengers they saw how rude the staff was and they let us join in the line with them so that my baby didn’t have to stay in the queue for 2 hours and he may frustrated and cry. Not only that! The same team were at the boarding gate, me and another mum who has 5months old kid asked if we can boarded first so that the baby can settle. The indian staff said” your ticket is economy and you are now standing at business class, you have to go to economy line” and the line was so long. I said I understand that but that is common sense, and should care more for the baby. If I travel with my husband, I will not need to ask their help. But they have no sympathy at all and unhelpful. The guy told me:” if you don’t wanna stay in the line, just sit somewhere else and wait till the end”. End up me and my baby boarding last. The fat Aussie guy at the gate force me to take the baby out and fold the pram before I get into the tunnel to the plane. And I had 2 big bags on 2 hands, one back pack. I asked him how can I take my baby out and fold the pram at the same time? Then he said okay you can go through the tunnel but have to fold the pram before go to the plane. I was struggling at the door and the staff still pushing me to fold the pram. However the crew helped me with my luggage and the pram. Surprisingly, a 4 stars airline has no priority for small baby, maybe that’s why they are only stay at 4 stars!"
16,George,1,"Most terrible experience ever. The flight from Sydney to Paris involved two changes in Vietnam (via Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi). Two really bad things happened:<br>1) Suitcase lost (possibly in Vietnam) and there is absolutely no easy way to communicate with anyone to help you find it. I filed a report in Paris and received a reference number to track it through the worldtracer system. I arrived in Paris on the 17th of June and the good news was that they system showed the suitcase was found in Vietnam and was about to arrive in Paris on the 20th. It must have arrived in Paris but there seems to be no system at the airport to receive it? I was leaving Paris on the 23rd to other parts of Europe. It is now the 1st of July and no signs of the suitcase. After 100s of phone calls to phones that nobody picks up and many emails (a great way to spend your holiday), I got hold of the lost and found department of vietnam airlines who seem to know more or less of what I know through the worldtracer system. They can at least do some of the chasing and seem more effective than I on providing updates. I only got hold of these people after contacting the headquarters online email of vietnam airlines (onlinesupport@vietnamairlines.com). The initial response from that email address was useless too because they recommended me checking their website which I of course already had done. In summary, I had to keep writing the same thing many times until I started talking to the lost and found people in France. I of course had to buy these days many clothes and other essential survival items. The lost and found person voluntarily offered 80 USD for compensation which I declined because by the time someone deposits this amount in my bank account, the bank will take most of it in fees. To cut a long story short: avoid it, especially if you have a trip with connection flights and their customer support is close to zero.<br>2) While leaving from Sydney, half of the plane (essentially everyone heading somewhere else other than Vietnam) was told that because we have to walk to a different terminal in Ho Chi Minh City, we will need a Visa. Yes, it was our responsibility to know that, but nobody knew and nobody would have bought that ticket if they knew. Emergency Visa was offered from the flightcentre at the airport.. $500 Australian Dollars per person and overcrowded. I paid for 3 but because the 4th person of my family was Chinese, there was no option for emergency visa so we had to buy a new ticket for that person ($3300 Australian Dollars). Perhaps someone will read this post and avoid these costs in the future.<br><br>The last, minor issue, was that we had to pick up the luggages at Ho Chi Minh City and check them back in for the connection flight. They were not transferred within the airport.<br><br>Lesson learnt. I will also post this review elsewhere."
17,Natalie M,1,"WARNING!!!!!<br><br>We had a flight from Sydney to Siem Reap booked for October and got an email 2 days ago saying the connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh to Siem Reap has been cancelled.<br><br>It has been 2 days of getting a run around  with them to discuss options.<br><br>They have given mixed information and keep getting our dates mixed up in their replies.<br><br>I have asked how long it will take for a refund to be processed if we decide to do this, they have not answered me over 3 emails. There had been way more about the other stuff.<br><br>Keep saying email another department but I did and still no direct answer. <br><br>I had to buy credit to call them in their international call Centre line which took hours to arrange and The phone guy says 30-45 business days in broken English which is not acceptable when I need to book with someone else. He also said they would cover our accommodation due to the major schedule change but the email reply says no - but quoted me for the wrong flight date :(<br><br>There was no STPC offered in the end  due to this major schedule change where the only thing on offer is to overnight in Ho Chi Minh at our expense with accommodation and visas and lose over nearly 2 days of our travel time transiting.<br><br>I’m so over it after 2 days of this.

17,Tourists,1,"My wife and I flew to Hoi An Economy class but decided to upgrade to premium economy going back to Ho Chi Min to Australia. This cost us over A$300 each. What a waste of money. As soon as we got to our seats, we found that my wife's tray table was broken so that it was difficult to keep food from sliding off. My seat belt did not work which I am sure contravenes air safety regulations and on landing in Melbourne my seat would not return to its proper position and the footrest would not retract. According to their advertising the menu and drink service was supposed to be upgraded. This certainly was not the case as it appeared to be exactly the same as economy class. This is in no way a criticism of the staff as we found them very professional and polite. I hope that Vietnam Airlines services the outside of the plane a lot better Than the inside. VERY DISSAPOINTED."
17,Khema A,1,"Not reliable at all. We booked our flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City and then connection to Siem Reap Cambodia. We received an email today that connection flight has been pre-poned which we cannot  catch because it will depart even before we arrive from Sydney.  All our further flights are already booked according to our planned days for different places in Cambodia and Vietnam.  My annual leave is booked already, cannot change. What an utter nonsense, Vietnamese airline cannot even manage 1:15 hours short flight.  Even if we manage to pre-pone our flight at starting point, there is no guarantee that they will not reschedule flight.. pathetic and not at all reliable..look for any better option guys!!!!!"
17,Bindiya S,1,"The flight was due for 10pm and a delay of at least 1.5hours has been recently announced. No organisation. No planning, servers have been down and air lines are showing a super delayed response. The uncertainty of delay is in itself an annoying issue. We have been standing in que since 2.5 hours now. Is this how a flight should function? <br>Pathetic service. Not recommended at all. Kindly prefer other options instead."

18,Anders P,4,"Hanoi-Hue 14 June on an A321 well-maintained older aircraft. Arrived to T1 from T2 after international flight. Free terminal bus at Noi Bay airport is very convenient. Check-in easy and superfast for Skypriority card holders, they gave me a spacious seat. Lounge access is not granted to VNs domestic routes unless if arrived on international Skyteam, flight, preferably VN. Paid 20 USD for access to Lotus Lounge which is impressive, large, well-stocked, and truly worth it. Onboard, I got just water and a tissue. However, they have started to push a trolley around for small, additional catering sales. Did not observe in time and lost my chance. Flight almost on time; luggage was present at arrival. Surprised there was an airbridge, then came the big surprise to my day: went into a completely new, stunning, modern airport in Hue. This shocked me completely; it was not there half year ago. Stable, old-fashioned airline, punctual, and good in communication. Generous with luggage. Miles given quickly. Advise: bring your own instant coffee sachets and they’ll make coffee in a paper mug for you onboard. Nice touch!"

18,freakytsz,1,"Bought a Vietnam Airlines flight from Opodo -<br>VN931 on 7 April 2023 was cancelled - all passengers were in chaos at Luang Prabang airport each trying to find their own solution. We were promised a full refund by the airline and was then transported to a VERY DIRTY and NOISY ""hotel"". Today we are 7 June 2023 - still no refund, after emails and emails ad calls and calls. Vietnam Airlines? Nowhere to be found/heard... <br><br>And then there is OPODO, the agent who sold us the tickets: them charging a service fee - fine with that except that when the flight was cancelled - Opodo doesn't move a finger!<br>Vietnam Airlines told me to seek refund from Opodo because they sold me the ticket - and Opodo?

19,LynneMcC66,5,"On our outbound flight the staff, food, comfort and cleanliness were second to none.  The business class 'pods' have a seat which reclines into a full bed were excellent.  The herring bone style arrangement meant you had some privacy also.  The TV had a good selection although I mostly used the flight tracker to see where we were flying over.   The food just kept coming and was delicious and fresh.  Crew were very friendly and nothing was any bother to them.  On our return flight I was a little less impressed.  The TV did not work and the dinner choices were not to my liking this time - however when I said I would just have cereal for breakfast they still plied me with breads, fruit and yoghurt which was fine.  I was a wee bit unwell on this flight so did not sleep great so that probably impacted on my views.  Overall a really good experience at an excellent price.  Would certainly use Vietnam Airlines again when we return to Cambodia."
19,nobody,1,"I cannot even book my ticket. This happens EVERYTIME I try to book flights on the website or on the app. I have flown Vietnam airlines several times, as the service is good. It is beyond frustrating to try and buy tickets though. 3.5 hours later I still cannot book. I keep getting error codes. Unable to contact customer service. They really need to fix their technical issues, as it is a joke!!"
19,Mercy N,1,"Anyone planing to visit Vietnam, I’d advise you to book from a different airline. If you’ve traveled on any other international airlines you’ll find that vietnam lacks the flexibility to make changes on your flight from their website. You are forced to write and respond to bots to make changes on your flight. The website is poor poorly developed btw. <br>I found it very off putting that they had so many hidden costs for changes on their flight. For example the change fee listed on their policy is around 20 euros however, when I requested a refund of my flight, I got an automatic reply email that listed a 75euro/flight change fee. <br>Vietnam airline is definitely a 0/10 for me,I’m never booking with them and wouldn’t recommend them either. Other companies e,g Qatar and Emirates would be the idea alternative."
19,vincentobrien,3,"Had multiple flights with Vietnam Airlines, both international and internal.  Flights were functional but not great.  Times were all changes prior to departure, and on occasions we were not informed of the schedule change.  It caused a lot of issues having to re-arrange accommodation, transfers, etc.  Not impressed.<br><br>Once at the airport, flights were on time.  Only 3 of 6 toilets working on the long haul flights.  Limited drink service and they ran out of most drinks anyway by a couple of hours into the flights."
19,Soko37,3,"Smooth check in and surprisingly immigration check with scanner in Saigon as well, just short waiting time. Great confusion during boarding as the gate was changing for more flights. Boarding fast, no all seats occupied. Take off delayed almost one hour very probably due to previous heavy rain. Good meal with spicy 🌶️ beef 🥩 noodles 🍜. Huge crowds in KL at immigration check, crazy"
20,Aneb2000,4,"We booked Vietnam Airlines for a domestic flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. Having been working in the airline industry for so many years, I was pretty impressed with the airline. The aircraft was very neat and the service was also good. What stood out most was the safety video played which was not the usual boring stuff. They have tried to keep the passengers attention stuck on the video.  I was also impressed by the inflight entertainment. I will recommend this to anyone planning a trip in/out/within Vietnam."
20,Steve S,1,"Do not fly with this company if you are a Disabled American Veteran. They would not accommodate me and my service dog. They lie on their website that they accept service animals. They cost me hundreds of dollars in wasted fares, health certifications, and time. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
20,Adam H,3,"Travelled to Vietnam business class for a work trip. I have flown business class with a few other airlines and for the money I paid to travel business class on Vietnam Airlines is was not worth it. Business class pod was very squashy , food was terrible and when I went to order a drink from their menu nothing was available that I picked. When I did finally settle on a drink I had two and was then told no more as they had run out of the ingredients.  The seat was uncomfortable and when I put the bed down on our return flight I could not fit properly , the pillow and blanket were old , tired and dirty looking. Next time I travel to Vietnam I will definitely use a different carrier."
20,jinajinachew,1,"I have a booking with VNA to go back HCM and I would like to change my departure ticket to the earlier date so I made a call to support center, they informed me that will have changers for the change with XX SGD. So i do agree with it and the supporter ask me to send it by the email cause call centre unable to handle this matter. I emailed to online support and they come back with me with the same fare as spoken in the phone so I confirmed and send them my payment card. But after that they dont response to my email for like 3 hours, so I sent a follows up email. This time they response me with a new fare, said they previous was a mistake without any apologise. I called call center, they push it to email team, email team unable to solve and give the reason that we have to accept it. And after I explaining that its airline fault for reply late make the fee goes up, they come back and told me that they need to collect extra more airport fee. So in 3 solution emails, they given me 3 difference fares. From end to end process, ms Nguyen Thuy Trang is the responder and she dont even say sorry for her mistake. So please beware if you have any issue with the airline, they might not help to solve it."
20,Soko37,3,"Online check in done via app,  check in counter without any delays. Immigration and scanner is terrible due to one hour waiting and queuing . Boarding smooth even gate was changed, got lunch 🥗. Not great taste, it is more feeling full. Landing on Jakarta on time with almost full plane"
21,Omar L,2,"a bad customer service, poor explanations, very unclear policies. moved my flight, cause me inconveninences saying all the benefits would have been the same. turned to be not exactly as it was. very disappointed as a freqeunt flier."
21,NeilD223,5,"Another great flight with Vietnam Airlines.  More leg room than other carriers, not bad food for an airline and very nice cabin staff who do their best to help you.   Yes, things go wrong.  4 of us flew and one had an issue with the inflight entertainment system.  These things happen.  crew member did everything she could to fix it, coming back to us multiple times to try to see if it was working in between doing everything else she had to do.  In the end she couldnt fix it so she moved the passenger to another seat with more legroom and a working unit."
21,Josephine L,1,"WHAT A POOR AIRLINE!<br><br>First, our  return flight in the late evening is cancelled and rescheduled to the early morning (&gt;6 hours earlier than my original flight) WITHOUT any notification until I check it from the website. This happened before 3 days of my planned trip and the hotel reservation cannot be refunded already. <br><br>And then, I receive their notification about my outbound flight would be delayed 2 hours in the morning of the scheduled flight...<br><br>WHAT? Don't you know the ticket for a earlier outbound flight and a later return flight is far more expensive? And the most disappointed point is they just inform you the flight was changed without explaining and even no notification, not to mention compensation.<br><br>I would never take this airline again."
21,mastar,1,When you pay more than $1000 for a premium economy seat your expectation is it would worl and recline especially during a much needed red eye flight to Sydney<br>Well mine didnt. <br>Cabin crew were very apologetic and did their best<br>There was a vacnt middle bulk head they offered. I declined as i wanted a window seat as not to be disturbed. My aisle seat passenger volunteered to swap and returned back to his original seat knowing it was a bas idea. <br>Nonetheless - it appears i have been shafted by Vietnam airlines and was offer a humiliating $66 voucher for my inconvenience. <br>Apparently they may or may not get back to me. <br>My gut tells me they dont care and if you get shafted and betrayed - tough luck. Take them tk court maybe <br>So thus experience is particularly bittwr and the non customer service by vietnam airline's management has not surprised me<br>You get a cheap flight with Vietnam airlines- then take your chances<br>Good luck
21,Ngoc T,1,I will never want to use Vietnam airline again. Both ways got delayed by 2-3 hours👎 . We were waiting in the airport for 6 hours.
22,Anon100001,4,"Flights were good, veg food was fine, service was good. Entertainment was ok. I really like the space on the A350 (cabin and toilets were really spacious) but what I disliked was the constant change of schedules (we had 4 flights and 3 of the schedule changed last minute which made our planning quite difficult).  I would like to fly with them again but the schedule changes makes things a challenge and really needs to be addressed. The recline is a good but goes quite far back, can disturb the passengers behind you."
22,Julia C,5,"I had a great experience flying Vietnam Airlines for the first time! They are very efficient with boarding, taking off on time, and coming through with food/drinks/garbage service. Loved them!"
22,Zia,2,We have a flight from Incheon to Jakarta through Ho Chi Minh City and we asked for a through check in but the staff said that we have to bring our luggage if we want to enter Ho Chi Minh (our transfer flight is more than 20hours). The staff was not friendly and she talked about our situation in a bad way to another staff in Korean because she thought we couldn’t understand Korean. She called her manager and the manager immediately said that we can get a through check in.
22,Sandave5756,5,"We really enjoyed our flight on Vietnam Airways from Bangkok to Hanoi. It was a relatively older plane but it was really clean and very comfortable and the flight attendants were very professional and friendly. I loved their uniform, traditional Vietnamese dress and I loved how respectful their culture is. Our flight was only just over 2 hours but we were served drinks and a very nice meal.  It just all felt very comfortable and welcoming and was a great introduction to Vietnam."
22,Sarahsue,1,"The service of flying business and the facilities were all good, the lounge was decent with decent food and drink choices at Changi airport. my both busincess class flights facilities were comfortable on the plane, good quality food. However, my 29 inch suitcase wheel was broken from singapore to phu quoc but I didnt bother taking a photo and claim the airline, thinking it was a random incidence. But it happened again right after i leave phu quoc and flew to busan on business class, my brand new 29 inch suitcase 2 wheels are destroyed!! What a lack of care airline treating the passengers luggage like garbage. This time I took a photo and sent to their department afterwards but little can be done by them as you needed to submit right there at the airport. What a poor managed airline, what a shame as the in plane service was good but the luggage department did a abhorring terrible job which will eventually cause a damage to the airline. That was my last flight from VIETNAM AIRLINE  unless you want to have your luggage broken or any sort of misfortune to happen to your wonderful holiday."
23,dahokolomok,1,"This is the most shocking. I made a booking directly on their website, for this exact reason - if they cancel flights, I expect to be able to get communications about it via email, SMS, or phone. As the booking is direct.<br><br>Imagine my shock when I checked three days before my flight, that they had cancelled that flight, and moved me to the next day! Without a single email, SMS, or call to inform me.<br><br>Calling their phone number is useless, as it gives you hold music, and then 1-2 minutes later, says ""all agents busy, call back later"" and disconnects you.<br><br>Then I went to a local branch of theirs in Hue city, as I was already in Vietnam. The person was useless - saying that they don't have power to refund (need to fill in online form), nor put me on another airline flight on the same day.<br><br>The saving grace is that at least their cancellation process is easy. You log in online to your booking, and click refund. You get an email within hours; and they offered a full refund, as expected. Waiting to get it back to the card though...  so lets see.<br><br>Overall, I would avoid Vietnam Airlines. Or if you do decide to book, use a third party online travel agent like Expedia, as the Vietnam Airlines notification process is useless for cancellations or flight changes. And keep checking your booking every few days... in case they cancel!"
23,Soko37,4,"Returning back to Saigon after few days in North of Vietnam. Very luck to use VN airline express service option to take earlier flight in case available seat 2h prior your originally booked departure time, for free.  We saved 1h and coming earlier home. Check is was great support for earlier flight, boarding began on time but take off was already late, lading late. I was happy for hot meal and tea. Normally, I was used to get just sandwich. Small plane, no TV but anyhow I was very tired and sleepy"
23,Ashley B,1,"We booked a return flight to SFO through Ho Chi Minh City with Vietnam Air. Website wouldn’t let us check in online, giving various different error messages every time. We tried the chat function for customer service, only to be told we needed to phone. Upon phoning, we received a message they were busy and to call back later. They promptly disconnected the call. Repeat multiple times. <br><br>After hours of phoning to check in for our call, we finally spoke to someone. We checked in and asked about upgrades, only to be told we had to call a different number for that. This was all a massive red flag, so we decided to cancel our flight and book with United. Of course, we were unable to cancel online and had to go through the hassle of phoning repeatedly AGAIN, receiving multiple busy messages AGAIN. We were finally able to connect with a representative who canceled our flights and assured us that we would not be charged the no show fee that was listed on their website when we tried (unsuccessfully) to cancel online. Much to our surprise, the agent offered to refund most of the ticket price, despite it being less than 24 hours until departure. We were cautiously optimistic. The icing on the cake, however, was a call from our credit card company when we arrived home, asking if we had authorized a $3000 charge to Vietnam Airlines on the day we canceled the flight. A $3000 no show fee, perhaps? You’ve got to be kidding me."
23,Soko37,3,"No passenger’s at the counter for check in early morning hour. All went well, passport check quick probably for same reason. Using priority boarding was quick, generally boarding could be organised much better using in steps instead people getting first and struggling with luggage in first rows and blocking people passing to last rows. We took off late due to military aircraft exercise but got to Hanoi in time. Got humble breakfast and 🫖 , small bun and yogurt, better than nothing. Flight with no turbulence and smooth landing"
23,nipu56,5,"I alongwith my wife flew from Delhi - Hanoi , Ho chi Minh- Siem Reap, Hanoi - Delhi in April 2023. It is such a wonderful airlines. Food was excellent, Service was prompt and it deserves higher rating. The seats in A321 were comfortable. The planes are latest and clean. They should consider having tv screens on each seat."
24,Kevin,1,"After more than 70 flights in the last 5 years, this is the first time that I'm writing a review, because they really... deserve one.<br><br>The story: I tried to check in with a backpack and a plastic bag, but the service insisted on that the plastic bag counts as second luggage - and only one was allowed as carry-on.<br><br>I asked to pay extra for the extra bag, but they said that 1 carry-on per person is the maximum and that my plastic bag has to board like normal luggage.<br><br>The end was: I had to pay another ~$25 for the plastic bag to get wrapped up and on the plane, but since the plastic bag wasn't made for not being used as carry-on, the content broke."
24,Aline,4,I have had an issue with a booking and the customer support resolved my issue quick and to my satisfaction.
24,sevenzeroseven,2,"Be careful when you book business class with Vietnam Airlines. Business class in an old A320. No power sockets and old seats, which can hardly recline. Food about the same as economy. No service after they served the meal after take off. Overhead bin storage limited. Save your money and fly economy on this route. I hope that they bring back the A350 on this route soon."
24,Agnes L,1,"Absolutely appalled by Vietnam Airlines! They switched our flight time from Hong Kong to Hanoi without any email notifications and delayed our flight for 2 days without providing any hotel compensation. When we tried to contact their customer service team to resolve the issue, they hung up on us! This is unacceptable! We paid for a service and expected a stress-free travel experience, but instead, we got a nightmare. We demand better treatment from Vietnam Airlines. #VietnamAirlines #CustomerServiceFail #DelayedWithoutCompensation #Frustrated"
24,Fabio L,1,"This company is basically a little sample of everything going wrong in the country.<br><br>So, basically what happened was that I had a delay regarding the delivery of my new business visa, so, I needed to change my return flight to Ho Chi Minh from Bangkok, initially scheduled on the 27th of March to the 30th instead, change on which they charged me over 2 millions vnd.<br>What was my surprise to discover that they didn't even change the date of flight at all! The new ticket was STILL on the 27th instead of the 30th like I asked!<br>So, I've tried to email them, call them to find a solution, they didn't bother pulling their fingers out of their rear, as a consequence, I asked for a refund and they keep joking around and send me emails with the wrong refund information that belong to OTHER people!!! As proven on the picture I posted on this review. <br>All information are totally wrong, so, what do I need to do for them to treat me respectfully? Do I need to go to their office and start slapping some sense into their minds or can we still find a civilized solution?! <br><br>This is essentially a company of gangsters who are only alive to make your experience miserable and steal your money, I'll NEVER use this company EVER again and nobody else should, maybe once you start hitting on their PRECIOUS money they will finally start to understand they need to do better and stop treating their customers like garbage."
25,Wayne F,5,"I have travelled  with Vietnam Airlines several times now and every time is always excellent. The staff are fantastic, the planes is always clean and on time!!<br><br>I thoroughly recommend Vietnam for your overseas travel especially to Vietnam.<br><br>Cheers"
25,Keegan,5,"Tons of leg room, comfortable seats, free water, fast check in, semi friendly staff, and flight leaves on time. As far as Vietnam airlines go this one is by far the best. Highly recommend for domestic flights."
25,Werewolf’s,1,"I would stay away from this airline. They suck, the strong bribe culture, uncivilized staff and too many nonsense. Recently 4 of the crews got caught while carrying 11kg of heroine. 4 of them got released because they did not know they were transporting heroine. They irrationally stated that someone paid them to transport toothpaste and they just thought everything was toothpaste. Sound like a joke right"
25,Juri R,4,"Roundtrip in Vietnam, HCMC - Phu Quoc - Hanoi - HCMC. Good service during the flight, exit seats with no extra cost. Check in - boarding worked well, no huge queues. Couple changes in flight times and information from those was good. Good value for money, recommend."
25,Alona,1,"I purchased a one way flight from Vietnam to Hanoi VN0593 for 31 March 2023. <br><br>However, the airline suddenly changed my flight date to 2 April, which is two days later my original departure.&nbsp;<br><br>No help (no reschedule or refund) was being offered to me. Customer service was not helpful at all! <br><br>Atrocious experience!"
26,Anders P,4,"Danang-Bangkok 9 March 2023 on a narrowbody A321 aircraft. On time. Good deal; less than 100 USD. SKYTEAM privileges were granted in full despite the ticket was shamelessly cheap. Thus, VN overrules competitors on this route, even my favourite well-pampering local airline Bangkok Airways which in this case lose out to VN on price, lounge, and luggage allowance. The LCC carriers are a no go on this route as they end up expensive and/or unreliable. Worse is that they don’t provide any luggage transfer in Bangkok, forcing pax to go landside and check it in again. Vietnam Airlines have almost never any delay nor cancellation on this route. Check in could not transfer my luggage to final destination, though at least to next destination (Doha with QR). Da Nang International (T2) is dominated by SE-Asian tourists and a lot number of small airlines. Larger aircrafts cant enter the airport as it is in the middle of the city. The Airport is completely renovated and a pleasure. Check-In fast and easy I was treated with a lot of respect due to SKYTEAM status, despite I was travelling on cheapest ticket possible. I could get my 23x2 kg checked it without any questions and I also had two hand-luggages. The Lotus Lounge, that Skyteam-airlines use, is extremely nice and well maintained; it is a huge, unexpected gem find in a small airport. The Lounge has very good food offerings; cold delicatesses, and at least 7 hot meals in buffet. Drink options are a bit below average and only cheaper, local products (2 cheap wines and 4 beer brands, all alike) are offered. Background music appreciated. The décor is of high standard; even smoking and business rooms exist. The lounge appears underutilised, I found only 5-10 other visitors during the 3 hours I spent there. The flight itself was stable and regular. Crew were courteous; food modest only a sandwich tray and drinks were offered. Without requesting it, I was given a seat in the first row after business class – that granted me wide leg space. Luggage transferred correctly as promised and tagged. Good value for money, reliable, and recommended."
26,Davidlloyd12,3,"I’ve just recently been on a work trip to Australia, and having flown out from Heathrow to Melbourne via Perth on the Qantas flight in Premium Economy I can say there’s a huge gulf between them and Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>My first leg on the return journey via Ho Chi Min on the Airbus was ok, for the 8 hour flight the food was a chicken pasty (spicy) but pretty poor selection. No menus given out during the flights for meal selection.  <br><br>The second leg from Ho Chi Min on the Boeing 787, again was not great, there was lack of drink selection on the alcohol side, unlike our Quanta’s flight out we had a good range of drinks and food on both flights. There was also only orange, coke and water out for you to help yourself to. Unlike Quanta’s that left out a good selection of drinks and snacks in the galley during the flight. TV’s are stowed between seats, which causes an upheaval anytime you want to move out of your seat. Surely screens set in the seat in front are fare more practical. <br><br>A final point..if you want to use the toilet during the flight when seated in a window seat be prepared for a struggle! If the people on front have their seat reclined you aren’t getting out. <br><br>All in all, the old adage rings true. You pay for what you get. In this case Vietnam Airlines were below expectation, and Quantas nailed it."
26,Coastal614663,1,"The aeroplanes are old. Movie selection old. One of the airhosttess bumped quite hard into me and walked past no apology but the worst was the apauling food they served vegetarians today. I would not even serve that food to my dog. Dried out old noodles, tastless &amp; no sauce. It was disgusting - like an after thought. I will never fly with them again."
26,Luv2Go56,5,"We flew roundtrip on Vietnam Airlines during our November trip to Vietnam.  The international trip was from Seoul, South Korea, and the domestic flight was Hanoi to DaNang.  The service on all 4 flights was exceptional in business class, and the meals were good.  The flight attendants quickly took our bags and put them in the overhead with a smile!  We highly recommend Vietnam Airlines - no complaints or recommendations for improvement."
26,Soko37,3,"Staff very helpful to reschedule the flight for earlier option. Bit waiting and worried but lady managed well. Boarding via bus was ok and took bit longer time, plane not fully occupied, no turbulence and ok landing. Snack was white flour sandwich, really low level. Basic offer for drink, just water, tea and coffee"
27,thomas l,5,First time flight experience with vietnam airlines . Service very good and the food was fine and the seat comfort for long flight.
27,Jess,4,"Friendly staff, quick/efficient check in, free bottle of water on the plane and comfy seats. We left approx. 40-45 minutes late, however this was not particularly inconvenience - we were kept informed about the delay."
27,Soko37,3,"Check in was done in priority lane for elite members with no waiting. Boarding late due to late landing of previous flight, landing with almost no delay according schedule. Snack was white baguette, really low level. Pleasant flight generally with no turbulence, so lucky"
27,Liza H,3,"Requesting for the wheelchair service was a tedious process via phone and email. It could have been easy if the online form system had no errors messages popping up upon submission or if the online chat support has someone replying back.<br><br>We came early at Tan Son Nhat airport to check in so that we could enjoy some shopping at the transit lounge but was expected to wait till near boarding time for a staff to assist pushing their airline wheelchair until i voiced out that it was not fair. Apparently they don't allow us to push her by ourselves in there which was weird. <br><br>A female staff came over to push my mom through immigration with a black face. She was rude and reluctant to assist. Instead she asked mom who has reduced mobility to stand up and walk through the body scanner on her own. <br><br>The rest of the staff at the boarding gate helping out my mom get onboard the aircraft were much friendlier and accomodating.<br><br>Flight was decent. Air conditioning was not strong. We requested for halal meals. We got two chicken potato puff pastry on the plate, a bag of crispy prata and fruits. A little disappointing I must say as there was no gravy or condiments to go along with it making the meal quite bland. The airline has a halal catering kitchen yet they can't even provide a decent halal meal like rice or noodles to muslim passengers on international flights. <br><br>The inflight staff were friendly and helpful except for one male steward who was not wearing glasses. His tone of voice was unacceptable.<br><br>I had a wonderful experience on Vietnam airlines during my flights to Seoul and back years ago. This time i wanted my family to experience the airline's service from Ho Chi Minh back to Singapore. Standards seem to have dropped a little with too many processes."
27,Josh C,1,This company is a joke! They cancelled our flight 3 years ago and still haven't refunded us the £800 they owe us. Absolutely shocking to have waited this long for an entitled refund and still nothing has been done and they are ignoring it. DO NOT EVER FLY WITH VIETNAM AIRLINES
28,Pete N,1,"Me and mom was booking with Vietnam airlines. But they showed up on the gate screen that the fly was delay due to bad weather. Then somehow, we end up with different airlines ( parcific airlines). Seem like the combine both airlines together. <br>The Parcific airlnes was not up to my expectation with vietnam airlines. They still have some sticky tape stick to the chair. It look like they use it to attach on-off other equipments. The fly was not so pleasure. <br>To sum up, VNairlines was combine our fly with other airlines without announcements before hand. Furthermore, the second airlines was not up to our expectations with vietnam airlines.<br>Well, consider your price/quality before purchase this doggy airlines. Do not be fool like us."
28,Atty F,5,"I flew from Sydney to London via Hanoi with Vietnam Airlines and had the most amazing experience. <br>I unfortunately became really sick on the fight from Sydney to Hanoi. The air hostess noticed I wasn't well and got me hot water, a heat pack, bread rolls, gatorade and anything else she thought would help me feel better throughout the flight. She checked back 30 minutes later and realised I still wasn't well so called over the speaker for doctors on the plane to come over and help me. She even moved one of the doctors to the row in front of me that had a spare seat so that the doctor was close by if needed. The air crew would check in on me every 20 minutes to see how I was feeling and see if they could get me anything to help. They had medications on board they were able to provide me at the request of the doctor. They even arranged for a wheelchair to take me off the plane when we arrived in Hanoi to the doctor at the airport. The air host wheeled me to the doctor and explained the situation.  <br>The air crew passed on the the team on our next flight from Hanoi to London that I wasn't feeling well and the crew on the second flight then checked in on me to see how I was feeling and if there was anything they could do to help. <br>I have never had such amazing customer service and felt so looked after in a time when I wasn't feeling well. <br><br>We paid for premium economy as this allowed us to bring 2 x 23kg bags and 2 x carry on bags which cost the same as flying economy adding on an extra bag. The seats were extremely comfy with plenty of leg room. <br><br>Overall this was a great flight and I can't thank the Vietnam Airline's crew enough for their support and kindness throughout the flight. They were so so helpful and nice going above and beyond to make me feel better and make sure I made my next flight from Hanoi to London."
28,YU KANG,1,"The worst airline ever and forever, they charge me laptop backpack as a luggage and must be checked in, will charge me $80, just feeling they are so poor, need money for any reason. I cancelled my ticket and lost all move and bought a new ticket from Thai Smile. This is the 2nd time VA fooled me, all their tickets have a free bag but not mine, I could not find any ticket without free bag before and after my flight. Be careful when you fly in South East Asian countries, no loyalty program from the US can be recognized here, and they treat passengers without any altitude in the checkin counter if run by the airport authority, all the employees work for airport authorities in South East Asian countries are from powerful families that people in western world would never realize, they are VIP not you!"
28,Natalia Toth,3,"My Vietnamese friend recommend that we take this airline as the best of Vietnam. Unfortunately, it was rather bad. The seats are very old and need urgent renovation. As for food, they gave us tuna sandwiches that smelled awful and no one around me finished it because the taste was horrible. Right now I'm waiting for the flight to Hanoi with them and it has been delayed by 30 minutes. Don't fly with them unless you have no alternative."
28,Owen Reading,1,"My first flight with Vietnam airlines was a flight into Ho Chi Minh where our baggage was first left in Bangkok resulting in a 4.5 hour delay then when it arrived, was broken and cracked open. Vietnam airlines typically have refused responsibility and refund payment. <br><br>My second flights came with a trip to Phu Quoc over TET. Our flight there was rescheduled from an early afternoon flight to a night flight- resulting in us losing half a day of holiday. Our return flight was brought to early morning rather than late afternoon- resulting in us losing essentially a night and an early morning of our holiday. Vietnam Airlines customer service again awful and actually very rude, putting the phone down at one point. <br><br>Shocking- never again."
29,Sue T,1,"This Airlines communication is appalling. They randomly communicate quite significant alterations to schedule, layover time and don't even have the courtesy to explain fully why or what you're supposed to do about it. Then they charge a random unexplained fee to your credit card on what is supposed to be a fully flexible no penalty booking <br>They are rubbish"
29,Son Lam N,5,It was a direct flight from Ha Noi to Frankfurt. Menu for economy class is quite diverse with multiple choices of Asian and Western styled food. Staff are cheerful and nice.
29,Margiela M,1,"The worst ground staff we ever met. Refused to speak English but requested us to download app/ form, which we need clarification since this is not our first time to VN. We checked with our friends who boarded earlier and they didn’t need to do so we confronted till they let us go. Ridiculousas there are so many internet scam so we hesitate to download or click on any link until we are certain We tried to check on our booking T&amp;C and even VN website nothing mention of what they have requested us. Beware!"
29,ramang2016,5,"Very nice, great food service. Flight was on time, ground and flight crew were helpful and polite. Clean and efficient airline."
29,Sigutė K,1,"Flights are late, impossible to get some advise regarding upgrades or seat reservations, the app not functioning"
30,Brian,5,"Seat pitch was pretty nice for a two-hour domestic flight. Decent food, milk tea was also served onboard (which is really rare)."
30,Cuong L,1,Worst airline i ever experience toghether with canada airline. Only use this airline as last resource and expect your flight to be delayed if you ever fly with them . Thrir booking system is pretty schetchy also
30,Optionalextras2,4,"Actually in all we took four domestic flights with Vietnam Airlines. Can Tho-Danang, Hue-HCMC, HCMC-Phu Quoc and return.  Unlike the flights with them about 5 years ago, all were on time. Lounges available in all terminals visited, priority bus service. Boarding was odd in Hue as instead of being first to board we were last. <br>The seats are a little old but are fine, nice and wide. No IFE but not an issue for us. I really did not like the food served though. <br>Luggage came off the flights very quickly.<br>Overall was impressed with this airline and had no complaints."
30,Phil Nguyen,1,"I booked a trip from SGN to SEA from Delta Airlines, with the first flight SGN -&gt; ICN operated by Vietnam airlines. My tickets were long confirmed by Delta. When I was checking in with Vietnam Airlines, they first said they didn't find my name on the flight. When I showed them the ticket number, they said they found the ticket, but there was no seat on it, and the flight was full. So they redirected me to the ticket stand to resolve the issue, possibly booking a different flight to make the second ICN -&gt; SEA flight. The person at the ticket stand, to my surprise, told me both my tickets looked canceled with no seat. That made no sense, as my ICN -&gt; SEA ticket with Delta was a premium one with seat confirmed long ago. When I showed the person my confirmed Delta seat on the web, she told me ""No. You need to call Delta, you can't just look it up on the website like that. Both your tickets looked canceled on our end. There's nothing we can do"". When I called Delta, they said both my tickets were confirmed and saw no problem. Vietnam Airlines wasn't going to resolve the problem, and the back-and-forth also made it late (even though I showed up 3 hours before the flight), so I had to ask Delta to book me a different flight with Korean Air. Although the rebooking didn't cost me extra money, it costed me lots of time and comfort  (both economy flights, 6-hour delay, plus 18-hour layover, which was my only choice if I wanted to be back in the US in time).<br><br>This was my first time trying Vietnam Airlines. I'd figured I should support an airline from my home country and give them a chance despite all the horror stories in the past. I've learned my lesson. It won't be less than 10 years before I give them another chance, if I do."
30,Timo S,3,"Seats are comftable even my back rest was moving a bit. Entertainment is poor but we brought iPad with movies. USB Ports working and dual standard flight 3,5mm jack. You need an adapter to use your headset. Food was bad and not tasteful. Service was also quite slow and not very welcoming. For a long distance flight too less offer. We Booked a third check in luggage and even though the max weight each is 23kg my bag with 28kg was no problem because the first bag was only 16 kg. Plane departures at around 1400 from FFH so you will arrive in the middle of the night and they will wake all passengers around 0:00 for breakfast. I would recommend to take a late evening connection."
31,Pitt H,1,This is the worst airline by far worse than any other Budget airlines. It changed the schedule of your flight one week before the departure. In my case it has changed a 4 PM flight to a 7 AM flight. I don't think anybody would like to sleep until 5 AM and then go to the airport at that time and then arriving at the destination Maybe 8 AM and not able to check in their hotel or able to basically visit anything because everything is not open yet. There is a reason why afternoon flights are generally pricier than really extremely early morning flights and in this case Vietnam airlines have taken advantage of their customers or otherwise customers of other airlines by advertising flights At a afternoon time and then rescheduling to a very early morning flight at a later date. The problem is even if they give a full refund the travellers have already been negatively impacted financially given that now they have to rebook their fights with another airline with the time that may not be as good as previously an at a cost and price higher than a couple of weeks before obviously because it's already too late to book a flight. I laugh at those Vietnamese people who continue to praise this airlines And keep on Accepting their mistakes that it is making and continue to make. I have travelled on Vietnam airlines this is my 3rd time and this is 2 out of 3 of bad experiences that I had the other flight was that I had to travel it's the Interstate flight of one hour and the flight was delayed for 1 hour thank you. With the pricier tickets that they have you might as well choose the other budget airline given the poor services and that they have.

31,chris61_11,2,We flew up to Ho Chi Minh City from Melbourne on Jan 9 and back on Jan 22. We were in Premium Economy in Seats 11H and K. We soon noticed that the mechanisms on the tray tables which stow in the armrests were  broken and they could not be deployed without jamming. Also the seat recline were so stiff that it required a flight attendant to operate them. The flight attendants (who were lovely) were very apologetic and clearly embarrassed. They promised to report the matters. <br>On our return flight we were on the same aircraft and in the same seats. The tray table issue had not been fixed and neither had the seat recline. We had a conversation with the Cabin Manager and as always she was very apologetic . It is clear that with the quick turnaround of this aircraft that such matters are not a priority!<br>Other aspects of Premium Economy were also below expectations. The leg room and seat comfort were just OK. I suspect that the meals were the same as Economy and the wines were undrinkable. It is disappointing given that this is a gateway flight to this beautiful country . They really have to do better - their domestic service is very good and I don’t understand why they can’t match it internationally.
32,Julie D,2,"Was very excited to fly full service Vietnam airlines after endless delays with VietJet. Flight sat on tarmac for over an hour, then all put on bus back to airport where we waited again endlessly for new plane. Puts you off airplane travel full stop"
32,Danni,2,So I come to airport and find out i have been moved to pacific airline on a flight that is nearly two hours later and the lady at Vietnam airlines calls it an upgrade wtf? I'm going to miss another flight because of this?! They don't care about customer service..
32,Safari109514,1,"We had the bad luck of booking a flight through Vietnam airline's website that's operated by Pacific airlines.<br>Flight was delayed from 3pm to midnight! Offered absolutely nothing in return and when we approached the Vietnam airlines counter, they sent us over to Pacific airlines who couldn't do anything because they didn't have any other flights that day. If I book a flight on Vietnam airlines' website, I expect to deal with that airline. If Vietnam airlines wants to save whatever is left of their reputation, I would sincerely consider not selling any more flights on their website operated by pacific airlines, because my experience left me with a terrible impression of Pacific airlines but an even worse one of Vietnam airlines. Will avoid at all costs and I suggest everyone else do the same. There are other options with much better service."
32,John L,1,"Needed to log into my booking and change password. Couldn't get a OTP sent to my phone. Noticed country code on my tel was wrong but when I changed it it wouldn't update , kept reverting to VN +84. So can't sign in. Went to their office in Phu Quoc, been closed since May 22!!!!. Utter rubbish service, no wonder VN has lowest returning visitor rate of all SEA countries."
32,SN Chamaria,4,"Right from check in to arrival in New Delhi, every step has been hassle free.<br>Attentive crew, hospitality is felt by heart and not just cosmetic as we see elsewhere."
33,tyrrell,1,"from booked seating debarcles, contact numbers that do not connect , totally unsatisfactory service when eventual contact made, to being hung up on twice, web site errors, incorrectly rescheduled flights, refusal to forward luggage, duck shoving, blatant dishonestly, stonewalling the list goes on. Customer Service from Vietnam Airlines is terrible, appalling, totally unsatisfactory, , I am astounded at how many excuses were employed in order to refuse a reasonable solution and to disregard VA’s fault in the chain of events."
33,Daniel G,5,"Vietnam Airlines is a great airline to fly with. The comfort of the seats and the overall cleanliness of the aircraft are top-notch. The staff are also very friendly and provide excellent service.<br><br>I had the opportunity to fly with Vietnam Airlines both internationally and domestically, and I was impressed with the consistency of their service. The flight attendants were attentive and always available to assist with any needs.<br><br>On my domestic flight, the experience was just as great. The aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the staff were friendly and efficient.<br><br>Overall, I had a great experience flying with Vietnam Airlines and would highly recommend them for both international and domestic travel."
33,Travels,1,I recently booked flights with Vietnam Airlines. The website was not loading clearly on mobile phone so I contacted support to enquire if checked baggage was included in the flight they said yes with international flights. However they could not confirm until I had the booking reference number. I processed to book 2 tickets provided my booking reference number. They then notified me Baggage was not included and I would need to pay an additional $60 USD per passenger. <br><br>I contacted the support and help desk with screenshots of the issues with the website and the chat logs. However they refused to rectify the issue and stopped reply to my emails. <br><br>Do yourself a favour and book a budget airline and save money and have less headache.
33,Anders P,3,"Bangkok-Saigon-Hue close to New Year 2023. Both flights on A321. Both flights ½ hour delayed, which is acceptable on a last Friday prior to New Year. Check-in in Bangkok not very professional (could not communicate well, did not know African cities, could not retrieve info of my luggage from previous flights). However, in the end I got my business class privileges incl. fast track for security and enjoyed the Miracle, which is a 3rd party, quite disappointing lounge. Lounge provided in SGN (domestic) was the Le Saigonnais, which had good food and (only) soft drinks. Luggage arrived perfectly on both destinations; had to collect it and check it in again in Saigon due to the international arrival from Bangkok to the domestic next flight.<br>On board I found a traditional, ample business class seating. FA-staff were courteous, caring, and very attentive. On both flights I had amble space with pleasant, wide, large seats in a 2 x 2 configuration (4 rows); less than half of the 16 seats were taken. Wet towels provided, likewise welcome drinks. As for food, I got the verbal choice (no menu) of hot and cold snacks and drinks, appropriate for short flights. Asked on both flights if I cared for more food and drinks. Table cloth, steel cutlery and proper glasses were provided. Champagne is not any longer served on regional flights, only wine. The white wine was completely undrinkable: a cheap French sauvignon which is unsellable in Europe, but VN seems pleased to have made a good deal by paying for garbage, feeding their passengers with substandard (toxic?) drinks. 2-4 Vietnamese beers were offered, also on the domestic leg. IFE is on shared monitors with VN inspired programme of agriculture, tourism, and culture. No sound, unless you use own headsets. Call bell answered with seconds. Luggage handled perfectly: without seeing it in Bangkok, they transferred it from the competing Qatar Airways to Saigon, where I had to collect it and recheck it in for domestic onward connection. But nu hassle, and no waiting time apart from walking with it on a trolley from Terminal 1 to 2. Overall, a consistent, classic, boring product with roomy seats."
33,Matthew C,1,"Do not fly with them. Appalling customer service. Paid for baggage online, we had receipts to prove we paid but they made us pay again at the airport. Then once pay for the second time it was an unbelievable hassle to get the luggage checked in. I will never getting an internal flight in Vietnam with them again."
34,Trang N,2,"If you required your customer to fly with a mask, at least have one for those who forgot to carry one"
34,Abovetheclouds,4,"This was better than expected in all honesty. Staff were pleasant and friendly. Planes were clean. Seats were not bad. Comfortable. My screen was not working which was slightly frustrating and I could not watch anything on a 12 hour flight. It wasn't the fault of the staff. I travel a lot and this is like maybe the second time it has happened to me. It was fine and the staff did try to help but a reset did not work. I slept instead! I ordered a special meal gluten free which was good. Even the standard meals glancing at other passengers looked nice, think Asian with noodles and rice. As it is a long flight and we left London at 11:00 local time, we were given lunch just after departing and breakfast the next morning just before landing. In between, you can just ask the staff for snacks like noodles or drinks and they will bring this to you. I liked the fact travelling a lot that they gave you enough time to eat before landing, as most airlines just throw breakfast at you an hour before landing and you have to rush it down you! We were woken up around 2 hours before landing, given a hot towel and were then able to have a nice breakfast. Service was fast. Drinks selection was average but fine. They gave a complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste set and what appeared to be slippers! Online checking in was easy and I was able to book a window seat in advance. Even at the airport, this was quick. Boarding was somewhat chaotic. They called up first and business class, special needs and travellers with children but everyone seemed to just run forward. So we all boarded at the same time. Although we were slightly delayed going out (plus / minus 30 minutes), this was more cargo and things rather than the airline. We landed early so this was fine. Getting off the plane was reasonably quick and luggage was delivered in a timely manner. To be honest, you are only likely to fly them if going to Vietnam or in transit to somewhere like Australia. They were much better than expected."
34,Susanna D,5,"Before booking with them in October, I found it difficult to get in contact with staff on the phone to discuss enquires. However, the 5-star review was given because of their impeccable care and service.<br><br>After changes to the flight time to an earlier 55 minutes, we had missed our transfer as my son and I were still on our Singapore -&gt; Ho Chi Minh flight. Apparently this change was made early in advance but the app I booked the flight on did not state whether it was a delay or earlier.<br><br>We arrived at HCM at 9pm and we missed the last flight of the day, without hesitation they rebooked our flights to suit our needs (it was Dec, super busy and they had no seats left so they booked us with Pacific Airlines), had organised us a hotel stay, transfers to and from hotel, and even made sure the hotel fed us. It was stressful enough as it is travelling with a young son and they made this experience a whole lot easier. Thank you to the late night staff at Vietnam Airlines that were working on the 23rd of Dec ‘22 you all went above and beyond."
34,suko,2,"I had a Vietnam airlines flight from london to manila with 2 layovers in hanoi and ho chi min but the final flight was another airline as per the ticket , anyways in london check in was smooth and staff was friendly and boarded on time the aircraft at the time was a 787-9 (VN56) and was about 12 hours long to hanoi , food and service was pretty average for a long haul flight , the ife (in flight entertainment) barely has any movies or anything to watch plus mid flight the headphone jack of the ife broke and i had to bear with it most of the flight it was an overnight flight too and the passenger behind me was a child and wouldnt stop kicking and screaming but that is nothing i van complain about because you cant really prevent it , but anyways when we reached our first layover the staff there werent very nice and they were rude to us and they stopped us in the airport and made us miss the flight , luckily the next flight was in an hour and we managed to catch up but our luggage was in the first flight so we had to go to the baggage claim and check in the luggage again for the final flight it was smooth but it wasnt vietnam airlines overall my experience was a 4/10 the total travel time was 24 hours and 30 minutes"

35,Pioneer103363,1,"I booked my flight 4 months before travel. Got an email from Vietnam airlines that one of legs on my outbound journey has been  cancelled, about a month after booking. I had booked inbound also on vietnam airlines but through a third party platform. The inbound also had two legs and one of them got moved to a later time which meant I couldn't take the connecting flight and still get to my final destination, while being in compliance with my visa requirement. I needed to get to only the designated airport on the designated date in order to comply with the visa. <br>So I called the third party agency to cancel, and they had to escalate to airline, and even after 7 calls every week, no action has been taken by airline to start refund process.  VA wrote back emails in response to my cancellation request for outbound, and keep stalling asking silly questions like do you need cancellation for one leg or both - feels like delay tactics. They also clearly say any refund is only possible until 3 hours before travel. And I am travelling on 12th Jan 2023. <br>They ask me to call their 'hotline' for speedy service and everytime I called, it goes straight into marketing message selling flights to the Pacific Islands. I have listened to this for an hour without knowing if I am even on the right number. Totally ridiculous"
35,ColoradoTraveler1120,3,"Over the course of our adventure in Vietnam, we took three flights on Vietnam Airlines - HCMC to Danang; Hue to Hanoi; and then Hanoi to Seoul (Incheon) as the first leg of our journey home.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines is a very average airline at best. The international trip (Hanoi to Seoul) was a smoother operation. But these domestic flights left a good deal to be desired.<br><br>Legroom is virtually non-existent. American airlines squeeze the economy rows together. But they do so even tighter in Vietnam. Be prepared to get very familiar with your own knees.<br><br>The real debacle related to our scheduled flight from Hue to Hanoi. It was a day of intense rain in Hue. That is certainly no fault of the the airline, but their response was unimpressive. No planes were able to land in Hue for a number of hours, so clearly there were no outbound flights.<br><br>But the airline's display boards indicated that our flight was ""boarding"" even when it was still stuck in its previous location. Later, those boards falsely, wishfully read ""departed"" as to our flight. Worse, once you go through security at the Hue airport and enter the boarding area (no great shakes), you are cut off from access to any Vietnam Airlines personnel or anyone who might be able to offer information. <br><br>It became apparent to use after three hours of waiting that this flight was not a happening deal. We bailed and went back to the hotel from which we had checked out earlier that afternoon. But Vietnam Airlines waited a full 6.5 hours after flight time to cancel the flight. Most passengers were stuck in that endless limbo without information. <br><br>To top it off, when we bailed and rescheduled for the following day, in reclaiming our luggage, guess what - both suitcases had been sitting outside for three or more hours in the deluge. Everything in them was soaking wet. In a country that gets more than its share of rain, one might think that the national airline would have a better system for managing luggage in a downpour and long flight delay.<br><br>As I said, three stars is probably generous. Be advised."

35,Antoine H,1,"If you are looking for an airlines that will change your flight to the following day without an explanation, look no further. From other reviews I am seing online, it also looks like it is a common practice for this company.<br><br>I booked a flight Tokyo - Hanoi - Paris. For my return (Paris &gt; Hanoi &gt; Tokyo - 18hours), they changed the Hanoi - Tokyo flight to 24 hours later. It appears normal for Vietnam Airlines to let me wait at the airport for that time. No explanations were made, nor any efforts to provide accomodations or any commercial gesture when I reached out to them. Their response? <br><br>""Dear Mr.  We regret to inform you that due to Vietnam Airlines has informed you about schedule change before departure date so we won't compensate in this case.""<br><br>When asking if they can assign me a seat with more legroom in the new flight they assigned me? <br><br>""We regret to inform that the extra legroom seat applies the fee so we can't support to assign for you via the email.

Which would save about 6 hours. What they did not mention or check, is that there was a flight from Hanoi to Tokyo which arrived in Tokyo at the exact same time than what they were suggesting, thus saving this unecessary additinal flight.<br><br>In short, if you use Vietnam Airlines, be prepared to be left figuring things out on your own when they unilateraly change things. Their best response will be that they covered themselves because they warned you enough time in advance, and if you need to make adjustments, pay for it yourself.<br><br>Thanks Vietnam Airlines<br><br>(on a side note, seats are small, foot is ok, entertainment - there are barely any movies available)"
36,Stive R,1,They lost my bagages. And they can’t find it. Wow! You pay an extra to check-in your bag with your name and passport. And they can’t find your bag. Discusting
36,Soko37,3,"Coming early for check in to avoid crowds, surprise that I have 100 people in front of me, tourists from agency. Great that all check in counters were opened and it went pretty efficiently. Check in counter was nice, got exit seat and extra instructions for customs in Indonesia. Next challenge was immigration check. This is pretty messy place as it is organised by immigration police 👮‍♀️ , many people waiting, opening new counters too late reactively, people sprinting to be first. Flight on time, boarding through bus by ground service, all quick. Food very average, banana was better than beef with potatoes 🥔 . Less in meal is better than average big portion.

37,wombatdavid,4,We were connecting from an international flight which arrived late. We got to the domestic terminal and were able to check in at the priority counter with our Delta gold status. That also offered a priority security screening which was a time saver. We had time to visit the Lotus lounge but bear in mind that you can only do this with an international connection and they did ask to see our previous boarding passes.<br><br>The flight left about 30 minutes late due to rain but we arrived only 10 minutes late. You got water on board but no snack - we thought Vietnam were a full service airline? Our priority bags came off fast in Da Nang. <br><br>Overall a good flight for the price paid. We paid a small amount extra for exit row which was worth it.
37,wombatdavid,5,"We travelled premium economy. <br><br>The check in at Frankfurt was fast and we had access to the JAL Sakura lounge as we hold gold status with Delta. That was a lovely lounge. The flight boarded on time but then we sat at the gate for ages and had a long taxi. We took off an hour late. The 2 meal services were great - very tasty. The 787 seat is comfortable and we got some sleep. Also a fantastic flight as there were no kids present. I wish airlines would make kids go in economy only when you pay a lot for premium or business, the last thing you want is someone else’s little darlings screaming for 11 hours! The arrival was ok as it was only 30 minutes late and we made our connection.<br><br>Major disadvantage of Vietnam is poor movie selection. I have 1 more long flight with them in November and have already watched all the movies I want to<br><br>But overall great service and Qantas could learn what service means.<br><br>One of gripe - the foreign currency exchange rates on the duty free and not great at all. I got my plane model but it worked out much more than USD20. The Euro rate was terrible so I used pounds which was not much better. Take USD if you can and want to buy on board."
37,Antonia E,1,We booked a flight from Nha Trang to da nang at 8:30am and had a connecting flight to Bangkok at 12:40pm. A day or two after booking they changed the first flight to 6HOURS later and this was 6 days before the flight. So it completely ruined our itinerary for the day and our visas ran out that day so we had to fly. We then had to get them to change the first flight to the day before and we then had to book another hotel and transport to accommodate it. We get to the flight the day before we fly to Bangkok and they’re boarding a different flight at the time our flight was meant to be boarding with our flight details on the screen. The flights then delayed because they’re boarding this other flight for 30+ minutes when boarding a flight should take a lot less time. The room with the seats is full of people and there’s nowhere to sit because it looked like they overbooked these two flights. Would not recommend if you actually have places to be
37,Puhup_Verma,2,"Check-in : Arrived 3 hours before our departure , just to discover that the dedicated Business Class desk had been converted into some sort of ""Friends &amp; Family of Check-in staff"" desk , who were flying Economy and had no SkyTeam Elite Plus status whatsoever. We patiently waited for a while , before humbly approaching one of the senior lady staff members present. Rather than any resolution , she began ""misleading"" us into believing that the airline has no policy of a separate Business class counter. When I pointed out that the display screen above her clearly said ""BUSINESS CLASS"" , she got 'irritated' and 'ordered' us to join the regular queue. Was left with no option , but to involuntarily follow this 'order' , or waste more time standing there. Once we reached ahead , we noticed MORE Business Class passengers had been turned away just like us.<br>In short , if you're flying out from Delhi , and want priority check-in , just buy an Economy Class ticket , and be friends with one of the staff members present , rather than spending a fortune on Business Class , and waiting in a regular queue.<br><br>Lounge : Plaza Premium Lounge ( Lounges B ) , Level 4<br>This lounge has probably shut down a few days ago , so writing much about it is immaterial. But , a much better experience when compared to our pre-pandemic visits here.<br><br>Boarding : A weird experience yet again. No signage with ""SkyPriority"" anywhere. Bothered to ask one of the staff members present , who too feigned ignorance , and made us line up in a regular queue yet again. Once we were inside the aircraft , we noticed that one of the seats on our boarding passes was different from what we had selected online during web check-in. This should have been communicated to us while we were at the check-in counters , but not surprised at all that they didn't. Some of the other Business Class passengers ( who had done a web check-in as well , and did not bother to check their boarding passes ) were far more baffled , and raised quite a hue &amp; cry.<br><br>Seating / Layout : The A350 has only 1 Business Class cabin with staggered seating. The lie-flat seats were quite comfortable for the short flight to Hanoi. The seat controls worked well.<br><br>Service : The crew was kind &amp; friendly , but their comprehension of English was quite poor. The service between the 2 aisles was quite inconsistent. For comparison - all of us seated on the left were done with our meals ( within an hour of takeoff ) , and hardly 2 or 3 on the right had even got a beverage till then. Even their simple orders for tea / coffee were being forgotten / mixed up , despite multiple reminders. A senior vs. junior crew member(s) ego tussle in the galley was to be blamed , and half of the passengers in our cabin bore the brunt of it.<br><br>Food / Beverages : The lack of menus , and the inability of the crew to clearly explain what exactly was to be served , left a 'surprise' element. An oriental fish preparation was good , but a ""noodle"" dish turned out be tasteless pasta with hard meatballs. The Vietnamese coffee was good as expected.<br><br>Arrival : A separate queue at Immigration for Business Class passengers. Luggage arrived on a priority basis as well."
37,Bruce B,5,Such excellent service in flight. British and American airlines could learn a lot from these people.
38,JawaharJoshi,3,"We took a domestic flight from Hanoi to Da Nang.  They did not serve food complimentary, but at least they served water."
38,wombatdavid,4,We travelled in premium economy on the 787 and much preferred the seat to the Airbus 350. Much more comfortable and spacious. The trip started badly at check in as we were told our entertainment was broken but we could be moved (but seated apart). No thanks in the end they clarified that it was just the remotes not working. But come on do some maintenance! The whole plane was showing its age.<br><br>The in flight service was great and 2 hot meals served. <br><br>Flight was 1 hour late and baggage was slow especially as our priority tagged bags did not come out first.<br><br>So not quite 5 stars but very good.
38,Stickermansister,5,"A comfortable journey with good seats and excellent service from the very professional staff    The food choices were good and we were looked after fir the whole time   The entertainment system works well and the choice is wide   We were kept informed of any slight variation to the times of the journey by email which was appreciated     We travelled to, from and across Vietnam with Vietnam airlines and an excellent service on all journeys with no delays apart from bringing forward our return trip to London by 20 minutes"
38,Sapir T,5,"As someone that doesn't like to take planes, this flight with Vietnam Airlines really surprised me in a good way! From the moment we arrived on the plane it felt safe, clean and professional. Great meal, great entertainment system with nice movies. Will definitely want to fly with them again."
38,Soko37,5,"Rushing back to Ho Chi Minh City in late evening, great it was possible to get earlier flight no matter I already checked in for later one, airline was solving that without any fees. Got exit seat and happy to have room for legs, food was not tasty but stomach was happy. Service nice. Boarding was late but well organised. We were landing in good time"
39,wombatdavid,4,This was our first flight with Vietnam Airlines and overall we are impressed. We flew on the A350 in premium economy and enjoyed the extra legroom in the first row with a 2-4-2 configuration. The service was fast and friendly and the food was amazing. Two hot meal services all served with a wide range of drinks. <br><br>They almost earned 5 stars from me but for the relatively limited movie selection and the tatty seat armrests in a few places. Buy a few more movies and do some cosmetic repairs for an extra star!<br><br>We look forward to our next flight.
39,Vinisha P,5,Everything was perfect. Fast smooth and efficient :) baggage came out faster than me! Thank you so much.
39,Chia,1,My flight was late and was rushing to transit. The Courtesy service lady was extremely rude when I could not print my K-ETA details. Instead of helping she see fit to give a reprimand and a black face and walk away after that. The rest of the staff just set around and do not show a bit of interest in helping. First time to Vietnam and the service leaves a lot to be desired.
39,George K,5,"Very pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of service on all flight sectors, BKK-SGN-PUS and return. New A350 and B787-9 used with ample leg room in economy class. All departures and arrivals were on time. Cabin crew were very proffesional and helpful serving meals and drinks with a smile. Meals were adequate and tasty. A wide selection of in-flight entertainment was offered. I will certainly fly with Vietnam airlines again."
39,RobynL,4,"Premium economy flight was great. Good food ( for an airline) and lovely service. It certainly made for a more comfortable 9 hours being in Premium Economy. Will definitely fly again. Flew home Business and was pleasantly surprised. Comfy, flat beds, good amenities and attentive staff."
40,KM,1,"After a delay to boarding - and no water available to purchase, we then sat on the tarmac for close to an hour due to bad weather. The first 10 minutes were quite turbulent,  but that is not the fault of the airline!<br><br>However, the service on board was very disappointing.  Despite requesting water and being told several times that the drink cart was on its way,  it was 2.5 hours after take off that we were finally served a drink - a small cup of water. Thankfully the steward served me another one! The meal was finally served by they only had the fish option left. It was dry and cold, and the pasta it was served with was like rubber when I tapped it with the fork.<br>I was very hungry by the time breakfast was served,  but again, the scrambled eggs were like cold rubber. <br>The coffee was possibly the worst I have ever tasted on a plane. Luke warm and worse than instant coffee.<br>There were limited options for tv and movies in English, which made the flight seem even longer!<br>We had fabulous experiences with our flight from Sydney to Vietnam and our 2 internal flights.  However,  this flight was very disappointing ."
40,Alejandra C,1,"We booked a last minute ticket to Vietnam from Thailand and I had a problem with my visa. While we had two hours before the flight, we asked for help several times at the counter to change our flight even if fees might apply. The answer we got is that we need to send an email and they were not able to do anything at the airport. I understand there are some process to follow but bureaucracy is the first name of this airline. The lack of empathy we have experienced within the airport, customer service and website is just out of this world."
40,Felix L,5,"Non stop, 2 hour flight, fully convertible flat-bed seats in 787 Dreamliner, not very common for a short, domestic flight. Nice business lounge on Hanoi."
40,Nick D,1,"Absolutely horrible experience with this airline. Caused me so much trouble - at one stage trying to block me from getting on a connecting flight to Australia because they insisted I needed a visa (I am a New Zealander, and so do not). I had to rebook a number of flights with them, and they charged me multiple no-show fees on the original flights. I'd never fly with them again."
40,luvcafe,4,"It's a new route and direct flight from San Francisco, USA to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Overall, it's great. Staffs on the flight were polite. Foods were ok (it's ready box foods so I didn't expect much). Economy seat - just like any other airlines (eg. Cathy Pacific, Eva, Air New Zealand,  etc...). Airbus 350 - configuration: 3 -3 -3. The walk way is a little tight. People have roller carryon seem to have difficulty pulling it. I had a package so couldn't tell much. <br><br>Check in: SFO check in took long. Very long line and took me 1.5 hours until I was able to check in (not allow online check in). They opened counter 3 hours before the flight scheduled. I arrived SFO 3.5 hours before the flight so I had to wait and plenty of people were in line already.<br><br>Check in: TSN (Ho Chi Minh), I went there early and they didn't open check in counter until 3 hours before the flight scheduled. <br><br>Leaving SFO or TSN both delayed; however, flights still arrived on-time. I think they already factored delay time in. <br><br>Overall: I don't mind to fly with Vietnam airline again especially this route. No connection, just straight 16 hours from SFO to TSN and about 13.5 hours from TSN to SFO. <br><br>Note: if the flight isn't full and there are empty seats, staffs were very nice. They offered elderly to move to empty seat so they can lay down. This is a Vietnamese airline, staffs speak Vietnamese and English."
41,Britt,1,"Unfortunately my enjoyable experience with the actual flights was ruined by a staff members customer service. When my partner and I flew from London to Sydney, we had a stopover in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Prior to the flight, I researched whether we needed a visa to transit through Vietnam and I found that as we didn’t plan to leave the airports, we didn’t need a visa. We, as well as 5 other Australians, were stopped at Hanoi and told we needed a visa. All of us Australians were shocked as we were all told we didn’t need one. We put our passports in to get a visa and as we were waiting, an extremely rude Vietnam airlines staff member came over and told us we needed visas repeatedly and told us to pay her right now while threatening us that we would be sent back to London.<br><br>All of the Australians were confused but cooperating but this Vietnam airlines staff member was using a belittling tone while threatening us. We repeatedly asked her how much the visa was and she kept coming back with different prices. She said that they would only accept cash and said it was $25 USD each. She said she would accept British pound but wouldn’t accept Scottish Pound which is the same thing, despite that being all we had. She kept claiming British pound and American dollar was the same despite the difference in the currency. Despite there being a Government sign present saying that a transiting visa was only $5 USD, she quietly denied that we could have that visa and again threatened that if we didn’t give her $25 USD then we would be sent back.<br><br>The whole experience was extremely upsetting and scary as my partner and I had just moved back from London, we were low in money, had no Vietnamese dong or any access to internet while being yelled at in a foreign country. All of the Australians agreed that we felt like we had been scammed and were very uneasy due to the staff members attitude.<br><br>When we then entered Ho Chi Minh City, the same Australians were stopped at the airport as well as us with no explanation as the airport security took pictures of the visa and then we were finally told there was an issue with the visa we were given. The whole experience was horrific and I will not be flying with Vietnamese Airlines nor will I visit Vietnam again!!"
41,white100,4,"Nice Dreamliner 787/900 and a good flight technically. They have old fashioned head sets which are uncomfortable after a while. surprised no noise cancelling in 2022.  On a 13 hour flight you need entertaining and the choice of entertainment was not so good. Same on the way back after 3 weeks., The food was quite basic.  The cabin crew were very nice, friendly, polite and helpful. They did struggle with English. The lay flat seats were quite hard and compared to other 787's I have flown on were not as comfortable. I have the need for a wheelchair at the airports and they were just great at both Ho Chi Minh and Heathrow. Would I use them again, without a doubt."
41,Nguyen N,1,"Vietnam Airlines is not at all a budget airlines and indeed a national airlines. However, when I checked in at Changi, the ground staff asked me to buy one piece of luggage at 128 SGD saying that my ticket does have luggage allowance. I can’t believe it. Just line when you buy insurance, you have to read all small prints in the policy. you need to do the same when you buy tickets with Vietnam Airlines. I will never fly by Vietnam Airlines any more. Cheating."
41,Nick H,1,- poor sanitation <br>- customer service even worse <br>- would not consider even if I’m on a budget <br>- good luck with choosing Vietnam airline ;)
41,Le t,1,I had another bad mood for traveling with vietnamairline again. I may need to align my schedule to go with Bambooairways next time. Hopefully more Bamboo flights frequency to HAN in the future
42,HRH-Siva,5,Impressed by the service of the airline. The A321 from SIN to SGN was well maintained and comfortable. I pre ordered the Hindu Meal and the meal was tasty and the portion was good. The airline was sweet to offer mooncake as it was during the moon cake festival.
42,Qulcia,1,"My reservation was cancelled, as a reason they said it's due to schedule change, which is a lie! The flight is still planned, they are selling tickets but the prices are significantly higher! This is outrageous! I'm a frequent flyer, but something like that has never ever happened to me. I'm super disappointed as I've been waiting for these after COVID vacations. I will never fly with Vietnam Airlines, and I will be telling my story to all my friends."
42,Chloe C,2,We booked a flight to and from Saigon to Dalat. Both ways has delayed twice! Each time is 40 mins interval. Flight attendant are nice and courteous. The reason why I book with Vietnam airline is to minimize the delayed time. Instead of booking Viet Jet or Bamboo which is much cheaper but we go with Vietnam airlines is to hopefully get on our way ON TIME but sadly we got delayed as well. Not sure if I will fly with this airlines again.
42,Claire W,1,Flight was delayed for 3 hours and I missed my connecting flight back home to Sydney. There’s nothing they can do about it. I wish I took the bus instead. They are not very reliable
42,Damian,1,"Scammed us out of our premium economy flight tickets during the pandemic. An expenditure of almost 3.000 euro. We accepted their vouchers because the country closed during the pandemic, and now it's open again they give us an invalid excuse as to why we cannot use their vouchers anymore.<br><br>Bad service. Bad customer support. Absolutely doesn't deserve the SKYTRAX rating it has."
43,Alexa Duran,1,"Round trip bkk hanoi - hanoi bkk <br><br>Worst airline, <br><br>First time from bkk to hanoi VN 610 i gave them a benefit of the doubt, flight crew was kinda rude but i didnt say anything. We were about to land to hanoi ans they still haven't gotten the food trays. <br><br>Flight back to bkk from hanoi, VN 613 boarding the lady ask me where's my mask , so i said oh ok it's needed? Because all the white people ahead of me didn't have a mask on and she didnt say anything about it. I felt discriminated at that point. Avoid this airline, no service at all. <br><br>Oh and the ""food"" .. jeez"
43,Rosemary M,1,The booking was my problem they issued the tickets with my name twice instead of 2nd passenger and after much hassle informed me I had to pay $110 to correct their error.The original flight was cancelled and they rebooked it for the next day which was impossible for us and wouldn’t refund the one flight which if you cancelled would lose the whole flight.<br>Will never use them again and they charge a lot
43,SOPHIE T,1,"I were purchasing 2 trips and got delayed both.<br>Price always more expensive than any Carriers.<br>Bought from Vietnam airline website but operate with Pacific Airlines, we didnot get notice for this, so we had to walk 15 mins from Vietnam Airline counter to Pacific counter with 2 kids and 6 luggages. Will never fly with Vietnam Airline again"
43,sasha,1,"Extremely disappointed doesn’t cover it. My family and I were one of the first people to check in for the plane flying from Da Nang to Saigon and the onto Melbourne. To begin, it took the flight attendant over an hour to check in 4 pieces of underweight luggage. We then made it clear to her that due to my child’s illness which is triggered and exacerbated by sleep deprivation (leading to seizures), that it was necessary to sit somewhere quieter. We were guaranteed seats near the front of the plane, with one of them being a window seat.<br><br>Not only did the attendant get the plane the plane configuration wrong, she also told us we could change our seating when arriving in Saigon. Our flight was then delayed nearly two hours at Da Nang, leading to us nearly missing our connecting flight to Melbourne. We were then told that due to the delay the airline would help us through customs and onto the next plane. Once arriving in Saigon we were provided with no information and dropped at customs with no insight as to were to go or what gate we are supposed to be at.<br><br>Our flight out of Saigon to Melbourne was delayed. Once we reached the gate we tried to confirm our seats at the gate and we were immediately shut down and told that we were wrong and needed to confirm our seats in Da Nang even though we were told the opposite.<br><br>Once on the plane we realised our seats where at the very back of the plane next to the toilets. We then proceeded to talk to the staff, with the sole purpose of only trying to get my child moved so she could sleep, so here illness wouldn't be exacerbated. We were treated with hostility and provided with no solution.<br><br>We were told that there was nothing they could do except get a representative to meet us in Melbourne when we landed. Once again the airline disappointed we were met with no representative and nothing was resolved.<br><br>Suffice to say for the price payed I’m extremely disappointed and don’t recommend this airline to any prospective customers. Further I would seriously recommend to the airline that many systematic issues are present and needed immediate attention."
43,Anh,1,"This airline business is a joke. I wanted to book for my pets reservations for the long haul. I literally tried every single way to be in contact with them, but all left with disappointed. It's impossible to reach to their customer service, all they said was just repeated messages, which kept saying ""please contact to our service for the special service"". This would be the last time I had ever been to this brand."
44,Riza A,5,"I was throughly impressed by the Vietnam Airlines crew. I had a tight window between my flight from Hue to HCM and my flight to KL (with a different airline). The crew in Hue and HCM went above and beyond to make sure I can still make my flight, despite the delay due to bad weather. At multiple points, they assigned ground staffs to help me get to the international departure terminal, they even helped get my boarding passes for my continuing flights. They also assigned front seat with super wide legroom so I can exit the plane early. Overall, amazing service and hospitality!"
44,Rich E,1,"booked 2 seats on this flight, was charged for 4! customer service completely uncontactable! They just stole my money! spent so much time and money on the phone with no one answering."
44,Elena,3,"My family/relatives went on a trip from HCMC to Phu Quoc for a fun vacay trip. Tickets were all booked, all payed and confirmed. These 2 ppl wanted to purchase tickets after us though the aircraft was fully booked, shockingly the tickets that were sold to us and our seats were given to them, just because they are known to the aircraft employee two of my family members have to move to another aircraft. Not only that, service were poor and non-existence, our flight was only a little over 30 mins, therefore no food wasn’t that big of a deal, though drinks aren’t even serves unless you asked. Absolutely Horrific and sickening."

44,Anders P P,4,"Flew on A321 SGN-HUE on 23 June 2022. Check-in took 2 Minutes. As Sky Priority, I was given fast track, VIP bus, and excess luggage, but denied lounge access as a gold card on Skyteam is insufficient apart from VN-airlines own FFP (Lotus). 15 Minutes delays on a busy afternoon is not bad. Onboard, no IFE, only a paper towel and water is served. Clean aircraft. Good flight announcements. Beautiful rainbow scenery on the way to Hue. Bus-gatings are anti-climax on an otherwise fine trip. In Hue, one is not even allowed to walk 40 meters from aircraft to arrivals, what a waste of bus-resources and people’s time. Luggage delivered perfectly. The 65 USD paid is worth it."
45,Charleston Volo,5,"The flight from Ho chi minh to Tuy Hoa was very comfortable. Costumer service are very good and was helpful with the baggage information before departure. Much baggage included with the air ticket. Great crew onboard as well, will recommend to fly with Vietnam Airlines."
45,john m,5,"We flew in Premium Economy, the service was just amazing <br>seats were very comfy, and food was nice. Boeing 787/9 was the plane <br>we flew in  Feb 2020 so ignore below"
45,Chloe F,1,"Extremely disappointing. Was only notified of the departure timing change (1 hour delay) at the airport.<br><br>The very reason we decided to pay a premium price for Vietnam airlines over vietjet was to avoid flight delays.<br><br>Furthermore, when enquiring the airline staffs, the delay was simply repeated in a matter of fact way. The staff also claim that emails have been sent to us. We showed them our emails to proof that no emails have been received. And afterwards, they just again repeated “the flight is now 3pm”.<br><br>Horrible flight planning, horrible customer service. Take with caution."
45,Darina O,5,"Excellent customer service, we were able to change our flights to later in the day with no charges and no hassle. Couldn't do it online so the airline organised it over email. All smooth and on time, can't recommend enough."
45,Darina O,5,"Excellent airline, comfortable and spacious seats in economy, with in-flight entertainment and refreshments even on a very short flight. Check in and flight staff were all lovely. Very enjoyable journey, would certainly travel with them again."
46,Ngo,1,"They changed our flights, messed up the flight schedule and they didn't response to our emails until we had to call their hotline (several times). Finally, we ended up paying 100 eu more as we called them from abroad <br>It was such a waste of money."
46,Michael Margolin Travel Associates Coy,3,Delayed 2 hours for a 1 hour flight ..... apparently the norm for VN to consolidate pax to fill planes.
46,whiteswordfish,1,"My luggage has been stolen by the people who works for this airline. I’ve been following up with receipt of my check-in luggage for 3 weeks but they can’t find it and they don’t care to find it. My luggage doesn’t have any expensive items, just regular stuffs (clothes, shoes). People who work here are so separate. The management sucks. This is the only airline that flys directly to Vietnam, so they can do whatever they want, including stealing.<br>Avoid at all cost. Not worth your headache and money."
46,Elizabeth Q,4,"This was my first experience of Vietnam Airlines for 2.5 years. They are still not fully back to normal, especially with only one flight a week between the UK and Hanoi, they really need to resume their regular schedule. The flight left from Terminal 2 instead of the usual 4 and the Business Lounge was comfortable and well stocked .The flight was late leaving as they were waiting for connecting flights. Drinks were served before take off including a sparkling wine which I doubt was champagne. There was no food menu &amp; I was asked to choose between chicken &amp; potato or beef &amp; potato - neither of which sounded particularly appetizing! I chose beef &amp; when it came it was fillet steak with vegetables &amp; was delicious. They need to improve their marketing skills! The wine was absolutely first class too &amp; I enjoyed several glasses. Food was offered frequently throughout the flight. The cabin wasn't even half full and the flight was peaceful and comfortable."
46,moont46,1,"they cancelled our flights like 2 weeks before departure due to ""operational reasons"". sent an email that said that ticket is no longer valid and refund will be given but when i emailed them at least 10x and they dont give a valid answer about the refund. Called their hotline +84 24 38320320 at least 10x and no one actually picks up the call no matter what time i call! now i dont know which flight i can book and whether i can get a refund from vietnam airlines if i book with another airline. <br><br>advice: buy the tickets and pray that there is not flight cancellation/changes. because they are a non-refundable and non contactable airline!!!"
47,Han L,1,"My brother who was stuck in Canada for almost 2.5 years was finally flying home to Viet Nam to see my parents a month ago. He had an overnight layover in South Korea. The next morning when he went to board the plane to Viet Nam, he got rejected because they said his PRC test wasn’t valid anymore. He was stuck here with very little help as the staff at the airport wasn’t sure what to do. We were told he would have to fly back to Canada (nightmare #1), then we would need to contact the Vietnamese Embassy (nightmare #2). When we finally got a hold of the Vietnamese Embassy, they said they wouldn’t be able to do anything, we would have to contact Vietnam Airlines in Viet Nam (nightmare #3). My dad was literally bawling his eyes out to them but they just said there was nothing they could do. Wait, have I mentioned my brother is 17 years old!!!!! He was stuck there for 3 days without the help of Vietnam Airlines which was a huge disappointment, considering he is underage as well. We finally managed to get him another PCR test which was outside of the airport (you would need a visa to get out of the airport - nightmare #4) with a letter from the Vietnamese Embassy and some really kind kind staff there. He also ran out of cash and had no credit cards lol (nightmare #5). <br><br>Anyways, I am honestly very very disasppointed in how Vietnam Airlines had dealt with our situation. My parents are livid. I mean, he is 17!!! I do understand there are rules and protocols you have to follow but the least you could do is OFFER ASSISTANCE. Not just say there is nothing we can do to help. Aren’t you supposed to be helping Vietnamese people, especially kids, get home during this strange time?"
47,Zoë S,1,Wasted hours on the phone trying to get a refund I was promised. Awful airline. My advice if theres an issue with your flight - give up on your money!
47,Steve L,1,"need to ask information about traveling on visitor visa and if the airline require 2way ticket or not. The operator not only denied to have any information about that but also show incorporate attitude and totally deny to help attitude. If you dont want to help, please quit the job as help-desk position, please consider changing your position and not wasting people time!"
47,Sertx28,1,I have been asking for a refund for months a year after my flight was cancelled due to Covid.<br>They have a million excuses not to give refunds. <br>They just keep your money. <br>AVOID!!!
47,Tokuo Fukuichi,5,Such an excellent airline! Definitely recommend it! Would love to fly with Vietnam Airlines again! ❤️🇻🇳
48,Allen T,5,Service was excellent.  food was above average.  Make sure you have your paperwork ready at check in or it will be a disaster.  Biz Class.  4.5 hour flight.  Seats were comfortable.
48,Rebecca,1,"Please please please do not travel with Vietnam Airline ever! This is the worst airline I've ever seen. I didn't get any notice of cancellation until I checked with them. And they promised to refund immediately, after 3 weeks they said they need two more months to refund. Why did they keep lied to me before? Every time I called them I got a reply ""We are processing your refund today"".  But nothing happened at all. I really need to money back right now but I can do nothing. I'm pretty sure they just wanna hold your money to pay their bills. Trash Airline. Shame on it."
48,Mi B,1,"terrible, sorry airlines. if you dont care about money this is the airlines for you since you can just give them your wallet."
48,Mi B,1,"It was swift and easy when they take your money but post-purchase service is horrible, terrible, they would test your patience to the max. they changed my flight schedule - which was fine,and as I chose for refund in voucher form, this is where the issue began. it has been taking me27  days (and still counting)  and countless phone calls and emails, we are talking 2 digits here.. for them to finally refund the booking in voucher form PART BY PART, so it took me 10+ emails and calls to get a refund for 1 passenger, and then another round of equal efforts for another passenger, until this point it has been 1 month and they still have not refunded me completely yet. ""Online support Dept"" seems to have a tiny team of 1-2 persons or they are just not in the mood for working. Your emails will confirm go to the universe's black hole. Speechless, waste of my time. never again."
48,Dao P,1,"It was my first time booking this brand flight ticket for my journey to Phu Quoc island via the Traveloka site. <br>I did pay the returned tickets with discounted prices of 1,300,000 VND like the advertisements on 15/4/2021 with the expected schedule as follows:<br>+ 6/5/2021 depart at 6:10 AM from HCM city to Phu Quoc<br>+ 8/5/2021 depart at 19:30 PM from PQ to HCM city<br><br>I booked all accommodations and related tours in this period already after done the fights. Then they changed the fights schedule by themselves without any customers awareness:<br><br>- 30/4/2021: on this night holiday they sent message by Traveloka to change time as follows:<br>    +  6/5/2021 depart at 06:55 AM : I had to think about rush hour once I arrived as I booked one tour which bus would pick us at 9AM but it may be acceptable<br>    +  8/5/2021 depart at 16:20 PM: I couldn't accept this time as I booked the tour which ended at 6PM, it took 15 mins to get to the airport as well. So I sent a message to Traveloka to change the time as I couldn't make it then they accepted to ask Vietnam Airlines to change the flight for me to depart at 21:40 PM<br><br>- 5/5/2021: things were thought ok but they kept sending me the message to change flights again:<br>    +  6/5/2021 depart at 09:15 AM: I was so upset this time that I couldn't make my first tour and had to call the agent to move the tour to the next day as obviously VA Airlines couldn't accept to change to other sooner flight. Fortunately, I left one vacant day on 7/5 then I asked them to move the 6/5 tour to 7/5 and they accepted.<br>    +  8/5/2021 still depart at 21:40 PM: I still hope no change for this final flight. But NO<br><br>- 7/5/2021: while I was on vacation at the hotel and in the middle of the night Traveloka sent a message at 1:27 AM to say it changed the final flight:<br>    +  8/5/2021 still depart at 17:25 PM: I was really furious as I absolutely couldn't make it with the last tour ended at 6 PM. I sent Traveloka a message to refund me or change the schedule but they did not reply to me and told me it was Vietnam Airlines' decision to change customer flights every time with different plane codes. I did try to call the support line of this fight but they ended up with no one to pick the phone call after several minutes to wait for leading instructions. My journey was shattered by depression of how to get back to Ho Chi Minh city my home. <br>They literally did not send a reply besides saying sorry with no help from Traveloka and VN Airlines. They kept answering me that the different time was less than 4 hours (they defined themselves with no advanced agreement) then they refused to refund me this flight<br><br>- 8/5/2021: in the middle of night 00:12 I received Traveloka message to change the flight <br>     +  8/5/2021 depart at 09:15 AM: I absolutely lost my returned ticket. And I found out it was over 4 hours difference so I decided to send Traveloka message to tell me them to refund me but they called me in the morning and said as a certain truth that their system only recorded the flight changed to 17:25 PM (WTF!!???) though I had sent them message and email sent by them. So far they have been sent no reply to my refunding command<br><br>I urge all of you reading this review that you SHOULD NOT BOOK their flights as they have NO SUPPORT with fake hot lines to pick pocket your phone charges. <br>That is how I robbed my money ticket  (650,000VND) and until now they did not reply to refund me the last flight."
49,clear.simple98@gmail.com,1,"I bought ticket departure may 2020, from budget air.com The flight canceled by airlines, the agent told me to wait be patient, they are working hard to get refund because the flight is canceled. After waiting for a year with the same answer. They emailed me that the airlines refused to refund, the only solution reroute. <br><br>This is how vietnanese doing business, scammer. <br>How we are going to reroute if there is restricrion for foreigner to visit the country? <br><br>I asked for travel voucher, still no answer!!! <br><br>Better don't booked with budget air. Com and Vietnam airlines"
49,Xuan Viet Ho,1,"The flight was delayed for more than three hours, they even let passengers on board, prepare everything then suddenly told that the flight was delayed half an hour for technical issues. Then we waited more than an hour in the plane then they told we have to change the plane. Garbage airline and a shame for a national airlines.<br>And the staff were helpless."
49,e S,1,"My orginally flight was at 2 pm and they changed to 3:15 pm.They made me sit in the airplane for a hour then asked everybody to leave for another flight due to technical issue without an official apology. Honestly they are getting worse and worse while their tickets are higher than Vietjet. To avoid the pains, dont fly with the shty VietNam airline."
49,hoeferma10,1,"We are still waiting for the refund of the flight from Frankfurt to Hanoi , which could not be occured of „COVID 19“ We tried to geht in contact with Vietnam Airlines, but nothing happened !!! We are so disappointed, because it was a lot of money for us.<br>After several telefon calls from a friend of us in Hanoi, they promissed us to send the money back within 30 days but we are still waiting.<br>It is such a shame !!!<br>We wrote many @mails to Vietnam Airlines, but always „return to Sender“"
49,Duy Vu,1,"They wouldn't refund my flight even tho there is a resurgence of covid in saigon. Typical Vietnamese scammers. Vietnam easily has the worst customer service of all countries I've been to. It's practically nonexistent here.  Always think twice before buying anything here. Once they have your money, they dgaf."
50,Fanny Birner,1,"We tried to cancel our flights due to the recent COVID outbreak, and we extra booked the refundable tickets. Vietnam airline did not even pick up their “24/7” service center. We called more than dozens of times each day, and all lines are busy; and we sent refund applications multiple times also got no answer. We went to the office just to get sent to another address. Finally, we passed the day we were supposed to fly. We are so pissed!!! What a scam!!!! Please rethink booking from them, because you never know if you have to cancel your flight. Dealing with them is such a waste of time and guarantees you won’t get your money back. Never again we even think to fly with this airline!!!"
50,Jaime Gómez,1,We have been cheated by this Airline. Our flights were cancelled last match and since then WE have tried to get our money back. They just mail you with the message everything IS Ok and money has been transferred but its totally false. Please beware Vietnam Airlines.
50,Terrie,1,"Please be careful with these airlines. Basically I bought my flight tickets from Vietnam airlines but I ended up getting Pacific airlines ticket (Vietnam airlines bought Jetstar and changed their name to Pacific). They decided to cancel my flight last minute without informing me. They didn't want to help me to sort out my ticket so they made me run back and ford four times from lobby B (Vietnam airlines) to lobby E (Pacific airlines) for about two hours. <br>The staffs were super rude and didn't wear any masks. You can see in the photo down below (three of them didn't wear any mask). Even the baby in the photo could wear a mask but these adults here spreading out virus to the passengers and our community!<br>They canceled my ticket without informing me and made me pay extra 3,632,000 VND ($160) more for a new one way ticket from Hanoi to Saigon. This is super ridiculous. You canceled my ticket; You didn't want to refund me any money; Then you made me pay 3,632,000 VND even I had already paid for my other ticket. So I ended up paying about 5,000,000 VND for a ticket that includes three of your staffs didn't wear any mask spitting saliva on my face?<br>When I said I want to talk to the manager of the airline directly they tried to stop me. Why? What are you scared of? Shouldn't call yourself 4 stars airlines when you can't inform the customer that you cancel their tickets/ no refund/ no new tickets/ ridiculous rip off extra fee. <br>#antipacificairlines<br>#vietnamairlines<br>#taychayvietnamairlines<br> #antivietnamairlines #pacificairlinescoronavirus #vietnamairlinescoronavirus"
50,Rob Mundy,1,I was due to travel from the UK to Cambodia with Vietnam Airlines in November. Due the the Covid 19 situation our flights were cancelled in Mid October. I have tried on many occasions to request and receive a refund for Travel that was not supplied. All I ever get is the same automated email. I have even filled in the refund request form on the website. Guess what? No reply. And now my booking number isn't even recognised on the website either. If I need to talk to anybody I have to call Vietnam from the UK. Even though they have an office based in London. They tell me I have tondwal with them in Vietnam because I booked tickets online through th website.  Shocking as it's cost £3 per minute to call them. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. All the other companies I have dealt with due to Covid  travel issues have sorted out refunds with 7 days!! They obviously don't care about the customers who have parted with their hard earned cash.. I will never use this company again. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE..OR COVID!
50,Roger M,1,Still waiting for refund for cancellation of flight on 25th March due to covid  Airline  cancelled all flights to Uk on 23rd March without any prior warning or correspondence.We has to get flight via Emirates on 22ndto get out of Vietnam before borders closed.They offered taxes  back as they said we were no shows for flights.Flights that weren’t happening.Pleasedo the right thing and refund fares.
51,Guillaume D,1,"Dishonest company into the current context, trying to find any way not to reimburse the tickets. Totally unacceptable and revealing a company mindset that should push anybody to switch to other at least as much efficient (and much cheaper) companies in Vietnam: from Bamboo to VietJet."
51,Sia F,1,If I can give a 0 I will give a 0 100%. Don't Book anything from them EVER! All their service numbers are scams! there is no working service number and I still have not received my refund from July!! I have been waiting for almost 5 month. The flight was canceled right after I made the refund request. I dont see a reason that why the money went into a flight that never takes off can be taking that long to be returned.
51,Thu Hang Tran,1,"CARELESS is the work to describe! <br><br>I flew HCM - HN. I had my camera tripod with me and a suit case to check in as checked luggage. <br><br>Everything was okay until the agent asked me to put my luggage on the belt and I mentioned I had a camera tripod. She looked at her colleague in the next counter and asked if it should be a carry on or a checked luggage??? I mentioned I know I have to check it in every time. She then asked me to pay for the tripod. To my surprise since I flew VNA many times with my tripod and no one ever asked me to pay. Okay, I admit that I was not aware of the new policy. But hey, I don’t work for VNA, do I? Instead of explaining me the changes she then kept showing me on the system and repeatedly told me it said only 1 luggage included. Frankly, I don’t care what’s on your system. What’s important here is how the information was communicated to me in my confirmation/ booking or what’s the solution/ options you could offer to help? Plus, when I mentioned I never got charged she asked me: «&nbsp;Which airlines did you fly? How long have you been flying with VNA?&nbsp;» WOW.. That just hurts! Was it because I dressed casually and looked tired after a long day so I’m that kind of person who can not afford flying VNA??? I told her I’ve been member for 4 yrs let alone I flew before without being a member. She went on and said she’s also worked for 3 yrs and that policy has never changed! If I wanted to send my tripod too then I should ask permission from VNA representatives. I thought to myself: Am I in a VNA loyalty competition with her? I gave up, I told her just check my suitcase in.  She did that and gave me back the ticket, then told me to go to the end of check in counter to wait for my luggage security check. She didn’t even care how I would handle my tripod which she NOW knows that can not be a carry on. And I tell you it was a quiet night at the airport. She didn’t have many guests queuing for checking in. If I were someone who does not think throughout then I would have head to the airplane with it and imagine security would stop me and force me to go back to counter. Not to mention if it was a busy day, this may cost me the flight! I then asked her to direct me to VNA Representatives who was a little better in explaining me the policy and gave me the option to wrap my tripod and luggage as 1pc. Although his first reaction was pretty much the same like hers. <br><br>Long story short, I just can’t believe a senior clerk who worked for VNA for 3 yrs, could not handle the small issue professionally and respectfully. She does not have good knowledge of her company’s policy and no customers service at all. What thought this could give me of her fellow colleagues and VNA in general- which is proudly called national airlines, not to mention to foreigners. It totally shattered my confidence and support for VNA. <br><br>I also know I can’t compare between countries and airlines but I’ve never been treated like this even with budget airlines in US/ Japan/ Singapore...They always keep my tripod in a designated area with other special equipments, handled with care, not just throw in with all of other luggage.<br><br>If only she could have said to me: «&nbsp;I’m sorry but unfortunately our policy has been changed since 1st January 2020 that we count luggage pc instead of kg. I believe the information is stated in your confirmation&nbsp;» There, I would of course check again my confirmation, see in the detailed pdf file that very small line «&nbsp;baggage allowance&nbsp;» and be satisfied to pay the extra fee for my tripod. Everyone would be happy. Instead of that, I was sitting on a 2hr plane ride, thinking about this experience and worrying about my tripod if it would be safely handled. <br><br>I’m very sorry for you that this is a long feedback and I don’t want to talk about this experience I had with a single individual. However, as you know if you work for a national company and have direct interaction with your customers, your image represents the whole brand’s VALUE.<br><br>Moreover, I don’t even think she wore a mask!!!! &amp; the airlines representative for sure didn’t! Given the fact of what is happening now with COVID-19, I don’t think I have to tell you how wrong this is."
51,Matthew,1,Still waiting for a refund from a flight THAT THIS AIRLINE CANCELLED six months ago! Don't trust them with your money.  I've tried to contact them multiple times. They are not keeping us updated about the refund. If they even tried to explain or let us know it is still on the way I wouldn't care. But since they are just hoping that we forget I am furious. Will NEVER EVER EVER BUY A TICKET FROM THIS AIRLINE AGAIN.
51,Ian W,1,"Vietnam Airlines flight booked for 24 June 2020 was twice changed by airline, including changing the date, and then completely cancelled. Vietnam Airlines initially offered about half of fee paid. I reluctantly accepted this offer, but now the airline just refuses to respond to emails asking for an update. Relatively small amount of money involved, but it is the principle. I cannot recommend Vietnam Airlines based upon this service."
52,SimundoW,1,"I've been waiting since March 2020 for my refund.  Filled in the refund form, had a number of reasonable exchanges with the online support people...and then all communication stopped.  Have been trying for months to get some assistance.  Just appalling."
52,Vegrex,1,Scumbag company that refuses to refund money for flights and ignores any attempt to get in contact with them!
52,Lee T,1,"I am aware it is a hard time for these companies -but they promised refunds on what I was legally entitled to be refunded.  THey kepts saying wait three months, but 5 months on and they ignore emails and will not respond.  They seem to think if they wait long enough people will forget and they will steal all that money - it must add up as I see I am not alone and countless people have been treated the same by them. WHy would I ever fly with them?  If they are that dishonest how can you trust them with your lives in the future?"
52,Vince N,5,"Vietnam Airlines has improved over the years. Their boeing dreamliner is amazing. The seats and walkways are clean. Customer service is excellent. I did not have this experience with them before, so that's why I said they have been improved! I flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City twice in December 2019 and also March 2020. Both international trips were awesome. Thank you Vietnam Airlines! In addition, I have been travelling with Vietnam Airlines domestically, and I will continue to do that. They are truly a 4 star service. They will eventually get to 5 soon!"
52,Nick P,5,"I flew Vietnam Airlines several times, from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh and then all around Vietnam. The staff were all very polite and friendly, and the rides were all comfortable. We even had a disastrous occasion where we forgot one of our bags and didn't realize until we got to the plane, and everyone (including the pilot!) was extremely understanding and made sure everything eventually worked out.<br><br>There was some difficulty in making arrangements to travel with my cat. The rules in each city were different (sometimes a checkup was required, sometimes not) and in Ho Chi Minh I was told several times to go to locations to see a veterinarian only to see that they had long since been abandoned. Hopefully they will improve this area of their service, as it was truly the only negative part of flying with them.<br><br>Overall I'd highly recommend Vietnam Airlines for travel within Vietnam or abroad."
53,Caitlyn,1,"I booked my flight from London to Sydney for 21/7/20, with a short stopover in Hanoi. The second leg of my flight from Hanoi to Sydney was cancelled due to Covid-19 so under EU law I am entitled to a full cash refund within 7 days. I emailed Vietnam Airlines who eventually replied and agreed to give me a full cash refund for both legs of my flight. <br><br>It is now 11 weeks after this and I have still not received my refund. Not only this, I have emailed them several times and have been ignored. This is absolutely unacceptable service and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone as a result. Will not be flying with them again. At this point, with my initial flight due to take off tomorrow, I find it ridiculous that they are still holding onto my money. It’s daylight robbery!"
53,evippsr,1,"This is an update on my Complaint Review on Tickets Refund I posted in May here. <br>After 4 months of waiting, several follow ups, and a Complaint review on Trip Advisor, I finally got my refund few days ago (worth USD470). Better late than never VA."
53,eamesescape,5,"I flew economy Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City return night flight. Very happy and a pleasant flight. Had a row of seats to myself. The A380 cabin was clean and did not look to be very old at all. Range of entertainment options was great. 2 meals served and had vegetarian which were both fine. Plenty of water offered and the crew were polite and professional. There were hot towels and blankets and pillows! When I fly with Vietnam Airlines I am always able to sleep during the flight. And arrive refreshed at my destination.! The food and crew were amazing. Overall a great way to fly. Flight time: 8 hours, 50 minutes"
53,omega132857,3,"We were only on the plane for a short flight. One hour fifteen minutes.cthere is not alot to say. You get water or orange juice. There is no food, but that said, who would want food on such a short flight."
53,Eleonore J,1,"We arrived at Heathrow airport to travel to Sydney via Vietnam on the 18th of March 2020. There was already an issue when we arrived, as travellers were being turned away in the line in front of us. The counters were cordoned off and there were Vietnam Airline staff, airport staff and police stationed at the entrance to that section. We learnt that Vietnam Airlines were refusing to on-board anyone who was not a Vietnam National, due to Covid-19. Despite having Australian passports a visa for Vietnam and a connecting flight to Sydney, we were not permitted to board. There was no-one stationed at the Vietnam Airlines Support counter either at anytime. We phoned, emailed, messaged our travel agent numerous times and also phoned Vietnamese Airlines a dozen times without being able to speak to anybody. <br><br>We had splurged out and purchased business class tickets for our return to Australia. We were eventually able to secure economy tickets from another airline to fly home via Singapore. Since our return we have sent numerous emails.  Our travel agent informs us that Vietnam Airlines have stated that they will not refund 'partially used tickets' and because we got ourselves to Europe, then they don't have to refund or assist us to get home! They also recorded all non-Vietnamese citizens as 'no-shows', despite the fact that we were not physically permitted to reach the check-in counters! <br><br>It is three months on and we have at every avenue been told we will not be able to receive any refund for our flights; despite the fact that is was their responsibility to on-board us or arrange alternatively flights for us and the many other stranded passengers. The airlines are to their detriment, incredibly poor communicators; the irony of yelling at passengers whilst continuing to welcome us to travel again! <br><br>Unfortunately, there is no chance we would use this airline again, nor would we recommend them. We also want to acknowledge that there were many people who lost significantly more than two business class tickets during the pandemic,  so we consider ourselves fortunate in many other ways; but it still doesn't excuse bad behaviour and poor communication. The money will eventually be replaced, but the poor treatment of customers is truly unforgettable!"
54,S N,1,"I was completely ripped off by this airline. I booked my flight with my first/middle/last name exactly as my passport through BYOjet agent, all fields are filled according to their requested fields. Vietnam Airlines is the one who knows the best that Vietnamese passports show name as: last/middle/first name.<br><br>When I came to the airport to depart in November 2019, they said my name is incorrectly field and they said that my name has to be:<br>middle/first/last name.<br><br>Because ""their machine cannot scan my ticket"". If I want to board the flight, I had to pay them $83 for their change name fee. That's their system problem, they have to provide a free update to make it work. Why do I have to pay for updates from my correct name to the wrong one? Do they make their own joking regulation that middle name is in front of the first name? And I'm not the only victim for this name issue on that flight. That's ridiculous. I've been flying with many other airlines: Jetstar, Scoot, Philippine Airlines, Singapore Airlines... without any problem using my first/middle/last name in the booking. My husband travelled with Vietnam Airlines before with his first/middle/last name without any problem. Why only me and another lady on that same flight? And they cannot provide an invoice for this fee after months of asking? Is it an illegal charge that they cannot account for?<br><br>Clearly, they just want to rip people's money. Now, due to the pandemic, they cancel my other flight in July 2020 but said that they would only refund after 3 months or people can get their voucher to use immediately but no flight can be booked from Australia to Vietnam yet. Why we have to pay immediately to book a ticket but Vietnam Airlines can hold my money for 3 months to refund due to their own cancellation? Again, it's ridiculous, Vietnam Airlines just wants to rip people's money by any means that they have."
54,Anders L,1,"If you are planning to fly with Vietnam Airlines, my advice may help. If you don't eat so much, don't drink coffee,tea, wine, beer or soft drink then you should choose Vietnam Airlines. The flight landed yesterday. There was only water on my flight.You must to eat what they serve you,because there is no menu, you won't have any choice. The food on my flight was very poor: rice with chicken, boiled vegetable, a piece of cake, butter and bread. I flied in 12 hours from Hanoi to Frankfurt and they served me twice. There was no snick snack, no baby food, no toothbrush, nothing. I had booked a baby bed for my daughter but They didn't come with it. They gave it to another baby instead. They wouldn't care about passengers' safety. The window on my side was full of fingermarks. I have tried flying with many different companies like Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Etihad, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines, British Airways,... None of them made me so disappointed and angry like this."
54,Hoa Ai Ke,1,My flight was supposed to depart at 13.00. It is now 22.35 and there is still zero information when the flight will leave. Others passengers are understandably irate. It is unbelievable that this is a “4 star airline” rated by Skytraxx. How much did they get paid for the extra two stars??
54,plb27,5,"Ordinarily we would disregard this airline but a holiday to Vietnam really demands you fly with them, and so glad we did.  The service was on par with any other airline we have flown with over the years (we have family in the UK) and we wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again, especially to the UK.  On the ground, their customer service was second to none as we had to rearrange flights due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they handled it with patience and courtesy.  Overall, an airline worth considering when planning your next overseas travel."
54,Ann N,1,"One of the viet male staff yelled at my mum for trying to clarify what he meant because we spoke to him in English but he kept answering in viet (my parents are from a different area with a different accent). He then stopped my dad from boarding ""im going to tear your flight ticket off, if I dont give permission no one is allowed to board"". He was so loud and aggressive that some other female aussies staff had to pull him out of the way to let us board. I guess because we forgot its the ""viet airline culture"" that we have to give tips for a smooth trip. This is the second time we have bad experience. Never again."
55,Kien,3,"Basically, it is a ok flying experience, i means it is not bad but nothing make me suprice. Compary with the price with other airline in local market, i will perfer to choose others cheaper airline next time  if i am in domestic travel. But i will still choose Vietnam Airline for international travel. It will be more comfortable than others."

55,Paul W,1,My flights to Vietnam were cancelled due to Covid 19. on 29th March Vietnam Airlines emailed me to state that they would refund the fares but almost 2 months on nothing despite several reminders.<br><br>Dreadful customer service with zero communication

Both the flights were canceled by Viet Nam airline because Covid 19, we ask for refund money because flights canceled by Viet Nam airline not us. Viet nam Airline did refused to refund money to us and only allow for exchange; <br>We are living at USA booked flights from VN to Taipei and from Taipei to ICN ( Korean) through Priceline both tickets were refunded through priceline even we bought tickets as basic.<br>Lesson learn:<br>1) don’t book direct through Viet Nam airline, need to go through USA travel agency like Priceline, Orbitz ... <br>2) Viet Nam airline is not a 4 stars airline with the way they treat customers, take us long time both by online and phone to answer us, finally they did not refund money but only allow yo exchange even VN airline cancel our trips."
56,Paula P,5,"We were booked to fly from Sydney to Vietnam on 6 April for a special family holiday for my husband's birthday. All of us have just had our refunds. No quibble,courteous communications. Thank you,I am really impressed."
56,Midgar,2,"Flown on vietnam airlines everytime i visit vietnam.  Good experience mostly.   <br><br>Just pray that no one has to try and contact them, they seem to have a phobia of ringing phones.   I've call the office in london, the desk at heathrow and the office in vietnam.   <br><br>No one ever answers the phone, replies to emails take almost a month. <br><br>I'll be switching to a company that easier to contact in future."
56,WoofWoofLondon,4,"Good flight out in Premium Economy.   Efficient check-in at Heathrow, boarding was well organised, the plane left the gate on time and arrived early.  Very comfortable reclining seat with plenty of legroom, friendly crew and OK food.<br>Three internal flights in Economy were punctual but no food/snacks are available - only a bottle of water.<br>I was booked to fly back from Saigon in Business but Covid-19 meant Vietnam was about to be locked down so I had to return earlier than planned.   My UK travel agent found me a seat from Hanoi and, even though it was one of the airline's last flights to London, there were only a handful of passengers in Business.  The crew spent most of the time huddled in the galley and, when they did emerge, were pre-occupied with making sure everyone was wearing masks and gloves.<br>In ""normal"" circumstances I'm sure service would have been more professional but that apart Premium Economy was great value and just as comfortable for an overnight flight unless a flat bed is essential."
56,daventurer,1,"Was desperate to return to Australia before borders were closed as a result of Covid19. Booked Air Vietnam. Paid with credit card, yet within 30 mins, received an email from the booking agency to say that Air Vietnam had canceled my flight. However, on their own website, the flight was still listed. Tried to call Air Viet’s offices in Vietnam and Australia for an explanation of the ‘canceled flight’ and also about the money paid. No one answered the phone in any of the offices I called. In the end, I managed to book a flight with Thai Air. Whilst in the Phnom Penh Airport, I went to the office of Vietnam Airlines in the building adjoining the terminal. There was one man in the office who wouldn’t even let me into the office or talk to me, kept screaming: “Book online, refund online” a few times! The obnoxious arrogant attitude was unbelievable! After I returned to Australia, I tried again to call their Sydney office, but again no answer! Took over a week before the ‘pending’ payment in my bank account was canceled. How lucky was I that I had sufficient funds to book another flight back. What if I had not? To this day, no one from the airline has contacted me to explain why I was able to book and pay for a ‘canceled’ flight or why the ‘canceled’ flight was still listed on their own website as being on schedule. There may be a simple technical explanation, however, there could be no possible explanation for the poor customer service or for the obnoxious attitude of their man in Phnom Penh!"
56,hellem156,4,"We have travelled several times with Vietnam Airlines domistic to and from Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Danang and Nha Trang. Good service and punctuality good."
57,Lyn M,1,"I know that the world is in crisis but that does not explain possibly the worst effort at customer service that I have ever experienced. We are 2 Australians with flights booked on this flight for April 18 - I have emailed, phoned, been given phone numbers that don't answer, I think the last one was just a residential number - I am running out of options to try to change this flight and of course no local number anywhere in sight!  Heaven help dealing with this airline"
57,Voyagearoundtheworld,1,On our way back to Germany  we had the same rude and unpleasant experience again with Vietnam Airlines. The description of the flight experience is the same I gave for the flight from Frankfurt to Saigon earlier on.
57,Voyagearoundtheworld,3,"Fligth attendants were unfriendly, loud,rude and service was reduced to the minimum, we had to ask for each refill and any other service feature that comes naturally with most other airlines. The cabin was filthy, especially the carpet was disgusting. The seat was very uncomfortable. I literally felt penned up. In such a seat it was not possible to have a decent sleep quality. During the night cabin staff was extremely loud in the galley, laughing and talking, opening the curtain thus illuminating the first couple of business class rows. We took the flight because of its nonstop route. Next time we certainly will take a top quality airline with a stop somewhere on the way."
57,ceterpaple,2,"2 internal flights over 2 weeks  and 2 cancelled/ changed flights, 1st flight   cat bi hoa pong  near halong bay  was in formed of cancellation,  changed to hanoi to da nang   times didnt suit  our travel needs  many calls to get changed and to find someone who understood english well enough.<br> 2nd flight da nang to Bangkok  direct ,changed  no notification just happened  to be checking online a couple of days in advance,<br>changed to da nang - hochi min- bangkok ,WELL THEY HAD US ARRIVING IN HOCHI MIN AFTER THE FLIGHT TO BANGKOK HAD DEPARTED, trying to sort this out and making them understand it was there mistake and there changes was a night mare.  trying to get some one who could speak english was impossible , and they kept making out it was our fault it took  2 international calls and 1 local call to sort out still no opolgy, no notification . arriving at airport had a chat with the vietnam airlines info counter , why we were not notified, told try to contact but i must have given wrong info to contact, when i showed him that they had contacted me with other flight cancellation 2 weeks prior he didnt know what to say, never once did they  say sorry,and continued like it was our fault.NEVER AGAIN WILL I FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE"
57,zebragorda,4,We dii not expect much but were pleasantly surprised by the efficient friendly service at this airlines. Typical equipment but good staff.
58,Nikko X'mas,5,"The flight this time was all good. The check-in staffs, boarding time, landing time, flight attendants, food &amp; drink, flight entertainment, service were pretty good. <br><br>Seems that Vietnam airlines is getting better."
58,Nikko X'mas,5,"I went with a 10 month baby, so the check in staff got me &amp; my husband 3 seats coz the flight was not full (2 with a blank seat I meant), this was great...thanks to those guys &lt;3 <br><br>2 flights were both in time...fast and perfect. The food was pretty good."
58,Cat Meow,1,"Flew from DA NANG - ( via Ho Chi Minh ) MELBOURNE 20 / 03 / 20<br>This flight was sold as a ""full Service"" flight, however when we got on the plane we were told there was no alcohol being served due to covid 19 - I then asked about other drinks, juice, tea coffee, they said No, only water the whole long haul flight !! <br>I was NEVER informed this by email or at check in that the flight service was changing, we were never given a choice to refund or offered any compensation.<br>They did feed us, but the food was very very bad. Pasta salad, a main of ( again ) pasta, bread. NO veg, NO fruit. Breakfast was ( you guess it pasta ) Noodles with meat ( there was no choice if you were vegetarian ) and a terrible baby food type of custard which was absolutely disgusting, no coffee, no tea.<br>The seats were incredibly uncomfortable also and the plane was completely full, but they had seats in business and first and did not bother to upgrade anyone. - even if requested.. <br>Also, in the first instance they were not even going to let me board as they told me i could not transit through Australia and i did not have visa , i am from NZ and was allowed to do so, i finally called embassies in vietnam, nz , and Australia after waiting more than an hour in Da nang and then also Ho Chi Minh. Eventually,  i called border force myself  in Melbourne who said of course i could come, and i had to hand over phone to vietnam airlines check in staff, so they would finally allow me to check in. Terrible service.<br>If i could give no stars i would ! <br>Still waiting for a reply to my complaint ! NO response . Don't fly with them"
58,Rod P,4,"We tried Vietnam for the first time after reading that they had updated their fleet of aircraft.  And, yes, the Covid Pandemic was starting to gather momentum when we flew over.  So, the flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh was fine.  We had to wear a mask, but that was no big deal.  The food was good, and drinks were offered on a regular basis.  The in flight entertainment was temperamental, and some seat back screens simply refused to load.  Staff were helpful and polite, all in all we were quite happy with the flight.  Transferring to an internal flight (also on Vietnam Airlines) to go from Ho Chi to Da Nang was problematic, due to a chaos and disorganisation in the airport (nothing to do with the Airline)  The short internal flight was uneventful.  During our holiday our travel agent was contacted by the airline to inform us that the airline was going to suspend flights from midnight on the the 23 March.  Luckily our agent did all the work reorganising our tickets, and we flew home on the last flight on the 23 March.<br><br>That flight was a little different.  Covid was now a very real issue.  When we boarded the flight, the cabin crew were in protective suits, masks and safety glasses.  It was an overnight flight.  Dinner was, well, very ordinary, but given this was a flight that had been put on in a hurry, I suppose I wasn't surprised.  The inflight entertainment this time was far more reliable ( I can't sleep on flights).  As we drew near to Sydney, we got breakfast.  Again, not to my taste, and no options.<br><br>To sum up, I prefer to think that the normal situation with the airline is evidenced by our flight out, which we were very happy with.  With all the things going on at the end of March, I can forgive the issues with the menu, which didn't really worry me.<br><br>Yes, we would fly with them again!"
58,Peter W,2,"We had already cancelled one flight because it changed by 8 hours, this flight only changed by 4 hours. At check in we were informed that we could not get on the plane if we did not wear a mask. Once on board we were all crammed together and yet there were rows of empty seats, clearly not catching corona virus was a priority, NOT."
59,BAZANG,4,Check in was smooth T4 Heathrow. Plane was a Dreamliner and was going direct <br>Premium Economy seats looked comfy and account for 1/3 of the Economy  section<br>Personal  entertainment is very good .cabin service is good .Advise to pre book  seat in advance  ( you have to pay ) as some items on the cabin service  may not be available  if you are near the back <br>Flight left on time and arrived  on time .In flight information  was good and the safety  video  is done as a dance routine <br>Enjoyable over night flight
59,Andrew N,4,"Our first flight with Vietnam Airlines and we continued to use them for domestic flights within Vietnam. The planes were pretty new, clean and with plenty of entertainment and refreshment. The flight attendants and airport staff were all courteous and in gorgeous uniforms. Would use them again without hesitation."
59,Paul F,5,"We flew long haul and short with them. All flights left on time and were comfortable. Staff polite and well trained.<br>Really can't fault them, easily on par with flights we have had with Emirates and Etihad."
59,Jacquie M,5,"We had a good experience flying out with Vietnam Airlines. The staff were great and the food was better than a lot of airlines we've traveled with. Coming back, the staff again were great, but the food was awful. But overall, we would fly with them again."
59,Sandy M,4,"Travelled twice with Vietnam Airlines recently whilst travelling around Vietnam.  The flights were great, the aircraft was modern, however, our trip on the 11th March, as we boarded the plane both the male and female flight attendants were both on their phones, with their heads down and did not acknowledge anyone boarding, which I felt let Vietnam Airlines down."
60,Richard Gere,5,"Travelled from Hanoi to Danang in Vietnam . Comfortable travel good staff with smiling faces . The only bad  thing was the service, only a bottle of water was provided, no other sandwiches or any other food was not available for purchase or not serviced."
60,Alejandro M,5,Pretty good service. Vietnamese people are some of the nicest people in the world and flight attendants are not the exception. It was nothing exceptional but the flight overall was good.
60,André K,4,"Fast check in, Friendly service  and very efficient airline. Will definitely fly again with them. The airline with the most beautiful air hostesses."
60,James N,5,Just an amazing airline with first class service. Flawless check in. Luggage was tagged all the way to my final destination Many thanks and Xin cam on
60,John L,4,"It was my first flight on Vietnam Airlines, and I couldn't find any reviews for flights from SIN to SGN. But based on the general reviews on other routes, I took a chance and was very pleasantly surprised.  Check in at Changi Airport's Terminal 4 was smooth; the boarding experience was pleasant and friendly (although we couldn't see the faces of the cabin crew as they were taking health precautions for the current coronavirus situation by wearing masks), and the cabin was very clean.<br><br>The economy seat legroom was rather good &amp; spacious on this Airbus A321 plane (3-3 seating with single aisle) ; the inflight entertainment was provided by common shared screens above the seats (they could have screened something a little more general like Mr Bean, or Just For Laughs, instead of a football match!) , but it didn't really matter as it was a short 1.5 hour flight. The provided meal was a very plain, not-so-appetizing cold ham sandwich bun, with a spritz of mayo, and a bottle of mineral water, but we didn't really expect more from the affordable fare we paid. The landing was good and on schedule; and disembarkation was smooth.  All in all, a really good, nice and pleasant flight!"
61,David Y,5,"I choose this flight because it was the return for the five of us.  Fourteen hours but what a fabulous aircraft the 787 Dreamliner is.  Comfort, low noise levels, plenty of entertainment and a very good service from staff.  This airline has to be recommended."
61,jasminecastle63,4,"i have flown with vietnam air before so i knew they were good, international and domestic, flight crew are always very pleasant and curteous, food is so so, includes entertainment and check in luggage, a travel pillow and blanket, so all good"
61,Jet692084,5,"Excellent Airline to fly with, prices were excellent, meals AAA+, Service was amazing wouldn't fly any other Airline to Vietnam. A Direct fight, with no stop over made it easy, Very comfortable seating with plenty of legroom. The 787 dream-liner was quiet and cosy. Cabin staff were superb. Will fly with them again. Pilots and cabin crew are trained by Qantas"
61,Roy f,5,We flew direct from Heathrow to Hanoi in January and returned in March during that time we had five internal flights all with Vietnam Airlines. We found the planes comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful and the food acceptable. Their customer service is excellent they respond very quickly to any enquiry and always resolve any issues. Their new baggage policy is very good and I would recommend this airline to any travellers in Asia.
61,Michael M,5,We took two flights with Vietnam Airlines within Vietnam.  This was our first trip to Asia so we did not know what to expect.  The level of service was the same or better than any North American carrier.  We saw that there were low-cost airlines but decided to spend a few more dollars -  so glad we did.  I highly recommend Vietnam Airlines!
62,Hannah,5,"Very clean, comfortable flight. Staff was so friendly and it felt very relaxed....so unlike our flight to Seoul from the US with a different airline."
62,Kerry M,5,"I'm a totally staunch and committed Virgin Frequent Flyer and the first time I went to Vietnam I went via Singapore on Sing Airlines (partner of Virgin).  The next time we were in the Corona Virus ERA and I didn't want to go via Singapore, so I went with Vietnam Airlines instead.  <br><br>I had done a few internal sectors with the airline previously and had signed up with Lotus Airmiles and was surprised that I got priority seating when checking in just for being a LFF.  Very impressed, I certainly will not go with another airline to Vietnam again.  Good leg room.  Good price premium economy seats for the way back (overnight).  Opportunites to upgrade to business both by email and 90 minutes before the flight leaves (check on that - I missed out time wise and it gets more expensive closer to the time)"
62,jeff1955malaysia,4,took a morning flght from kuala lumpur to ho chi minh city.  flight was on schedule and the service was good. we were provided a meal which was good and hot. enjoyed my flight.
62,Old Nick,4,"Travelled premium economy.<br>Seat size, quality and leg room was great.<br>Entertainment e.g. films were a little limited.<br>Food was sparse and below par."
62,895lucy,4,"Well worth paying the extra forBusiness Class, we both slept most of the way. The service was friendly &amp; helpful &amp; food quite nice"
63,mouseHerts,5,"In spite of the many health forms to fill out, the temperature checking and waiting for cancelled planes, the flight itself was comfortable and the staff came round constantly with snacks and drinks as well as serving a delicious lunch and breakfast. The landing was very smooth."
63,Jlogez,4,As an example for Australians the standard of the airline is in between Jetstar and Virgin. Very short flight but no complaints except that they should maybe provide more buses to transport from the plane to the terminal. More and more travellers were pushed onto the buses like sardines. Not that safe especially at the moment with the virus.
63,Cynthia P,3,Plane was cleaner than most. We were in business class on a short flight.  Service was non-existent.  We received a small bottle of water and bag of some snack.  Flights attendants stayed behind the curtain for most of the flight.
63,Prue P,5,Very nice. Staff were friendly and food was acceptable. Smooth flight.  Gotta love the 787 Dreamliner!
63,Ginette A,3,"Ok flight, all on time but still quite basic.<br>Not very good seat space of a long flight.<br>Going out we sat in a window seat but there was no window just a white panel.<br>Food ok but they ran out of the english option for breakfast so we had pork and noodles, already had pork for our dinner.<br>Flight home we were not offered and coffee or tea after dinner and there was not a lot of choice for snacks."
64,Walkhome,4,"Flew UK to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) return with four internal flights. The business class seating on the London - Saigon - London flights was 1-2-1 with a very comfortable flat bed. Food was good too although service was somewhat inconsistent and the recent movies available on the  entertainment system limited but fine for my needs. On the internal flights again business class seating was far superior to for example, BA.  A very good experience."
64,Nickybud,5,During the outbreak still spreading but the hosts took care their customers quite well enough that I found myself satisfied. They treated guests in a really professional way.
64,Adventure815352,5,"I have traveled a lot in my career, worldwide, many airlines. Vietnam Airlines was a very good experience. I normally fly Business Class but since this was a short flight,<br>I rode in economy. The  airport facilities were modern and clean, abundant lavatory<br>facilities and adequate duty free. Airport staff was friendly and proficient, and the <br>check in process was smooth, the aircraft was very clean, comfortable (I am 180CM-<br>100KG) and the inflight service was adequate for a 2 hour flight. Definitely a good<br>choice of airlines and recommend using."
64,Rizal H,2,"The flight going to Moscow was good. It was pretty empty, we got a lot of space and the cabin was excellent too.<br><br>On coming back, it was cramped in an older plane.<br><br>Their food was ok. I can't say much as I have ordered the Halal/Moslem meal. <br><br>My main issue with them is not responding to my claim for baggage damage.  It has been more than 3 months, no one comes back to me on my claim. Very frustrating."
64,ASC,5,Proficient; Friendly service in new clean aircraft. Definitely a first class airline. Highly recommend using this airline when traveling in and around Asia
65,johnlynch19,3,Travelled premium economy which had good legroom &amp; comfortable seats. The meals were the same as economy &amp; were pretty ordinary. Service was soso. Have travelled with Qantas PE which was  really good. Cabin crew really looked after you &amp; nothing was a trouble.
65,bmelland,4,"Nice new plane<br>Good service, helpful fligth attendants.<br>Quick luggage delivery.<br>Flight on schedule, no delays."
65,ozallan,4,A short flight but comfortable. A modern A321 plane. Good legroom  in economy. A small snack is served. Efficient and friendly.
65,Suzie,2,Flying from bkk to hochiminh is cold temperature. We asked for blankets they refuse to give. This is big surprise that I asked for simple issues but they can not supply.<br><br>Food during the flight is not good either
65,Marie F,4,"Been Travelling with Vietnam Airlines for the last 20 years.<br>Great Friendly Service, very hospitable,  <br>Great food,  comfortable Business Class and Lots of Room.<br>I also have traveled to Europe with them, transiting through Ho Chi Minh.<br>Highly Recommended."
66,Elizabeth Q,3,"I have flown on several occasions with Vietnam Airlines with varying degrees of satisfaction, this unfortunately was not one of the best flights. This was mainly due to the presence in the cabin of a toddler aged child. It is my opinion that small children should not be allowed in Business Class. The traveller pays extra for a Business Class seat to travel in relative comfort and peace, especially on a night flight, the latter is not possible with a small child present. Also, the service was somewhat inefficient, I was brought the wrong dinner order and the general service was lacking in attentiveness. The Lotus Lounge at Hanoi Noi Bai airport is a dismal place, always overcrowded, the selection of food is very limited and there is no champagne."
66,Robert L,4,"Flew from Heathrow to Hanoi with my wife.<br>Had paid (a modest amount) for the two seats at the rear of the plane.<br>Good choice as the seats were comfortable, the leg room was ok and there was loads of space between the window seat and wall. Two rucksacks, pillows,blankets etc.<br>Cabin crew were reasonably attentive and food was fine.<br>Flight on time.<br>Would be happy to fly with them again"
66,Michael E,5,I was very impressed with Vietnam Airlines. The planes were very modern and comfortable. The staff were extremely hard working and helpful. I felt well looked after. The choice of entertainment was broad and I watched a lot of films. The food was good and plentiful.
66,449jeanpaulr,3,"Vietnam really needs to learn how to stop lying to customers. I am a platinum member and there is an entitlement to seat on first row. I was offered a window seat as there is no seat on aisle ""quote from VN checking counter"". Only one seat was occupied on the other side, terrible service for the 5am flight specially during this difficult period when the airport is empty.<br>And guest what, transfer by bus upon arrival in Hanoi, incredible but true. Fly with Bamboo airline and you do not have to be transferred via bus"
66,Jackie,5,"This is a great airline to fly, smooth flight and great service. I've also flown to Europe on Vietnam Airlines, great flight at great price, but connections a bit long!"
67,claire f,4,"Good airline, helpful staff, the food was very nice with a choice of dishes, up to date films with new releases. Left on time and arrived early. Would use them again if i went to that part of the world."
67,Michael Margolin Travel Associates Coy,4,"I have reviewed Premium before.<br>The food, service, and comfort are good but Vietnam Airlines has been increasing the airfare for Premium to a point where it is questionable as to whether it is worth it.<br>Flew return on Jetstar Business Class and found that while Vietnam Airlines Premium was better, Jetstar Biz class was cheaper than Vietnam Airline's economy !"
67,LaurentCL2,3,"It's a shame that they don't notify you a change in the departure time. There is ZERO excuse not to send a notification.<br>The staff onboard does their job but I can't say that they are friendly, nor they collect the trash before landing.<br>No food was served because of the coronavirus. Good excuse not to serve food!!! Specially since there were just a very few cases in Vietnam. Another way to save money!<br>The seats were tight.<br>In a country with not so many airlines, you don't have too many options!"
67,ROSSYSHIN,5,"I used Vietnam Airlines with my younger sister disabled to Phu Quoc from Busan.<br>I had to transfer once at Ho Chi Minh because this line doesn't run directly.<br>When I checked in, the crew changed our seat to front, it was very convenience.<br>VN423 offer Boing 787, the flight was much better than Korean Air from Busan, including flight system, seat pitch, entertainment in the flight.<br>Ih Ho Chi Minh, a crew guided us to domestic terminal from international terminal. He, Pham Huu Nam, was very good to us. He helped us to pick up our luggage in international terminal, also send it in domestic terminal.If it weren't for him, we would have wandered around Ho Chi Minh Airport for a long time. When I told him thank you, he said it was the system of Vietnam Airlines. I was surprised to have a very handicapped-friendly system.<br> I want to praise him and this system!

67,wanazainal,3,"We were travelling as a big group of family consisting of kids too. Staffs were loud and firm when giving instructions, that not more than 1 kid in the same aisle. My 5 months old was crying and on top of that the staffs was so persistent that the baby be in the row infront of us, where my other family members were. There were no smiles or courtesy from them. Then there were the meals. We require special dietary, Halal certified meals. However the meals wasn't confirmed and wasn't served to us. We clarified with them again, and all they did was continually handing the non-halal meal to us. The worst part he said, don't eat the meat. Eat the fish. It was such a bad experience, we didn't wanna make a fuss, just at some biscuits coz my baby wanted to milk and sleep by then."
68,Navigate370697,2,"I have traveled Vietnamairlines, LHR to Siem Reap, on a number of occasions.    Travelling from HR to Cambodia via Vietnam is a quick and economical route. Having to fly from terminal 4 HR always a poor experience.<br><br>The latest flight, August 2019, is probably my last. <br><br>Unable to book either a seat or request a meal online and with no help from local ( UK) staff or “online help” I enventualy phoned Vietnam. Apparantly because there was an onward flight to Siem Reap ( operated by Vietnamairways and Cambodian air) I was unable to use their web site.  With a disability it was important for me to pre-book an isle seat but I was unable to do so. <br>I did  however order a low calorie meal by phoning Vietnam.  I  can only describe what was  provided as worthy of school meals of the 1950's.   How do you cook breast of chicken to a consistency that breaks the cutlery? that was 2 meals?<br> <br>On the positive side the aircraft took off and landed more or less as per schedule.<br>The cabin crew were so-so. With mobility problems I did not appreciate be hurried along on embarkation."
68,Rainer Arnold,5,Great service.<br>Plenty of legroom even in economy.<br>Very clean.<br>Nice food and plenty of water to drink.
68,PaulH,5,"My first time flying Vietnam Airlines,I was not quite sure what to expect.But the plane was quite modern,very  clean.Flight crew very pleasant &amp; helpful,service was as good as I have ever experienced. Food was above average.   Return flight was equally as pleasant, will definately fly with this airline again,"
68,nadiak97,1,First time travelling on Vietnam Airlines and we were really disappointed. 50 minute flight we were only given water and wet hand towel. All other full service carriers offer peanuts or some small snack. Hostess next to us was falling asleep-very unprofessional. Only good thing was the aircraft was clean and brand new. Had better service domestically on VietJet.
68,Steve S,5,"Good airline - organised, competitive, food on all flights included<br>Nice friendly staff apart from Phu Quoc Airport - this was a real disappoiment - nobody interested in any information and kept you queing for no reason"
69,Beth A,4,Took three different flights through Vietnam. Each time it was an easy check in and baggage claim. The food offered was tasty and the seats were comfortable. The ride was smooth and pleasant
69,Seaside773845,4,"A choice of two starters, two mains and two desserts.<br><br>28 people in business class.<br><br>Now, you would think that given the extra you pay for business class that there would be enough for everyone to have their choice, but no! <br><br>A wonderful looking starter and they ran out by row 4, similarly the main.<br>And that happened with two meals on two flights.<br><br>In fairness, they did serve the people who missed out first for the next meal, which being breakfast, wasn't that exciting.<br><br>I just can't see why they are cutting corners and rationing meals, when everyone has paid for the same level of service.<br><br>Not good enough."
69,Fausta F,4,"I took a flight from Italia to Hanoi, the flight was so great, and the crew was enthusiastic All of the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The food provided was excellent and there was plenty of leg room. I wouldn't hesitate to travel again with them in the future."
69,Nanette T,1,"Apparently in business class from Sydney to Danang u are allowed 2 bags and internal business class a policy change to 1. ( what do u do with the extra bag?)<br>The company then tries to charge for the extra bag! Average service at best and now this change. <br>Lack of business planning, poor policy coordination requires immediate review. <br>Very disappointing when the travel market has slipped dramatically in momentum!"
69,martin b,5,"Thought we would try this airline to travel to Australia after agent recommended them. No regrets. Great value for business, on time, excellent catering and attentive friendly cabin crew. Wholeheartedly recommend."
70,daniel_krycha,5,"We flew twice domestic, from Ho Chi Minh to Da Lat and from there to Da Nang. Very cheap tickets (20-35 eur per person) so I was a bit sceptical. It turned out great; both flights on time, decent legspace, smooth check in. I could not find anywhere if our luggage was included so I prepared to pay - it was included. Recommended!"
70,LorraineLavoie,4,"MONTRÉAL -Shanghaï was with Air Canada , Shanghai - Bangkok was with Air China  -Bangkok to finely Ho Chi Ming was with Vietnam Airlines<br>We reserve the flight in MONTRÉAL every think went fine no problem.  Even if the flight was only 2 hours they serve us a little snack.  Very helpful staff."
70,Ian P,5,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines on three occasions, once flying out to Vietnam, once on an internal flight and once to return. I have no complaints with anything from any of the flights. All of the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The food provided was excellent and there was plenty of leg room. I wouldn't hesitate to travel again with them in the future."
70,Husnie P,1,Vietnam airline is the worst airline I ever met. We have Covid 19 situation around the word. South Korea is second highest amount of quarantines and infections. But this airline never has the policy for free refund or reschedule the flight! Charge even changing flight and so on. The announcements came from the airline only for their benefits such in Vietnam is still safe. They need to have social responsibility especially for this disease that have a large effected!
70,Kim G,5,"We traveled with Gate 1 Tours, who booked us on Vietnam Airlines for three different legs during our travels.  Each flight offered a light lunch and refreshment.  We traveled economy, and found the seating and leg room comfortable."
71,Jerome B,5,"Actually took several short hops on Vietnam Airlines during a three week trip in SE Asia.  Both the domestic and the international flights were fine, though it would have been nice to get something other than a cup of water on the flights."
71,votrong57,4,"crew is good trained, pilot good experiences, services good , good feeling the flight only one thing is not so good the price"
71,lynette h,3,"We flew back yesterday in Premium Economy, although we had purchased Business Class on the website but apparently the payment didnt go thorugh..<br>The seats were very comfortable, and we were given the 3 seats together after the confusion at Hanoi Airport, the crew were very indifferent, its difficult to see their faces as they all wear the masks, they dont interact with passengers, drinks and food are just put down in front of you, its also difficult to hear the PA annoucements as they are so quiet. Overall if they are the ones who fly to Hanoi and Vietnam direct then there isnt a lot of choice, but given the chance go for the Buisness Class, you wont get any more smiles but you get to stretch out and the food is much better"
71,Jane,5,This was our first experience of Vietnam airlines having booked 3 flights with them for our 3 week trip around Vietnam and Cambodia. We were pleasantly surprised especially since we had read some poor reviews. Booking was easy and website was easy to negotiate. Plane was clean and seats were good with generous legroom. Check in desk sat us with a spare seat between as plane wasn't full due to many Chinese cancellations. We got free drinks and a nice meal included. Staff were lovely and 23kg luggage allowance was plenty.
71,Robert M,5,We went Business Class and we loved it both ways and in row 4 in the middle the service was great left on time .<br>we would do it again but may have to look at not so much layover in Ho Chi Ming City for the next flight 4 hours wait but otherwise everything was good we would fly with them again.
72,PaulPSydney,4,"This is the second time I have flown Premium Economy on the Boeing 787 with Vietnam Airlines. The seating would have to be the best and most comfortable of all premium economy's I have flown. I would say even better than some of the discounted airlines business class (eg Jetstar). Service is excellent, always with a smile. The food was just average but that is not a big issue for me. Priority check in, so you don't have to wait in a big queue. Definitely worth the extra dollars."
72,EMMA B,5,"We flew several times during our holiday with vietnam airlines and we couldnt fault them. Flights were on time. Planes were clean and well equipped.  Little extras..bag with slippers and tooth brush. Extras in toilets,  wash stuff. Food was nice..good selection. And the stewards/Ess were pleasant and happy. Would definitely fly with them again."
72,Explore828186,2,"The check in was pretty smooth. However, the Vietnamese speaking pilot did not make the announcements in Vietnamese, just in English and he spoke too fast that I could not understand exactly what he had said. Ditto the chief flight attendant!!! What an insult to both English and Vietnamese speaking travellers!<br><br>The service was pretty normal, including food and beverages"
72,Travelaround59,3,A bit disappointed from my flights in Business Class with Vietnam Airlines...nothing is offered but a bottle of water? We got 2 explanations:<br>1) because of Coronavirus they do not provide any service;<br>2) flight less then 1 hour (but the flight was a bit longer than 1 hour!).<br>So probably wasn’t really worth?!?
72,Lucian C,5,"I was flying from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minn City with Vietnam airline .The service was ok ,departure in time . Because was a short flight 1:20 hour service was only water.In airport there are smoking rooms,court foods and shopping boutiques.."
73,Dmcsparron,4,"Flew to Saigon from Sydney Australia on Vietnam Airlines.<br>All new aircraft- Boing Dreamliner.<br>Seating was 3-4-3. We had an aisle and centre seat in middle section. I am 5’11 and I had reasonable legroom considering we were flying economy class. Flight was 8 hours, long enough,not to long. Crew were competent but not very friendly. Meals were okay, coffee and tea terrible, getting something to drink after meals was a bit slow.<br>Our return flight was similar.<br>Would I fly with them again ? Yes but I would try to fly business class for the air bed so that I might get a bit of sleep."
73,Alison P,5,"We flew Premium Economy. Seats were comfy, the staff were polite, friendly and courteous and nothing was too much trouble. We were fed and watered continuously - even a midnight snack if you were awake! Loved the light dimming windows to help you adjust to the changing time zones. Entertainment was ok, maybe not as good as some airlines but there was enough keep us entertained in between sleeping, eating and reading! All in all would have no hesitation in recommending."
73,Stef-M-SG,2,"Took a domestic flight on Vietnam airlines between HCMC and Hanoi. After the flight I had to recheck the price I paid because I did not see how my money has been used by the company... Before take-off: surprise boarding by bus...  Food: a poor sandwich and water. USB plug to charge the phone: not working (lets say I was not lucky with my seat). You cannot use the screen until 10min after take-off and 10min before landing, so no choice but to follow some ads from banks, electronics brands, resorts... there is even mentions to duty free items (since when are we entitled to duty free on domestic flights?). Movie selection: not bad but they do not provide any headset (?). First time I see that. Even the low cost flights I took are not so bad, at least you know that a low cost flight is like that, but a bit surprising for a national carrier. The plane, an A350, was good. Oh I just got it: they put all the money on the plane and then got broke so could not purchase the headsets or provide quality food."
73,Betty R,3,"This airline is usually on time with good service but I absolutely hate the overcrowded bus to get from the terminal to the airplane when you board in Saigon. The bus is always crowded so badly that the passengers are pressed tightly against one another and bumping each other with bags and luggage. I was so uncomfortable and felt squashed the whole bus trip to the terminal, which was very long! <br>In other countries they allow a comfortable space and don't cram the people in like sardines!! <br>Just add another another bus! <br>There should be 3 buses not 2!! <br>I included a Pic of the crowded bus too!"
73,Brian L,5,"Premium Economy, great seats, plenty of leg room. Service excellent, movies poor. Food very good by airline standards. Left LHR 11am, arr Hanoi early morning 5am, quite refreshed! Not bad for such a long flight.<br>Return  overnight, 00.20 from HMC, Arr LHR about 7am, not quite as good, food average but seats excellent. Premium Economy is well worth the extra cost for long journeys.<br>Would definitely fly with them again."
74,Michael P,5,"From the very start of check-in you could tell this was  a very professional airline, staff attentive, respectful, nothing was too much trouble. Both my partner and I being tall we requested extra leg room seats luckily we were able to obtain them., which made all the difference. the food was surprisingly good for economy and no delays."
74,Luan N,3,"Short flight, uneventful, but seems like the customary greetings or smiley faces from the flight attendants were missing upon entering or leaving the plane.   Even when my wife asked for help locating an overhead bin space for her carry on, a female attendant just pointed to the 2 or 3 bins down, without any words.  I had to follow up and find the space and stow the luggage."
74,murphypickle,3,"Flight was OK but no food or drink on a 2 hour flight ""to help prevent the spread of Coronavirus"" Utter rubbish. More like money saving. Ticket purchased included food and drink so should have been offered a partial if the reason was genuine"
74,ExVotoFatum,4,"Second time 11,5 hours flight in premium eco and I can recommend. Seats are spacious and offer friendly enough legroom and decline. Food was good, staff friendly, entertainement ok.<br>Headphones are lousy and they do not come very often with water or snacks during this  long flight. <br>Check in Frankfurt was very good as there is special ckeck in boarding for premium eco <br>passengers."
74,We3Me,1,"We had to cancel our business class tickets that were fully refundable. Now Vietnam Airlines won’t give money back because they say the amount for refunding being bigger than we originally paid for! What?! We have given several clear statements that we don’t want any surplus money but just only the amount we have orginally paid excluding possible fees. That doesn’t help - now almost a month we have already been waiting for that but no any given refund yet! Even credit card company tries to get money back but nothing happens. Very frustrating and untrustworthy airline and this is totally unacceptable for modern company that tries to get new foreign customers. Please, be aware of that!"
75,Regular reviewer,5,"Just turned from a multi-destination trip to Vietnam and Cambodia - 5 flights in all, mix of internal and international so we’ve had extensive experience of long and short haul in a short period of time. Flew economy as part of a Secret Escapes Deal. <br>Outstanding value: it was an economy package so no we didn’t have champagne and strawberries but the food was perfectly acceptable, Flights took off on time (one slight change but we were given adequate notice of a 50 minute change) we were well looked after throughout,<br>I do hope someone at VA picks this up and forwards the following to the appropriate customer service rep. <br>During our overnight flight home we had an issue with a fellow passenger. Seated behind us was a young 5 year-old who, after initially sleeping for a couple of hours woke up and proceeded to repeatedly kick my wife’s chair while tapping repeatedly on a the TV screen on the back of my wife’s chair playing a video game. Not a happy experience at 0300! When asked to stop the child from doing so he became both aggressive and threatening. Rather than escalate the issue I reported it to cabin staff. Their response was truly amazing. They took control of the situation immediately, found us alternative seating (upgraded) and made it quite clear to the father that his behaviour was unacceptable and that he was responsible for ensuring that his child’s behaviour did not upset fellow travellers. MANY many thanks to the cabin crew concerned - please could you ensure that this review is ultimately forwarded to whoever is responsible for reviewing the performance of the staff involved. They defused a potentially volatile situation promptly, sensitively and professionally."
75,Darin C,5,"Excellent experience....from top to bottom.  Courteous staff, on time flight...smooth flight.  Airline was clean and spacious...we have zero complaints."
75,Vin Ng,1,Flight schedule departure timing last minutes changed even after I've checked in online and has the boarding pass printed.<br>Schedule was supposed on VN650 departing from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh on the 14 Feb 2020 at 13:15 hrs but changed to departure time to 18:25 hrs on new flight  VN654.<br>It was the Valentine Day on that day and l had a connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang on the same day. No choice I brought a new air ticket on budget airline.<br>My returning flight from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore on the 17 Feb VN655 at 14:05 hrs was also got changed to VN 657 at 16:10 hrs. Returning timing delayed still acceptable but I need to take the trouble to Ho Chi Minh Vietnam Airline Office to re-confirmed my returning flght.  <br>This was my first time booking for Vietnam Airline but will be my last as well.
75,Olivier F,1,"The flight was Ok but enormous surprise: when I booked and paid the flight on Internet, I had 23 kg of checked bagage included. At the airport desk they told me no. They said they can accept 10 kgs as hand luggage but that is all. I had 14 kgs. So for 4 additional kgs I had to pay on the spot 60 US$! Otherwise I would have to give up flying.<br>On the way back I enquired before being at the airport. They said if you pay now you will pay 50 US$ instead of 60. However, no way to get it as checked luggage. Painful experience indeed!"
75,redotrip,5,This was our first trip with Vietnam Airlines and it was Fantastic...Our Crew was Great and Business Class was very impressive. Meals and Beverage selection great and Comfortable Trip altogether. We look forward to flying with you again..
76,wilcockg,5,"Separate transportation to the plane,small lounge prior.A short 90 min flight.After landing private vehicle to the terminal.From landing to going through arrivals just 7 mins,never seen such efficient baggage reclaim"
76,JasonfromJoplin,4,We had 3 flights first was part of escorted tour.  The plane was huge an A350-900  Very new very clean.  Second was on our own Hanoi to siem reap  Average nice plane standard to good service  But delayed twice  3 rd was bad  Da Nang to Hanoi  OLD plane worn down seats non working monitors and delayed
76,Suzie G,4,Very nice experience.  Food and customer service was better than average.<br><br>I would be pleased to travel with this airline in the future.
76,QAdiQ,5,I like the food the service and the smiling faces when you board a VN Airlines flight.<br><br>The chairs have enough room for tall people I am 183 cm so unlike Vietject where my legs are stuck in one position all flight I am comfortable.<br><br>The Pilots are good and rarely do they crunch the planes into the ground when landing<br><br>The only issue I have is their Melbourne Airport manager is extremely rude and lazy <br><br>I am a Platinum Plus member  and last flight I asked if it was possible for my partner and her daughter to have the seat blocked out from Melbourne to Saigon and firstly as I had not received my new card he said I was not a Platinum member and had to make him look it up on his computer but he was then rude saying he could not do.<br><br>When flying my partner noticed a third or the plane vacant so he could have assisted move the lady that was placed next to them in another seat so they could stretch out on the nearly 9 hrs flight.<br><br>VN Airlines you need to make your Airport Managers more friendly
76,Travellotto,4,Can confirm another good flight with Vietnam Airlines. On time and precise. The only thing I did not understand was the measure adopted about the Coronavirus where they decided not to serve food but just a bottle of water. I think that a packed snack would have been appreciated and managed as per the bottled water.
77,Thibaud J,5,"First flight, domestic, between Danang and Hanoi. <br>On time, comfortable seats.<br>Also easy to buy online, and smooth online check in too. <br>No food, but cheap Tickets, so I have no problem to recommend that airline."
77,Emilie G,5,"We flew six times during the month of December 2019 with Vietnam Airlines: two international flights (from and to Paris) and four internal flights. All our flights were on time and well managed. The aircraft was clean and fairly comfortable. We definitely felt safe and the staff was even friendly (during the internal flights). We found the prices correct for the quality, quite cheap in fact. We would definitely recommend it and fly with this company again."
77,Diana S,1,"The ground staff manager from Vietnam Airlines let us down in Ho Chi Minh airport. Here is an excerpt from my full story:<br>...<br>Waiting for the next flight out, we spend 10 hours in the ""health quarantine""/detention center, in a well lit, dirty and unhygienic room without food and internet. The bedding was not changed in ages, so using it posed a risk of getting infected and the bathroom, which also all the officers used, had a strong urine smell and sticky floor. These are not exactly conditions one wants to spend 10 hours in while trying to avoid the virus. Also calling my embassy was only permitted reluctantly by the ground staff manager of Vietnam Airlines which proved to be not only rude but unprofessional as well, leaving us without our luggage and food. She called us ""deportees"" and treated us as such.<br><br>...."
77,Roger W,4,"Check in was easy, flight left on time, plenty of legroom ( I am 6ft 2) good value for money, cabin staff very helpful"
77,Tam L,1,I did have no choice for the trip then going with vietnam airlines. I was so disappointed with checkin counter staffs. They were so rude with passengers and always thought like they are the main player in the game.
78,Tam L,1,I had to face with huge problem everytime I went with vietnamairline. They gave very bad service from ground staffs to the air. My recommendation is to other better airline like vietjet or bamboo. Be mind that jetstar is also a member of vietnamairline then should be removed from vendor list too
78,Chris K,2,Been flying with Vietnam Airlines whenever I work there as need to go many cities. Can say their service is very poor from customer service to crew. No smiling faces and not friendly. They even told me that my name was not inside the system when I showed them my printed out confirmation email. Took them like 20mins to sort it out. I am even a gold flyer in Vietnam Airlines but they are just sucks at time. What I can in Vietnam they are the best among the worst. Not really much delays but don't expect too much.
78,Ramadurai R,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the type of aircraft they offered in this segment, seating arrangements and service provided. Seats are a bit narrow and length wise a bit cramped but decent enough to stretch out. Quality of food is ok"
78,Travellotto,5,"As I did for the flight from Thailand to Vietnam, I confirm the good service received also for the domestic flights, from Hanoi to Da Nang e from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh the flights were always on time and the staff impeccable and kind"
78,Travellotto,5,First time I flew Vietnam Airlines and can only recommend it. Booked for the flight from Bangkok and it was on time and the staff very polite and helpful
79,Col Suku,3,"The flight to Hanoi was pleasant, however the approach to Hanoi and the landing was horrific.  Have flown on many flights and this one was quite bad.  The flight back to Kuala Lumpur was pleasant."
79,Antony H,5,"Pleasantly surprised at how good this airline is. It was a cheap, budget flight but the aircraft, staff and facilities were excellent, Much better than Air Asia, Malindo Air, etc., and the other budget airlines in this area. Even the food was good, <br>It was so good that we are considering our Next flights from uk to Thailand on Vietnam Airlines."
79,Michael Ho,4,I'm been on this airline since 2011and I'm always impressed by their standard of commitment to safety and excellent service. Congratulations for winning the best airline award for medium range aircraft.
79,Lucile C,4,"Long Bay and Tu Long Bay. <br>Beautiful!<br>It’s about 170 km from Hanoï/Hai Pong aéroport and takes about 5 hours drive but there is an international aeroport, Noi Bay, only 40 km from Ha Long Bay. Don’t make the same mistake as me..I had to book another flight to make it for my next stop.."
79,adrianaaronchen,5,"Check in was a breeze and the ground staff were very friendly, smiley and welcoming! Vietnam Airlines is always my favourite carrier as flights are always on time. I have not had a delay before. On board, the staff were smiley and attentive. Planes are clean and comfortable. <br><br>Business class comes with complimentary lounge access (i enjoyed the Lotus lounge more than the premium lounge) and special lane at the immigration which helps in terms of my wait time.  <br><br>Well done VA!"
80,DocViny10,5,"The travel to Da Nang was one of my very memorable experiences. Both bad and good.<br><br>Upon arriving to Noibai (HAN), I was immediately faced with a dilemma of traveling to the next aiport which was for the local flight. There were no connecting routes to the airports and it was late at night. The only option was getting a Grab, which take note were full of scammers around. Imagine in my app it says 55000dong and they came forward to me asking 150000dong. Sorry not me that's a no no. Eventually I got a good Grab one (Thank you for him) and got to my local flight ahead of time.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines wearing their blue traditional vietnam uniform looked very classy 👌. And the flow was very good and accommodating. The flight was in the middle of the free way so I had to ride a shuttle bus togl get there and I saw the most beautiful sunrise 🌅 it was amazing.<br><br>The ride was so smooth that I slept throughout the whole ride and just woke up to the sound of landing. 😂 Thus was a very eventful time for me."
80,Kimba,5,Travelled on Premium economy for $500 extra. Great value for the price paid. Service on board was great and we were greeted by Vietnamese airline staff when we arrived in Ho Chi Min city and escorted to the domestic terminal and they helped us with priority check in so that we could make our connecting flight to Phu Quoc
80,William B,5,"The in flight magazine was great, and lead me to make a trip to South America based on an article I found in it.<br><br>Being honest, my flight was in November 2018, but you didn't give me the scroll down option!"
80,David Tal,5,"My first long flight and it was nice. Comfortable seat, yummy food,  enough entertainment. A little noisy flew back cuz kids played around. I had 3 dish and not easy to finish them all, flight attendants helped. Recommend!"
80,Emmanuel N,1,"I am MOST displeased with Vietnam airlines with regards to my return trip from Singapore to Vinh. First, they altered my domestic flight (from my Hanoi-Vinh) leg, pushing it two hours later, and spoiling my land transfer plans.<br>Secondly, they cancelled my return domestic flight (Vinh to Ho Chi Minh), which caused my to miss my international flight back to Singapore. They simply pushed me to another flight 24hours later, with NO offer of accommodation costs. And when I had to make alternative arrangements, they also offered NO financial help, telling me that no refund would be given, even for the cancelled flight.<br><br>This is absolutely IRRESPONSIBLE and UNPROFESSIONAL. I am most disgusted by the service, and will never fly on this airline ever again."
81,Al1,1,"*** do not book flights with Vietnam airlines. In case of error on their website, and this is very frequent, you will be forced to pay twice for your flight ***<br>Hi, I have flown a return flight from London to Ho Chi Minh in December - January 2019/2020. This was my first time dealing with Vietnam airlines. I booked the flights in November through the Vietnam airlines website and the process resulted in multiple unreliabilities and errors and which made me end up with 2 tickets unbeknownst to me. <br>The website was painfully slow and unreliable to use (I checked my internet connection speed and it was fine ~15 Mbps). After having checked the flights for a couple of days and seeing the prices increasing steadily, I decided to buy my flights. After going through the painfully slow process of using the Vietnam airlines website, I entered my payment details and clicked the buy button. The web page went blank and loading and stayed in this state for 20 minutes after which I decided to reload the page. When I clicked reload, a page saying the following appeared: “If you have no received any confirmation of your booking within one hour, please consider that the booking process has failed and book again your flight”. The webpage promptly disappeared after a few seconds et went blank again. <br>I then waited for 40 minutes and checked my email multiple times and received no confirmation emails. After waiting a little bit more and as per the instructions that I saw on the previous webpage, I proceeded to book again the flight. I took different seats this time and after entering the payment details, the process failed again in the same way. I proceeded to wait again and this time I received a confirmation email after 30 minutes which was for the second booking (I could see it due to the seat reservation being different). As of February 2020 I never received any confirmation emails for the first booking.<br>Now the problem is that after a few days I saw that Vietnam airlines debuted my credit card for the 2 flights! So I proceeded to dispute the charges. One month later, I was told by my credit card company that Vietnam airlines told them that they sent two confirmation emails (with some shady outlook screenshot as pseudo proofs). I checked all my emails accounts and folders and never received two confirmations. Now my only possibility is to prove in some ways that my gmail account never received the first confirmation which is impossible to do. <br>Do not use this company, their system is simply not working properly. In case of issues you will be left on your own and forced to pay for their mistakes.<br>I have booked many flights online with many companies and never have I seen such problems occur."
81,Sharyn,4,"First time flying Vietnam Airlines.  Staff was friendly.  Organized boarding of the plane. Plane was clean, current and felt safe during entire journey.  No food was served as airline is not serving food on short flights in order to cut down on contamination due to the Novel Coronavirus of which we appreciated.  They did hand out individual bottles of water and hand wipe clothes.  Will fly Vietnam Airlines again and do recommend them."
81,tonyb43@virginmedia.com,3,Flight from Heathrow to Saigon delayed for 7 hours due to Customs carrying out spot check on aircraft. Once on board everything went well. Staff good and food reasonable. Overall good not a problem to travel with them again
81,Nick,4,"The flight itself was excellent. The cabin crew were exceptionally nice and attentive. The food was also very good even though it was just a short hop from Da Nang to HCM.<br><br>However, the domestic lounge in Da Nang is in serious need of an upgrade. The seats were filthy, full of marks and found food and used toothpicks between the cushions.<br><br>Not much food was on offer either, the coffee was literally just sugar.<br><br>Staff didn’t really do anything apart from stare at their phones the whole time. <br><br>I understand not much can be asked for when flying domestic, but this was really just unacceptable."
81,Chris S,4,"Have used VietnamAirlines for 4 internal flights over last 3 weeks and found then to be clean, comfortable, on time airline. Seating a little outdated but still comfortable. <br>Luggage service is excellent"
82,Ajarn Mark,1,"I can't believe that an airline charging so much money but they serve you only water and peanuts in the business class. They blame it on Coronavirus and it is really unacceptable. Here is their policy as per their email:<br><br>Inflight service: Vietnam Airlines will change many inflight services to maximize protection and ensure passengers’ health and safety.<br><br>Accordingly, the airline temporarily suspends meals for all flights of less than 2 hours and 30 minutes, serving only bottled spring water and packaged snacks for passengers who request it to limit contact with reusable items."
82,Dover56,1,Business class food and beverage is now a bottle of water and packet of nuts with no meal or any drink choice and no alcohol.  Staff claim it is to prevent corona virus.   Its obviously just a money saving technique by this terribly run airline.
82,heryandri,1,"I flew Vietnam Air on Feb 6, to Ho Chi Minh City at 14.40 from Cengkareng Airport Jakarta by VN 630 and I experienced very bad service from them. The aircraft was broken down so it was failured to fly. We waited inside the cabin more than 1 hour. Further, the captain asked us to get off the plane and back to the airport again. That was still okay, because engine/hydraulic system failed could be happened any time and anywhere. But, the inexperienced and bad service appeared after that. We waited in the lounge and it was announced that the plane will be departed at 21.00. Its already too long to wait, but still rather ok. Until  the nightmare came. The announcement board said that the gate we at 2C, so I went to the gate at 20.00, because it takes about 10 minutes to walk to the gate. Nobody knew about vietnam air at the gate. Later, the airline officer came and said we should be back to the lounge. They said that the plane is not ready and we should go to the hotel. How come? No announcement before. Waiting for 5 hours then went the hotel. They should predicted better by telling us before and brought us to the hotel earlier. We should bring our baggages that already checked in, waiting for the bus and again waiting and queueing to check in at the hotel, they did not well prepared, they should be distributed the room key directly to us, no need for check in anymore. Weve already tired to do it. Tomorrow morning at the airport again we should queueing and waiting at the gate for check in and got the boarding pass and dropping the baggage, actually they promised yesterday no check in anymore only dropping baggage. What a bad ground handling service!!! This is the first time I flew by Vietnam Air and no more, it was enough for very bad experienced."
82,Ron D,5,A comfortable flight with attentive flight attendants. This was our first flight on a Vietnamese domestic airline. There was more leg room than on US flights.
82,Craig C,3,"Whilst check in was a breeze and their baggage allowance was a generous 30kg (Changed shortly after I booked to 23kg) once on the flight there was little to recommend this as a preferred carries. The service was basic and delivered with little character or friendliness. I didn't eat the food as it arrived luke warm and as I had chosen the pork I didn't want to risk food poisoning although my wife ate the food and did not get sick.Finally their offerings for ""midnight snacks"" were less than appetising and restricted to nuts and the tiniest sandwiches I have ever come across!! Finally the leg room is typical of some asian carriers in that it does not cater for the average height of europeans. Will be looking for a different carrier on my next trip to Europe."
83,charlie,4,"Staff were friendly, food was highest quality among airline food, flight was on schedule.  In-flight entertainment options were extensive."
83,Foodie1947,5,"Our family group of 4 adults and one 8 year old child flew from Melbourne to Vietnam for Christmas and New Year. We had never flown with Vietnam Airlines previously so had no expectations. We were all pleasantly surprised with all the flights we took with this airline. We travelled in various classes from Economy on internal flights, Premium Economy from Melbourne to HCMC and Business from Vietnam to Sydney. All flights were very comfortable, the planes clean, food good. We don't have any special food requirements, so I guess that helps. The planes on the internal flights we took from Haiphong to DaNang and DaNang to HCMC were very comfortable and appeared quite new. Service was excellent on all flights and the Business flights were as good as most other Business experiences. I would not hesitate to use Vietnam Airlines again or recommend them to others."
83,trudy b,1,"When we tell them we are vegetarians we do not expect port to be served and when we pointed it out they simply shrugged.<br>At breakfast I was told there was no coffee, when others were given it I was given it begrudgingly. No,apologies, no,smiles. <br>Night time snack was stale.<br>We wrote to the airline and received no reply. Dreadful service for a lot of money"
83,Greg O,5,"First time flying Vietnam Airlines, and it won't be the last. Everything was great from the ground crew at check in to the flight itself. Food service was provided thou it was a short flight. Much better than most US carriers. The flight arrived over 30 minutes early. Vietnam airlines is now a skymiles airline, so an added bonus. In seat comfort was very good. I highly recommend this carrier."
83,Geoff T,4,Bit cramped but not as bad as BA. Great service and good food but could do with a few more film choices
84,Valma S,4,"due to cancelled flight from siem reap to ho chi minh, &amp; no flight to get to Melb I had to stayover at ho chi minh, I asked question to travel agent, do I need visa for vietnam, no, she said on advice from melb office Vietnam airlines. so check in at Luang prabang was stressful, no visa, no travel to vietnam, I was told. It was sorted but really I would have paid the usd $15 for vietnam landing visa to have kept my passport &amp; not felt like a criminal in Ho chi minh. Staff of vietnam airlines were great, it was the cancelled flight caused my stress, then advice re visa incorrect. I believe I saw my original flight on flight departure board from siem reap, so I guess i was easiest to bump for overbooked flight! i would not rush to fly with vietnam airlines again, from siem reap I got a glass of coke, 1hr flight, on equivalent bangkok airlines flight i got a full meal &amp; drinks. Have to say the hotel I stayed in Ho Chi Minh provided late night meal, but I had to insist on arrival for this. I had expected a meal during flight"
84,Thi Phuoc Lai N,2,I wrote to onlinesupport@vietnamairlines.com to change my flight schedules. They haven't replied since 03 days. <br>I called Vietnamairlines office in Bangkok. They are really incompetent. The operator asked me to hold on on phone for more than 5 minutes so I had to stop the call to avoid paying as I used mobile phone. Then I called  again at  least 4 times but no one answered the calls. <br><br>Until now I haven't been able to change my flight schedules.
84,Peter S,1,"I flew mostly with VN. <br><br>This time VN was fooling me. Due to the recent corona virus in China, VN airlines decided to suspend all flights to China. It is understandable. <br><br>On my day of departure from China to SGN it was known by VN that I can’t take the return flight back to China. No information on their website, no email information were given to me. <br><br>I got notice 1 day after arrival from the German news, about VN suspension flying to China. <br><br>If I would be informed on the day of starting my trip, I would have cancelled this trip. <br><br>Next day I spent 5 hours at BN HCM Ticket office to solve this matter. They didn’t got time for me. I was sourcing alternative options to reroute the ticket going back via Korea with VN and buying on my own costs a new ticket with KE to Shanghai. <br><br>VN Airlines asked me to pay for the flight changes extra USD 800 plus my own new needed expenses for a new ticket plus hotel costs in total USD 1.200. <br><br>I kindly asked them to solve this matter in a customer oriented way because they didn’t update their customer as it should be done, at least for their so called sky priority customers. <br><br>I went to the department manager but she was unable to manage her job. For sure she was overworked as I wasn’t alone with my problem. <br><br>After in total of wasting 5 hours time at VN, I left without solution and bought today a new air ticket with a different airline. <br><br>My losses are quite high. <br><br>The WHO stated earlier that as a result of the corona virus situation, that flights to China shouldn’t be stopped as it got no impact on the health situation. <br><br>It’s really strange to experience how VN Airlines is solving this challenge. The only reason for their decision making is commercially based as the customer demand for flights to China is decreasing. <br><br>The standard service for the flights, lounge and check in processes are good. <br><br>As a summary, I am feeling cheated by VN which will have an impact on my future flight decisions."
84,Gordon,5,Very good top class airlines. No complaints at all. Prices is incredible low so is no point to take bus or train.
84,Julie,3,"This is a cheap airline and the service was adequate, I would say that you get what you pay for ! We took a few flights around Vietnam - always at least 30 mins late boarding. Go ahead and use them but be mindful of delays."
85,helantero t,5,"was our first time travelling business class. excellent configuration of seats. we chose to have 2 seats in the middle. everyone gets an aisle seat. seats easy to operate, comfortable. food was ok but not great. if you think about food being able to be reheated in the microwave, then make choices around that. pate was not pate. salads were lacking. service was good though. nice to arrive refreshed."
85,Jojii2k,4,The staff from the counter were rude when I asked where can I check-in for the flight<br>only until someone noticed that i was a business class passenger and helped me with my flight<br>but apart from that services are generally 5 star worthy<br>thank you to the gentleman that helped me on VCL airport
85,Nhan Phan,3,"We need to refund 1 ticket for one of our family member. We called them, they refused to do it via phone and request us to send an email to them. We did, and we wait 1 day without answer so we call them again. They again refuse to do it via phone, and told us to wait because they have too many emails ??? I though the point of manage booking online is that you process your booking faster? Why you have phone service if you don't allow booking managing with phone?"
85,Klaus U,1,"Funny stuff, in the plane with a delay of 30 minutes, then they told us to leave the plane due to problems, but they couldn’t find an airport bus so we stayed in the plane. After that they could somehow fix the problems and we could leave with a 3 hours delay. In total 2 hrs before the departure at the airport, 3 hours wait for 1 hour flying time."
85,Tommy F,4,"I flew first with Vietnam airlines on a flight from Bangkok to Hanoi. I would give this flight 5/5. it was on time, served good food and the flight attendants were very nice and came around often to offer drinks. I can say for flights around south east Asia and Vietnam this airline is the best i encountered.<br><br>I have also flown on the London-Hanoi flight last June. The first leg to Hanoi was good, flight left on time and arrived early. Staff were nice, food was good and i had no issue with the seating (i'm 6'2). <br>However the return leg had a delay of over 3 hours. While delays happen the annoying thing was no one explained why there was a delay and the time for the delay kept increasing. I realize delays happen but it would have been better if they informed passengers as to why they are delays as people were beginning to worry if the flight was cancelled. Anyway the advantage of the extra wait meant i was exhausted when i got on the plane and fell asleep before take off and by the time i woke up we were going over Germany ,so i'll take the pluses from it.<br>Overall a very good airline and what you would expect from a national carrier"
86,Sandra C,3,Vietnam airlines Dreamliner was anything but. It was very cramped and seats were really uncomfortable. Food was average and service not very friendly. Flight ran to schedule on the way there but was late on the return flight. Internal flights were also delayed. <br>I chose this airline as it was direct to Vietnam but would go with another carrier next time.
86,TravelAllOver_12,1,"Seats were uncomfortable with virtually no legroom, announcements inaudible, entertainment sporadic with lousy audio, poor service. Having travelled on many airlines  over a number of decades, this is probably the worst."
86,Ginnyleeinwonderland,4,"I book my tickets directly from their website so I can choose my seat. I chose aisle seat because it was very comfortable for me. Check-in on the website was available 24 hours before flight so I checked in on the website before going to the airport. That was vert convenient. Also, if you don't have check-on baggage, it will save a lot of time. Legroom was comfortable. Flight attendants were very friendly but I wish they didn't walk like angry giants step on floor. From Hanoi to Singapore, food was delicious although I didn't like the dessert because it was too sweet and I guess they made it with some beans. I had an allergy to peanut and their snack was roasted peanuts. I didn't see any place to add special requests on their website so that was kind of inconvenient for me. For the flight back to Hanoi, food was not delicious but dessert was yummy."
86,Jim M,3,"Although punctual, the food was at best mediocre. But provision of liquids was really poor. With a 3 hour check in, the airport water facilities were not available (having had to dispose of fluids to get through security). VA seemed keener to offer a face wipe than a glass of water. A few hours into the flight a small bottle of water was offered to go with the small juices and cups of tea offered with the meal.<br>Alcoholic offerings were even more skimpy. <br>Comfort was only average for a 14 hour economy seat<br>VA are the only direct carrier from London to Hanoi and Saigon. If another was available I would use it."
86,AlisonD,4,The airline was great - cant fault it.  We did upgrade which was nice.  The food and the staff were lovely.  Never flown with this airline but definitely recommend them.
87,Middy,1,"Where to begin? Seats broken, Service extremely poor, every request felt a bit like asking for a favour; seat recliners broken but no-one cares; on board entertainment didn't load until 3 hours into 12 hour flight. On top of that, customer service just doesn't care. Never again, plenty other much better Airlines to chose from."
87,Perry H,4,Very good flight and more leg room than most Asian airlines. Very clean and great staff. I was very satisfied. The food was good and better than some. They are a good choice and I have flew many airlines and recommend them over many other options
87,Dr Saad SHAMA,3,Travel time at 1:30 pm then departure at 3pm without any notice . Craft is ok as any airline and the price normal as any international company but without any advantage. At the gate we crowded without enough seats to passengers .
87,Anthony Hunter,5,"Most on time Airlines in Vietnam. Quiet, good service, safe and smooth. Most important thing is it always on time, if not a litle bit early. Highly recommend"
87,KianHian L,1,"It is not cheap to travel this airline if u have extra luggage with the 2nd baggage policy. Have a bad experience last October 2019. I had two check in baggage was charged per kilo basis for the 2nd baggage which cost me more than the ticket price of the whole trip return. I had misinterpreted it and thought it will be charged per kilo basis after the 30kg free with the ticket. Furthermore my first baggage was only 19kg not exceeding the free check in baggage but was Vietnam Airline select to charged the 2nd baggage base on the heaviest of the two though the banner at check-in counter said the promotion for 50% 2nd baggage and was told not  applicable for extra large baggage. At the check-in take me more than 1 hour because the ground staff do not understand the policy, wait for them to call everywhere to checked. For my returned trip and I bought a new ticket with AirAsia with the extra large baggage still cheaper than the just the 2nd  baggage charged of Vietnam Airline. So vietnam airline is not a good choice with the new 2nd baggage policy lauching in August 2019."
88,Hanh Van Pham,5,"Another great experience with Vietnam Airlines. This time I pre-ordered the special seafood meal. It was so tasty with plenty of seafood to eat. What made it even better is that, people with special meals ordered are served first. The flight was on-time, flight attendants were friendly, and a movie were shown during the flight on the shared screen (we don't have private inflight entertainment as it is a short flight on A321). But there are no reasons to complain about it."
88,Erdem T,2,I was buying ticket from da nang to ho chi minh in Haiphong airport.Costumer service told me that if there is no delay you can departure on time.<br>But when we came to the airport its delay for no reason and staff explained nothing
88,epruuu,5,It was very nice to fly from UK to Vietnam directly. Staffs were kind and helpful. The only think they confuse halal and vegetarian meal.
88,blue p,1,"Different flights ( 9am,10am,11am etc.) to various cities were opened for check in at the same row at the same time, causing a big crowd to be jammed there.<br>Also took about 10 mins for check in for each person, extremely slow.<br>Flights were also delayed for 3 hours and 1 hour on both occasions.<br>In flight, they don't bother to check/guide. Asking for menu to have a look before take off was a struggle, attendants did not even bothered to take a few extra steps."
88,Kumi Bella,1,"They changed my flight and charged me a fee for it. Complained to customer service by calls and emails and all they said was “one of our senior will be in touch” but they never did. Flight itself was really bad too. Aircraft was very old , toilet was filthy , they didn’t have water to wash hands with etc.... very long and painful flight. Never recommend then and I will never fly with them."
89,Ebony P,3,I had booked internal flights to save us time<br>on our 2 week trip to Vietnam rather than opt for overnight buses and trains. Not the best flight experience as we were delayed on all 3 of our internal flights. Most of the other airlines seemed to be running on time. On the first flight we had been moved to a different flight and told there were delays. We were at the airport for a further 2 hours. The flight we were originally scheduled on still departed. Seat selection one of our flights didn’t correspond with the aircraft seating. Our boarding didn’t correspond with  the times that we were informed through information screens at the gate.
89,Tiffomuffin,4,I must say this airline surprised me because I never flew long haul with them before and I didn’t have high expectations. I flew Jakarta - Ho Chi Minh - Frankfurt return and all my 4 flights were on time. <br><br>Staff were friendly and are happy to accommodate your needs. For the long haul flight they give you plenty of drinks and even bottled water so you are never dehydrated. If you are still hungry you can ask for small snacks and cup noodles. They also provide slippers on the plane which I like as I don’t have to walk around in my shoes. <br><br>The plane for Jakarta to Ho Chi Minh did not provide individual in-flight entertainment though so it’s pretty boring. All their meals were good and the price is on the cheaper side compared to other premium airlines flying the same route. They also give you 30 kg baggage allowance for economy which I find very generous. You can’t do online or self check in though which is quite annoying. But overall it’s a good experience and I would definitely fly with them again.
89,alexandru,1,"Flight booked on 08.01.2020 canceled for technical reasons and passengers directed by taxi from Can Tho to Saigon (4 hours) and flight from Saigon th Phu Quoc. Instead of reaching destination in one hour we spent almost 8 hours and lost one day of our vacation.<br>Upon reviewing the event, only max 20 passengers were redirected like this which suggests that the real reason is the company decided it was cheaper to cancel the flight and redirect passengers, rather than fly and empty plane....<br>At our specific request, no paper was issued to confirm our flight cancellation and rikets for the substitute flight were issued only on Saigon Airport, just before boarding so we had no proof and no time to claim compensation...."
89,stephenchan,4,"First time to try the Vietnam airlines to Ho Chi Minh. Travelled with business class, and  the fare is competitive. Food is so-so, but general speaking it is quite comfortable."
89,GasconySeismic,4,"I travelled in premium economy - my partner in business. Paris - Hanoi - Sydney. Equipment is first rate, either A350 Europe to Vietnam, B787 onward. All on time. In premium, 787 has much more room than the 350 which is almost economy space. Service is mixed: overall courteous and attentive but seems to vary between legs: Sydney - Hanoi was positively grumpy. On board it can be a little haphazard: it's possible to horizontally sleep through landing in Hanoi in business, which I'd find pleasant."
90,ExVotoFatum,3,"Ok but room to improve <br>Staff friendly and helpful, no coffee , beer or wine served due to short time according to crew. No inflight entertainment. Poor food.<br>Room to improve"
90,ExVotoFatum,4,"Pro: spacious legroom and seat decline, really better to all I have seen before <br>Food good, wine served good, service good, entertainment good<br>Con: 20 Minutes delayed, no announcement for people waiting 30 min and more for boarding <br>Not enough water serving during 12 hour flight <br>Pricy for appr 1500 US Dollar <br>But Worth the money"
90,Andrew N,4,"No flight delay for our flight.<br>Check in takes a bit longer than expected, check in staff was not flexible enough to move economy passengers to Business check in to fast track the check in until there is a long queue (even though there was no Business check in passenger)<br>Travelling on Vietnam airlines was comfortable and smooth. <br>I would like to commend cabin crew on route from Van Don to Saigon, they are very friendly and helpful and would attend to passenger as soon as request light in ON.<br>Service with a smile.<br>What about food service?. Food was good and choices available to passengers. Food taste was good too.<br>Overall we can not fault the service on board."
90,I. T.,3,"Choose this airline as it is a direct flight from CGK to SGN .  As mentioned it is average. Seats do not have the best comfort, food served is so so. Limited choice of drinks. English of cabin crew is not the best . Have to listen very careful to understand what is announced"
90,Dharman H,5,"On our recent trip to Hanoi, Saigon, Siem reap and Luan Prabang we used Vietnam airlines . They were courteous and ever willing to accommodate any request.<br>On our most recent flight they checked our luggage through to Boston via JAL and the woman who met us in Hanoi took excellent care to make sure our bags were taken care of - we didn’t need a transit visa because the woman in Luan Prabang went out of her way to make sure it could be interlined.<br>Thank you Vietnam air - I am a executive club member of American Airlines but you put the America. airlines to shame when it comes to service <br>Keep up the great work - when are you flying to Boston ?"
91,Ash,1,"We have flown with Vietnam airways 6 times over 16 days during our Vietnamese holiday. Every flight we have taken has been delayed, staff have been extremely unhelpful and haven’t explained clearly what has been going on. Not enjoyable to fly with an unreliable airline."
91,Jessica D,1,"We took 4 planes with VietNam airlines all were delayed of a least 1 hour (without any information). <br>They took more than 24h hours to reply to an email. <br>Service on board was poor (someone vomit on the floor and they just put a towel on it, not enough meal for everyone : all chicken was taken so only one choose left, and the worst was the screen to watch movies : tactile was not working and really poor sound coming in the ear plug). <br>Anyway we are in 2020, they should renew their planes, their policy and they staff (which does not speak English at all)."
91,An N,1,"worst airline ever, worst services. They always want to ask you to buy more services and did not support their client"
91,Deb K,2,The flight was delayed <br>We finally boarded from the back <br>Overhead was too small for many bags but under seat storage was huge<br>No air conditioning or breeze from fans the entire flight. Service was a choice of water or nothing<br>Oh well <br>At least we landed safely- with a thud
91,HouAzn Traveler,2,"Booked a flight with them on line. Followed instructions and paid including luggage. At check in, the agent asked why we didn't buy pre-paid return luggage. We told them we did. She told us that we only purchased one way. She said that it had been an issue and confusing to many customers. She said to contact the travel desk. The travel desk said it happened a lot and was only like $30 each piece, but we had to contact the desk in Hanoi. In Hanoi the story changed from it happened a lot, to it was my fault for not booking right, One agent even proceeded to show me on line where I went wrong. That didn't end well as the site showed buying prepaid luggage but said nothing about having to purchase it both ways individually. That agent then refused to talk to me and referred me to her manager. He was rude and kept telling me what the computer said, and would hear nothing about the website being confusing, or perhaps designed to add unexpected charges. I agreed to pay for the return luggage and that went to $50 per piece. I asked for the contact at their corporate office, or a phone number, I was told they did not have a contact or phone !! I am convinced this is done on purpose as it seems odd that the agents would know to tell you that you only purchased one way luggage at check in. VERY SLEEZY AND DISHONEST !!  All the costs added, this was a rip off."
92,Nerissa S,5,"Vietnam Airlines was brilliant.  Loads of leg room, food was gorgeous, staff were wonderful, inflight entertainment, overall cannot say a bad word."
92,David W,4,"Great flight, excellent entertainment and poor food.  They are a one trick pony when it comes to the food service.  However, the food was Luke warm by 5he time it was served.  Top tip, eat before you fly."
92,Jeff R,5,"Helpful, efficient crew. We travel with bicycles and they were counted as one of our ""checked"" bags as long as the weight is under 50 lbs. The USA domestic airlines need to take a lesson!"
92,ChristopheRL75,5,Flight from Saigon to Siem Reap.<br>Aprox 1 hours flight from Saigon.<br>Excellent airplane.<br>Good and efficient service
92,Martin L,1,"Have flown many times, first class to economy. I thought I would pay a bit more money to fly premium economy but was I wrong. On the was from Hanoi to Frankfurt was delayed 3 1/2 hours.<br>From Frankfurt to Hanoi delayed 1 1/2 hours. The cabin was noisy. 2 kids one infant maybe 3 year old cried nearly the entire flight. Another 8 year old from the same family running up and down the aisle hitting peoples seats. Complained to the steward who said there is nothing he could do. Not worth the money. Better fly other airlines in economy class. It felt like a children's playground."
93,Daniel,4,Vietnam Airlines is Vietnams flag carrier and is decant. I was flying onboard there Airbus A321-231 and the seats were comfortable and the Cabin Crew were friendly. The food was the best food I have ever had on an airline in economy it was just spectacular. Overall I had a great flight.
93,Claire,4,"Overall, it was a good flight. Check-in lines were super long, but there was enough staff at the counters to process everyone in a timely fashion. Thank goodness, because there were two other sets of long lines at the airport (immigration and security). No entertainment to speak of on board. Food was OK. What I loved, was that the flight was on time, and even landed 15 minutes early. You cannot beat that!"
93,JLFLeeds,2,Lost my main luggage on flight of less than an hour 19kg for 3 weeks in Vietnam. Customer services polite but ineffective 8 days later they still can’t locate my luggage and have refused me an upgrade on my internal flights HCM to Danang and Hue to Hanoi as a gesture of goodwill. All communication is by email. Siem Reap checkin failed to give me a baggage receipt for carriage of checked in international luggage.
93,Jack C,5,Really enjoyed the flight from Melbourne to HCMC. The service was outstanding as was the food and drink. The staff could not be more friendlier or efficient. Our seats were extremely comfortable and made the whole experience one that I am more than happy to do again. They use the Airbus A350 which is a great plane to fly on.
93,KLG,5,The flight was pleasant. Reading materials were adequate. Seats were cozy. Flight attendants were pleasant.
94,Gary_Childers,4,"Plane departed and arrived on time, luggage turned up and the crew were pleasant, so all the elements of a good flight were there. As this is a full service airline the snack offered on the flight was also of a high standard and the aircraft was clean and well presented. Would fly on this airline again."
94,MiR_FoodExplore,5,Plane is clean. Flight attendants are friendly.<br><br>Flight was on time. Definitely the best domestic airlines.
94,juliejeffusmauldin,5,We were on a quick flight to Hanoi and the service and food was excellent!! Flight attendants as usual are beautiful!!!Flight was on time and super amazing!! <br>I really wish our US airlines would learn from out of country airlines how to have awesome service and beautiful flight attendants.
94,37421kittyw,5,this was a good plane.<br>the food was not the best but it was food<br> the fligh was short and it was well worth it but i might suggest have the  e visa if you can and need it....
94,Max,3,"Uncomfortable seats, 9 hours between meals (on a 12 hour flight) and an in flight entertainment system that broke down more than an alcoholic in rehab. <br><br>Not great but the plane was very clean and the staff did smile."
95,mps d,5,"Flew Vietnam Airways on a flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Min City Airport.  Well the flight though a short one decided to go in for a full fare Business Class ride considering the fare difference between Y and J class was hardly anything.  Decided to spoil myself and experience flying luxury as the online booking site claimed full flat bed seats, and extra leg room.  <br><br>On boarding the aircraft was pretty saddened as it was an oder equipment being used with the traditional reclining seats with nothing as promised. <br><br>However the in-flight service was great and Couldnt complain. The crew were accommodating and the snacks delicious.  <br><br>The lounge facility too offered at the Changi airport was pretty gorgeous. I would certainly recommend flying Vietnam Airways,  but just hope the equipment used on routes are as promised."
95,Khaalid,2,My flight was short but i sat in Business Class. My seat could not work. I was told its not a problem. Cabin Crew English was extremely poor. I asked for a second cup of white tea and business class crew was unprofessional and rude. Horrible experience. If i pay for business class I expect to get what im paying for.
95,Dinesh N,5,"I lost my personal belonging (dropped it on the seat inside the airplane) while I was in transit. I’ve reported that to the lost and found department (arrival lounge) The officer who was attending the lost and found counter called the staff who were doing the maintenance of the plane at that time and confirmed the item was found. I had to catch my next flight in the next 1/2 hour so I could not stay to collect the item. But, he got my contact email address and name in order to arrange the delivery to the Phu Quoc airport. <br><br>I would like to give my personal thanks to Mr Vu Hoang for his effort to transfer the item to Phu Quoc airport. Thank you again.<br><br>I really like the customer service of Vietnam airlines ( in flight as well as airport staff). The only place we had some trouble was the time taken by airport customs. The lines were so long and took almost couple of hours from joining the line and getting the visa stamped. We paid around extra $200 (USD) to get priority service but end up with the same queue as everyone else. <br><br>I think it’s something Vietnam should be improving in order to retain the good reputation of their airline. Also displaying proper signs in the airport (Ho Chi Minh) so tourists will not get disoriented would be nice as well."
95,Cherita G,5,"Good service.  It was an economy seat, so it was basic.  The seats weren't bad, a lot like flying Southwest Airlines.  There aren't a lot of choices within Vietnam, but this economy airline fits the bill."
95,C Yeo,4,"First time flying with Vietnam Airlines. It was an enjoyable experience. Service is great and food menu is satisfying. Probably because we are sitting at the emergency exit, the seat and leg space is comfortable too. Only lacks the in-flight entertainment. The rest are good."
96,wes d,5,"Upon checking in ready for boarding the staff with their big smile and gesture of welcome on board, since the staff is all smiling and it reflects upon the passengers too with our big smile as well as we line up to find our seat.  The 3 + hrs. flight from Taipei To HCm city the service could be described in a few words professional, courtesy, and friendly with a big smile.  I myself just sat back and enjoy the carefree ride to HCM city for a big tour of central Vietnam."
96,siska sari,4,"when i was traveling in Vietnam December 2019, I always use this airline. the flight is punctual, the food is good, the coffee also taste good. as it is not a budget airline, the legroom is also quite spacious."
96,Sirapong Thanapornchaisin,4,I forgot my mobile in the toilet at Danang airport during transit to Tokyo. So we already thought that we lost it. On the way back to Bangkok from Osaka we again transit at Danang airport and when we arrived at the airport so we try to find lost and found department at the airport but there is no lost and found or information at the airport. So we go to the Lotus lounge and requested the staffs to help us to find our mobile phone.<br>This gentleman from Lotus lounge is very helpful. He called to lost and found department and also took us to the security to find our mobile. <br>Finally we got our mobile back. Thanks a lot for the kindness of the airline staffs .
96,Keiji H,1,"Both legs of my Hanoi - Ho Chi Minh flights were delayed, and at Ho Chi Minh we were not allowed to check in till quite late and were made to wait at the check in rows."
96,Keiji H,1,"At the gate they suddenly announced the flight would be delayed by 15 minutes, which became 1.5 hours delay without any reason given."
97,Uyen,4,"I was skeptical after flying on a budget airlines to Phuket, Thailand. We had flown Jetstar.That was a miserable experience with the whole lining up all at once. Our flight was delayed like 7 hours. <br><br>So having a positive experience on Vietnam Airlines was uplifting. The food and drinks, of course, you had to pay for on the plane. It was a quick two hour flight and the landing was better than American Airlines to Belize. Good job, Vietnam Airlines. Keep it up."
97,Taylor W,3,We took two domestic flights with this airline. Both delayed. Service and seats comfortable. We flew economy. No inflight entertainment or food. Good baggage allowances.
97,Dave L,5,"A great flight with excellent service and good food for an in flight meal. The air hostesses were very helpful and efficient. Dreamliner plane, over 12 hour flight, all smooth, departed and arrived on time. Check in all good,"
97,Amy L,4,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines on a very short flight (&lt;1 hour) from Siem Reap to Luang Prabang.  Overall experience is positive:  easy to make online reservation directly on airline's website, check-in and boarding went smoothly, flight left on time and arrived early, staff were courteous and professional.<br><br>Despite the short flight, the crew managed to distribute snack boxes within 30 minutes.  This effort alone is commendable and exceeds the standards of many other airlines.  The snack box, though, was not too appetizing -- a small chicken-like sandwich with water.  I skipped it in hope of getting dinner in town upon arrival.  Improving the food option would be my only suggestion to the airline.<br><br>In contrast to most Asian carriers, though, Vietnam Airlines does have a very generous  policy for hand luggage -- 12 kg!.  This new policy just went into effect in late 2019, which I was happy to discover and took the opportunity to carry on my bag (9 kg - usually not allowed for airlines limiting to 7 kg).  This is a stress-saver for me given my extensive travel."
97,Ada C,3,"The check in experience was ok but when we were on board, we realised that the seating arrangement was different from the online check in. So at the end, we shifted to middle and window seat :(<br>The food was just eatable and they only served water or coke during the domestic flight."
98,Nelson L,5,"Travelled from Melbourne to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh city for our family holiday in December. Great service, food was good and the plane was new. Only recommendation to any traveler is to allow around 4 hours to get your visa stamped, through immigration, luggage claim and get to the other domestic terminal."
98,Rebecca R,4,"Nothing out of the ordinary flying out of Sydney. The usual really for an economy seat. Hosts polite, but not overly attentive. Instructions for safety were pretty blase and the overhead speaker system to listen to instruction was barely audible. Inflight food was nothing special, you only eat it if you are super hungry as it isn't the best, lets be honest. Food had the obvious Asian influence as that's the way we were headed. <br>However, I always find a difference when flying ex Asia, on any airline from any Asian country. I also find this true of cruising. When flying back to Australia on the same airline, the service was much more attentive. Crew seemed to have a more professional approach. Food was slightly better standard. It's more to do with the service though. I have found the flights ex Australia to be behind in service levels. Almost as if it's expected that Aussies are so laid back that going the extra mile or being extremely polite to patrons isn't necessary. When leaving from Hanoi it was very different to flying in. Hosts were so much more polite and attentive, food was slightly better, blankets and slipper packs were already on our seat. <br>I'm only mentioning this as I seem to find this all the time when travelling. When leaving other countries (except UK, which is on par with leaving Australia), I always get the feeling the hosts and level of food/drinks/accessories are much better than when leaving Australia.<br>This being said, Vietnam Airlines were good value for money and they flew direct from Australia to where I wanted to go, so that is a bonus for me as I don't like wasting time with the travel time when going on a holiday."
98,Cathy B,2,"Disappointed, to sum it up.<br><br>My siblings and I bought my really hardworking dad a ticket to Vietnam, his first holiday and trip back to his home country in 20 years.<br><br>Travelling alone, we wanted to make it as easy and pleasant as possible booking it with Vietnam airlines.<br><br>We should have listened to other people’s warnings about this airline.<br><br>Dad got to Vietnam and was waiting to collect his luggage at Tan Son Nhan airport. Waiting, waiting and his luggage never came.... went to find out what was wrong and they said it’s back in Australia.... not compensating him or anything, made him go without his luggage for 3 days and come back to the airport to collect it (few hours drive away from his home town). Absolutely ridiculous!<br><br>The least they could’ve done was deliver it to him or compensate him for some clothes for those few days!!!<br><br>Dad also stated it happened to two other people. He also stated food was terrible and flight was uncomfortable.<br><br>Giving them 4 stars for being able to do the job of getting him there and home. Will never recommend Vietnam Airlines or fly with them."
98,Tal C,1,"We just got to our hotel from the airport and my wife's bag was opened and $3,000 of jewelry was stolen. They left the bag open and empty. Never happened to us in any airline we ever flew. Beware of this airline!"
98,Manish1967,4,"the staff were courteous and efficient, and the flight took off on time and in flight service was efficient as well"
99,Johnfrisbee,3,"We flew Vietnam Airlines to/from Vietnam.<br>Although we'd forgotten to reserve our seats online until there were no two seats together, the check-in staff at Heathrow moved our seats without us asking. Big thanks for that.<br>Crew were friendly throughout, (even when rushed off their feet), and food was good, although our preferred options on the flight back had run out.<br>The in-flight entertainment was fine - enough content to last us both 12-hour flights.<br>Of course, with 12-hour night flights, the place was a mess at the end, what with blankets, luggage, food wrappers, etc. But that's normal in economy I think.<br>Soft drinks or water for rehydration were always on offer, and we liked the coloured dimming cabin lights to help sleep.<br>Cabin info was fine, and the flights were smooth and incident-free, although our return flight take-off was delayed by 2 hours.<br>We'd not hesitate to fly Vietnam again..."
99,Alex,1,"I had a very bad experience with Vietnam airlines. First of all, they don't provide baggage transfer if you are traveling joint fly. In my case it was Phu Quock - Ho Chi Minh - Singapore. Second and most important if you are traveling with somebody you can't join your baggage limits. I have travelled with my wife from ho chi minh to Singapore, so we had 20+20kg baggage limit. Our baggage was 30 kg in one bag and they force us to split our one bag to two bags which weight don't exceed 20kg. The funny thing is that for the same day flight from Phu Quock to ho chi min they allowed to join our limits and we had no problem."
99,Yann P,3,"Flight delayed without information<br>Very good takeoff<br>Landing (a big moment), we jumped on the runway without apologies from the captain<br>Very friendly and helpful crew<br><br>Modern and new aircraft"
99,Yann P,3,"I booked on line with seats selection (family trip), at the check in desk, we were separated in the plane<br><br>When I requested the reason, hostess kept silence, no explanation &amp; answer, no apology, guest service very poor. <br>She talked only in vietnamese. communication complicated with foreigners<br><br> Fly ticket VERY expensive during Christmas &amp; New Year<br><br>One positive point, new plane A321neo (comfortable)"
99,Dan,1,I will not use this airline again for domestic flights !  Checkin in person stickily changed my seat after I had paid for an aisle seat!  Guest service person pretended to not understand English when I switched to Vietnamese she said she couldn’t change my ticket as I need to send an email to request a change. Really? Never seen an airline so lacking in customer service training and employees continue to work as unmotivated civil servants.
100,LACToronto,5,"We flew from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City, the flight was comfortable and on time we had no issues at all and would recommend this airline."
100,Laura W,3,My bag was delayed for 20 hours and i felt the ground staff did not handle the matter efficiently. The customer service officer at Nha Trang called HCMC side a few times but his calls were not taken until much later 30 min.
100,ExVotoFatum,4,"On this short 1 :20 min flight crew was super friendly. They serve a blox which contains peanuts wrapped in Plastic and wafers packed in plastic and so on, <br>This should be changed,"
100,ExVotoFatum,3,"Second time on domestic flight, second time delay, 90 Minutes. <br>Despite that staff was friendly and handled situation."
100,olivia e,1,"We attempted to check in for our flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Siem Reap flight on 31.12.19 scheduled at 4pm. Which was withheld due to  Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air incompetence and lack of service.<br><br>My partner Mr S was requested to pass a checklist at the check in counter. He checked off all items noted on your checklist, 6 month validation of passport, Cambodia visa which was issued by the Cambodian embassy in Australia, proof of a onward ticket to Bangkok and Sydney, Vietnam visa, other visas Australian PR and USA, proof of $1,000 USD, hotel booking in Siem Reap and onward destinations etc. <br><br>PLEASE NOTE: the country (Uganda) is not noted on the list and should not have been questioned or raised to immigration. (See image attached of checklist). <br><br>Mr S is travelling with 3 Australians his fiancé, mother in law and father in law. He is an Australia permanent resident and has lived in Australia for 4 years and is currently awaiting citIzenship. He is a highly skilled engineer and he has no reason to stay in Cambodia past the 3 days holiday. Mr S should not have to pass these checklist items as his country is not required on the list. Vietnam airlines was denying us to fly no reason.<br><br>Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air supervisor sent Mr S information off to Cambodian immigration via text message and advised we only had a Visa card and did not have enough US dollars this was completely incorrect. We had plenty of money in our bank accounts (4 wealthy passengers) and if we were told we needed to physically show $1,000 USD in cash we could have easily done this to prove our right to enter Cambodia.<br><br>Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air supervisor did not request this from us and kept pushing us to the side and ignoring us and checking in other passengers. We asked her multiple times what she needed to see from us and she said wait there ... no further explanation was provided she just kept pushing us to the side we waited for 2 hours and then she said you are rejected. She made no effort to explain the situation, she did not ask the right the questions or tried to gain the correct information from us before proceeding to text message immigration.<br><br>Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air check in supervisor had clearly made up her mind the moment we arrived at check in that she would not allow us to fly so she sent the wrong information to ensure we didn’t. She is a racist, extremely rude and provided the most disgusting customer service we have ever experienced.<br><br>We requested to speak with management 3 times and she ignored our request I then had to scream at her which is something I did not want to do to get management to come and speak with us they finally came 15 mins before our flight was due to take off. Once they arrived at the check in counter they proceeded to provide just as poor service and were laughing over the situation. <br><br>Management then proceeded to tell us we were too late and we would miss the flight and not get a refund as it was immigrations fault not Vietnam airlines. Once Mr E stepped in and was given the time to explain what happened  with the manager (Tran Thi Hoang Anh) they then realised that the supervisor had made a mistake and requested more documentation which we provided to send onto immigration. <br><br>Vietnam airlines management advised the reason we have sent your information to immigration is because we do not wish to have to pay to send you back to Vietnam if your are denied in Cambodia as we have had a Ugandan before be denied. Mr S is not that past Ugandan he is his own person and has his own human rights it is not Vietnam’s airlines right to decide whether he travels to another country or not. It is Cambodia’s choice to let him in at the border or not. (Pre authorised Cambodian visa was issued by the embassy prior to travel) <br><br>Then once our further information and explanation was texted by Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air manager to Cambodian immigration and not the incompetent supervisor .....Surprise!!! Mr S was approved by immigration.<br><br>After 2 hours of stress and severe lack of care from the airline, staff then provided no assistance to help us make our flight on time we had to run to our flight and exhaust ourselves to make the plane on time with no help or fast track through customs from the Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air team. <br><br>When we arrived in Cambodia Mr S was NOT interrogated or placed in a room for questioning we simply entered the country freely. <br><br>Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air checklist at the check in counter does not state Uganda as a country of concern therefore we should not have been put through this stress the airline should be ashamed of the lack service provided and attention to care.<br><br>We are still yet to receive an apology from Vietnam airlines/ Cambodia Angkor Air.<br><br>We will never fly this airline again and we would suggest anyone else travelling through Vietnam to fly another airline also."
101,Eero N,4,We came from Moscow to Hanoi and then Da Nang. Vietnamese Airline worked very well. Good airplanes and service. I will choose again Vietnamese Airline.<br>Only taxi driver charged 400000VTD in Hanoi int airpot to domestic. That sounds heavy. We rented a good car with driver 700000 VTD for 6 hours in Da Nang.
101,sebide,1,"I experienced despicable and demeaning behaviour on NYE at the Hoh Chih Minh airport. Your attendance staff for the flight to Siem Reap were rude, racist and disrespectful to me and my family. Your customer service is poor and you show no concern and any help. All your staff did was spread lies and misinformation pass on the responsibility to the higher ups and smile. If it wasn’t for the support of other people flying with me I wouldn’t have flown and gotten to my destination. This behaviour was applied to other people flying as well and it was overall a demeaning experience for everyone on the flight. Shame on Vietnam airlines staff and the whole organisation for your behaviour during this whole traumatic experience on NYE. <br>Instead of convincing people to sign up for lotus smiles how about you focus on customer service and do the basics stuff.<br><br>Mr  CEO DUONG TRI THANH if you truly believe in your organisation to be the best airline and to greater heights in 2020<br> then take ownership and train your front office staff to do better or hire people who want to work for you. Your ambitions will be derailed if your front office staff are behaving like this all the time. #poorcustomerservice #rude #airlinefromhell #<br><br>Below are pictures of the airline staff who conveniently remembered to not understand a word of English I was saying and could only speak in Vietnamese and refused to allow us to speak to their supervisor."
101,gfarr92,5,I've just come back from Vietnam. Had direct international flights from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi to Heathrow as well as a few internal flights. <br><br>I booked my flights on SkyScanner using a company called TravelUp. Everything went smoothly beforehand and I was able to use their online check in 24 hours before on the Vietnam Airlines app with ease for both flights. <br><br>I only had hand luggage on the way out (31L rucksack and I bought a suitcase in Hanoi for my return) I found the check in desks very quick not too much waiting time and the staff at the desks were friendly and helpful very efficient. Again very efficient at the boarding gate although they did call my name out as well as a few other tourists as I had checked in online and didn't visit the check in desk on the outbound flight they gave us a paper ticket and just wanted to check our visas were valid before we travelled therefore I'd suggest if you are only taking hand luggage to still visit the check in desk to avoid any minor panic before hand! <br><br>The flight out from Heathrow left at 11am GMT and arrived in SGN around 7am Vietnamese time. I found the timings of the flight difficult to adjust I didn't get any sleep not through any fault of VA just myself being unable to adjust. The seats were comfy plenty of leg room. I didn't think much of the entertainment service on the screens the choice wan't great I'd suggest pre downloading your own entertainment to get you through the flight. There's no Wifi on this route. The meals were served towards the start and end of the flight plus snacks in between. The quality of the meals was excellent especially the Asian cuisine. You could ask for further service and snacks if you were still feeling hungry or thirsty. Toilets were regularly checked and very clean.<br><br>The flight time on my return from Hanoi was a lot better it left Hanoi at 01:35 and arrived at Heathrow approx 08:00 which meant I was able to treat the day before as a normal full day and make myself tired so I could sleep on the plane. This was aided by the flight from Hanoi being half empty there were so many spare seats including the two next to me in the middle section therefore I could pull up the arm rests and lay across with extra pillows and blankets for comfort. I must've slept for about 5-6 hours of the flight which was perfect for me.   <br><br>I've flown with Thai Airways before and whilst I'd say that Thai Airways is probably slightly above in terms of the plane spec they fly VA isn't too far behind the customer service was excellent.<br><br>I'll definitely visit Vietnam again and will have no hesitation is using VA again in the future.
101,Angeline,3,"Food is nice and not too bad. However, service counter at Hanoi airport could be improved to reduce the long queue.   Overall, good for short distant trip."
101,Susan L,4,"It's our very first time took Vietnam Airlines to Hanoi &amp; Dalat Vietnam. It is easy to book online, value for money (as we book 6 months ahead), great customer service. They allowed check-in as a group. Total 6 of us. Friendly passenger service agent both in Spore &amp; Vietnam airports, satisfied in-flight food. Local Vietnamese &amp; Chinese food served. Boarding on time &amp; safe. Will travel again with Vietnam Airlines in futures."
102,Hansolo76sg,4,The best feature of this airline is the legspace is incredible. i think its at least 10cm more than typical economy flights. The service was adequate with good and fuss free response. Much to improve would be to give out headsets asap so that passengers can start settling down with entertainment. The worst experience is the terrible transit in Ho Chin Minh where all transit passengers have to queue to be scanned at ONE xray machine.
102,Prings245,1,This is the second time I’ve flown Vietnam airlines and the second time @ BKK airport it takes circa 30 mins to drop bags for web check in. Their process for dealing with issues is poor and most passengers are asked to unpack or go to another counter to pay and then re queue. <br><br>Lastly even though we checked in online the lady behind the counter still was manually checking us in which takes another 16 mins...like seriously VN airlines get a grip! Seriously not good!!!
102,Heidi D,5,"Vietnam Airlines is an excellent airline with great legroom, friendly attendees, and offering food &amp; drink, even on short flights.  I was impressed with their efficiency and professionalism."
102,Merv&amp;Jenn,4,"First of all, Vietnam Airlines is a good carrier, we flew few times domestically during our two weeks stay in VN. Most flights were short; less than 1.5 hours. Downside to short flights are no F&amp;B services :-(<br><br>From HCM to BKK, we didn't realized the code-sharing thingy ... didn't actually fly VNA but Jetstar Pacific ..Hahaha, bummer! thought been downgraded to budget airline.."
102,Tung HT,4,A fair airlines to choose for the departures from Vietnam to ASEAN countries or domestic destinations when you are in Vietnam. <br><br>This is a member of Skyteams alliance.
103,ExVotoFatum,4,"The flight in the fully booked plane was very pleasant. Good legroom, full meal at a 90 Minutes flight, excellent and friendly staff.<br>I can only recommend .<br>Cons: Even I was 2 hours before at Terminal in Bangkok there were huge crowds for checking in to Hanoi and Saigon. One hour waiting time."
103,ExVotoFatum,4,First time with Vietnam airlines and very satisfied. Check in friendly and helpful.<br>They serve full meal with wine on this short flight.<br>Leg room enough. Unfortuntaly older plane with no screens . <br>Overall a good experience I can recommend<br>.
103,Har K,5,"We were on our 1st time taking Vietnam airlines to Hanoi.  Overall experience satisfactort especially when ticket price was economical. - cheaper than budget airlines.<br><br>We were given full peace when we were on the plane, not many announcement or air stewardess were not moving around too frequently which actually did help to let us enjoy our ""rest"" in plane.   No inflight entertainment system but was ok since most of us had our own devices to entertain ourselves. The whole journey was smooth and did not encountered much turbulence hence felt stable abd safe.<br><br>The food was really good.  Tasted delicious n portion was also good.  They served either beef or fish on both our flights (returned). <br><br>Will take Vietnam Airlines again if we are given a choice next time."
103,Hanh Van Pham,5,"Only one word to describe the service of Vietnam Airlines: AWESOME. Even on a 2-hour domestic flight, you can experience a jumbo airplane, where you can turn your seat into a flat bed. My great time on the sky started with a tasty dinner, slept on a flat bed, and ended with some snack/refreshments before landing."
103,docletran,4,Vietnam Airlines business class passengers flying out of BKK have been denied the right to access the Sky Lounge Team instead has been directed to a small smelly local lounge that even do not have a toilet facilities and the food offered was terrible . So Vietnam Airlines upgrade your lounge or do not advertised yourself as 4 star airlines . It is a lie
104,Ibrey A,3,Crew are friendly and professional. Cleanliness and general cabin appearance looks good. <br><br>Boarding was terrible as boarding started from the staircase at the both ends with not in particular order. Passengers got stuck in the isle as some has to move to front who happened to board from the back and some has to move back who boarded from the front. They could have boarded either from the back or from the front to avoid congestion in the isle.
104,SandyCraigN,1,"We travelled from Laos (Vientiane) to Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City).  We then continued on to Kaohsiung, also on Vietnam Airlines.  On the way to Ho Chi Minh City, the plane made a 50 minute stop in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to let passengers on and off the plane.  We were not allowed to get off of the plane.  However, our baggage did get off the plane.  When we arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, there were no bags.  The ground arrangements were being handled by China Airlines.  We talked to the employee in charge of baggage who was conveniently located right next to the baggage carousel.  The China Airlines employee, who handled our claim, told us that this happens all of the time with Vietnam Airlines.  25 Hours later, after being in constant contact with the China Airlines employee, we picked up our baggage at the airport.  China Airlines was great.  Vietnam Airlines should be put out of business.  In addition, Vietnam Airlines refused to provide any compensation."
104,barry e,5,"the aircraft was clean and departed on time the service was good and the food was excellent ,some of the best airline food i have ever tasted, it was also a nice touch to have an complimentry pack with toothpaste tooth brush and slippers inside, all in all a great trip"
104,srimanone,4,I join their lotus club and took a flight from Phu quoc to Saigon. Check In was a little spotty and could use some better instructions. Plane was late and no notice on gate . Until Much later. Flight was good had row to Myself. Seats were tight but expected<br>Will recommend and fly again
104,happyopenmindedtraveler❤,4,"It was a relatively short flight, with a flight time of about 1 hour and 20 minutes, from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. The whole inflight crew seemed to work very efficiently together, as a team, while serving the refreshments and snacks. A friendly and professional airline as far as i am concerned, at least from what i have experienced and have seen for myself, for the first time with this airline, just this morning."
105,Thomas F,4,The plane arrived a bit late and the boarding began behind schedule but it loaded very quickly and left on time. No Problems and a full meal was served.
105,Thanh Huynh,4,Great airlines and on time for all our flight. Good communication as there was a flight that delay which they email us in advanced so we know what's happening. Highly recommended
105,Zara S,2,"First time on Vietnam Airlines, Kuala Lumpur - Saigon - Seoul. All cabin crews were cold and not helpful. Food so-so. Bad experience i will never fly with them anymore. Enough said."
105,Jan de Teliga,5,"The seats were fantastic, comfortable with a feeling of spaciousness.<br>The service was outstanding and the meals were excellent.<br>It was our first trip with Vietnam Airlines and we will definitely by flying with them again."
105,DRW44,5,"This was our first venture into Business Class and we weren't disappointed on the Airbus 350-900 Business Class &amp; priority boarding. Very welcoming and helpful staff.  Couchette-style reclining, slippers, pillow, blanket, a toilet bag containing everything one could want on this eleven-hour flight, personal headphones and TV. Excellent menu choices for breakfast and lunch.  Well worth the extra money.<br>TIP: The headphone socket is a dedicated triple socket for the airline's headphones but I could use my own by pushing the standard stereo plug only halfway in one of the holes."
106,Le Quynh,4,Diverse flight to Europe and Asian countries. Quite good services. Price is reasonable.        <br>I prefer to travel by Vietnam Airline always.
106,Jamal,1,"Direct flight from London to Hanoi,11 hours, fairly simple you'd think?!<br><br>They did not hand out the in flight headphone until 2 hours of being on the plane (about 45mins to an hour of being in the air). We were served our first meal around 2 and half hours into the flight, which was good timing... However, there was no meal served until and hour before landing... So you're talking a 7/8 hour gap on the flight with no meal.<br>To make matters worse, they serve three options for lunch, 20 of us had no choice for the first meal, as two of the dishes had finished. They said everyone chose the Thai green or beef noodle, so we were all stuck with fish (no veggie option). <br><br>The first meal was deemed as lunch and second breakfast.... Where's dinner? - OK, I thought to myself it's OK, I'll just order something in between and pay for it as I was reallyy hungry, (this is 5 hours after my first meal) I was told they have no instant noodles left nor sandwiches, just wasabi peanuts to buy... .<br><br>They tried to treat this as night flight, although we left London at 11am. A lot of people on my flight were complaining about the lack of food served and lack of food to buy to make up for the airlines shortfall. <br><br>To make matters worse, I landed in Hanoi, hungry at 5am/6am with no suitcase... This somehow was left in London. I spent 3 days in Hanoi with no suitcase (containing my clothes, medication for my skin, my partners birthday present etc). <br><br>So I decided to write a letter of complaint, which was dismissed, they said that if I would like to seek further compensation than the 30USD I received at the airport, I should send receipts of my purchases and they might be able to reimburse.... I find this very clever on their behalf, which market stall in Hanoi, a place of barter and cash exchange provides receipts? <br><br>So I've lost that battle with the airline before it started. Altogether, a terrible flight, followed by an unfortunate situation with my case, completed with terrible customer service from the team dealing with the whole situation.<br><br>Fly at your own risk, I know price is the main dictator often with flights, but if there's a close second on price, consider it."
106,287mandyt,5,"Nice friendly staff, good food and plenty of in flight entertainment to choose from. Seats comfy, managed to sleep most of the night on our return trip."
106,Tyh1788,5,"We booked the ticket from Vietnam airline to fly from Malaysia to Osaka when it was on sale, as such the prices were even more affordable then the budget airlines.<br><br>It was my first time flying the airline and it will definitely not be my last. The seats were clean and has a wide leg space, entertainment choices aplenty, the stewardess were polite and pleasant and the food was just amazing. Truth be told it was definitely a way better experience flying with vietnam airlines rather then with the other big name airlines."
106,Rico,5,"We flew from Danang to Dalat with Vietnam airlines. Vietnam airlines is not really a budget airline and tends to run on the expensive side. But, they were the only ones with the flights that we wanted from Danang to Dalat. Everything else is pretty average and standard like most airlines. However it was a very uncomfortable flight for me because I am a big &amp; tall person and the seats were not comfortable nor did they allow enough legroom, which happens to me a lot. However, the flight was less than 50% full and most of the exit row seats were available but the stewardess would not let me sit there. Anyway it is ashamed that they have that policy. Some airlines once you take off don’t mind if you change seats."
107,helenjl2019,5,We upgraded to premium economy which was great  - more space and comfort. Food good and service good. <br>Very relaxing flight and time passed reasonably well.
107,normieUk,1,Awful food. Long gap before service<br>Nothing in the galley to eat<br>Screens not working on long haul<br><br>Pity they don’t showcase their amazing country’s food
107,aleksandarkrc,4,"It was the third time that we travelled with this company, it was good but we had a better service last time.Few films in french and not lot's of food.Last tims we had noodles at will."
107,Peter PhotoVide... D,5,The friendly staff at Vietnam airlines added to the unique experience this country offers to travellers. Comfortable seating and smiling faces exude confidence whilst inside the aircraft because the take off and landing are always a bit nerve wracking. Love the look and love the people.
107,traveller423,5,"We went from Saigon, Vietnam to Siem Reap, Cambodia.  Everyone with the airline was very accommodating.  It was only an hour and a half flight so there wasn't much that could go wrong."
108,Tim M,4,No complaints.  Good meals and standard seats.  There was a decent selection of movies and games to help pass the time on a long flight.
108,greg dennis,5,"November 2019 I booked 6 x flights through SE Asia with Vietnam Airlines. Now, I'll never fly with anyone else.....Beautiful aircraft, supreme service, meals on every flight, no matter how short, prompt and efficient check in services, no delays or issues.....absolutely perfect ! And an upgrade on the final overnight leg from Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne was no drama at all. So, check them out. Hopefully you'll be as impressed as I am."
108,alamak1984,1,"Reservation code HXRYPG<br><br>Upon check in, I only found that my economy ticket will not entitle free one piece of baggage allowance(23kg). Eventually, I was being forced to purchase the checked baggage which almost equals to the price of my air ticket.<br><br>I was so anger because during the online booking, Vietnam Airline did not use readable font size that able to draw people attention or even totally did not inform the client the free baggage allowance is not inclusive. I swear that I won't click the button to make the damn booking if you have clearly informed me that free baggage allowance is not inclusive. Your poor online booking system caused us not able to make an informed decision.<br><br>According to your official website, there is only 3 class of service<br>1)business - 32kg checked baggage + 18kg hand baggage<br>2)premium economy - 23kg checked baggage + 18kg hand baggage<br>3)economy - 23kg checked baggage + 12kg hand baggage<br><br>However, I was so surprised and happened to know upon checking in the airport that I belonged to so called ""economy super lite"" class which couldn't entitle free baggage allowance.<br><br>Your official website is very misleading because certain pages introducing about the baggages never mentioned economy super lite class but certain pages did. <br><br>I suspected that Vietnam Airline is purposely concealing this matter, causing many passengers purchased the checked baggage upon check in, so that Vietnam Airline could make huge illegal profit from this.<br><br>Take other budget airline as example, they would definitely tell us that the checked baggage is not inclusive and ask whether we need to add price to buy it during the process of online booking. Why traditional airline - Vietnam Airline didn't? What's their motive behind?<br><br>The service on board also very dissapointing. the meal was cold and i gave up asking the flight attendant to give me the coffee because she did not turn up eventually after promised to me twice<br><br>Very Very Very bad experience!"
108,EV512,1,"This was my first time flying on Vietnam airlines. It was just a short travel time from da nang to ho chi mingh but it delayed for 40 minutes! The worst part was that they gave me a seat without Window! We even did not expect such seats in the airplane! It’s service level was much below expectation! It did not worth the price you pay for it. I regretted that I did not choose the low- cost airlines! At least, it cost me less . So, next time when you choose domestic flight , never choose this airlines. The worst I have ever encountered in my life. Totally unacceptable service level! If I can give zero mark, I will certainly do so in this review!"
108,Amazingland,4,"First time taking VN airlines due to good saving for the family trip. The outbound flight was 6 hours transit at Hanoi and inbound flight was 2 hours transit at HCM... Both were smooth and easy. The food was good with western or japanese style to choose. The only down side is the inflight entertainment with very limited choice of movies and from Sin to VN, there is no inflight entertainment. <br>With the price we paid, nothing much we could complaint."
109,Fiona N,5,"Amazing service starting from bag check in at Tullamarine airport to getting off the aeroplane after my return. Everything about my experience from all of the staff involved on and off the aeroplanes,  the food, drinks, comfort on the aeroplane and in the airport lounges before my flights were faultless. Highly recommend Vietnam airline."
109,birminghamcorbiere,4,"First time using this airline. Chose it since it flies direct and non stop to Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam so only about 12.5 hrs journey.Flew Business Class in order to try to sleep for some of the trip. Staff and service super polite and attentive, excellent food with choices and top quality wine and other beverages. Good range of entertainment with own good size screen. Toilet facilities were always clean and smelt pleasant, not always the case on airplanes. The only thing which might improve the experience would be an under duvet or something to cushion the seat when made into a flat bed. It was really hard! But great value for money and I would certainly fly with this airline again."
109,Mark S,4,"We flew premium ecconomy with Vietnam Airlines in November 2019.    The flight was 11 hours out and 13 return so opted to pay a little extra for premium ecconomy. Everyhting was great - flight on time, food excellent, services onboard were very good and plentyful. <br><br>We did decide to try for an upgade on the return flight.  Using a link on the vietnam airlines website, I ended up on a website run by a company called 'Optiontown' which I thourght was part of the airlines. Paid £650 to go on standby for an upgrade.  Up to the point of checkin, we had not heard from 'Optiontown' and the vietnam airlines staff at the airport did a lot of shoulder shrugging.  We did not get upgraded! But we did eventually get our money refunded some time later.  <br><br>Bearing in mind, the link on the offiicial Vietnam airlines took us to Optiontown - be advised this is actually nothing to do with the airline.  Be careful when considering an upgarde."
109,Pauline G,5,"I flew to Vietnam with Vietnam Airlines on the 27th November for 16 days. I am on a tour of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia with a group organised by Mercury Travel. There have been 4 internal and external flights with this airline company and I am due to return to the UK again with this company. Being tall,I have been very happy with the leg room, comfort of the aircraft and quality of service. There hasn't been a delay with any flight. Cabin crew are very polite and friendly. I highly recommend this airline company."
109,kaz L,4,"Because of promotion, Price was much attractive than the airfare of the budget airlines without checking luggage. Meals were not bad."
110,Graham A,3,"Travelling on premion economy on Vietnam Airlines continues to improve.  The aircraft (Boeing 787 dreamliner) is still relatively new and was clean and the seats extremely comfortable.  Service however still lags a little way behind the top airlines although the crew were friendly and smart in their Ao Dais.  However the standard of meals served was a little disappointing and I was not impressed when the breakfast served before landing was cold, and mine was not the only one as several other passengers made the same observation.  I did mention this to the attendant and she did say that if I had mentioned it earlier she would have reheated it but as she was busy in another part of the cabin I dont think that there would have been time. Anyway could she have reheated and served everybody's meal in the remaining short time before landing?  Also I feel that the airline are a bit stingy in the provision of drinks. On most airlines when ordering a Gin and Tonic I have been given a miniature and can of tonic but on every flight with tis airline I had my drink poured for me with only a portion of the miniature and a splash of tonic offered; the oportunity to re-order was not given.  However non alcoholic drinks were always available when requested.<br>When booking my round trip to Da nang on line I was disappointed to be given only one option for my return flight from Da Nang to Ha Noi which resulted in  more than a six hour lay over even though later flights were available which would have been far more traveller friendly.  On booking I telephoned the airline to request a later departure from Da nang but was told this was not possible.  Why?"
110,TrvlwBrenda,2,"My first time to fly to Ho Chi Minh so i naturally gravitated to their flag carrier- Vietnam Airlines. Booked online and paid normal price for an econony seat. <br>Checking in at the airport, ground steward asked me to pay usd70 for checkin luggage. Surprise! I was told its not included in the fare and that info about this charge is disclosed in their website.<br>Ok, maybe i didnt read their website, my bad but horror of horrors, this is not a budget airline and i wasnt expecting to be charged for my luggage.<br>My sister, who I'm meeting in Ho Chi Minh flew from Manila via Philippine Airlines without paying for luggage fee and even bought her ticket on promo.<br>Anyway, i learned my lesson. I know better next time."
110,Venture23573401085,3,"Vietnam  airlines  is a  average  carrier  the  service  let it down ,the cabin crew had difficulty understanding  english and the  service  hit and  miss. the  seats in the  middles of business clas had no over head air vents and the  cabin temp was  26c.I asked if they could turn  down the  cabin temp but would only go 1c down to 25c  still to hot,ideally cabin temp should be 21-22c.The  business class lounges  are  poor in ho chi min and in hanoi with limited selection of  food.If you value a true and rewarding business class flight  try another  premium airline like  Qantas ,emirates ,singapore  airlines ."
110,Hung Nguyen,4,"We chose Vietnam airlines as it flies direct from London to Ho Chi Minh city. We travelled on business class as it was a long 13 hour journey and we needed to sleep on a flat bed. Service in general was very good from checking in to boarding. The only disappointing thing was the food which was quite average for business class. Their Phõ noodle soup was no way near the delicious Vietnamese Phõ that we used to enjoy in Vietnam.<br>The other surprise was the amendment fees: we had to change our return date due to unexpected circumstances and we had to pay another £1600 for 2 persons! <br>Please note that on arrival in Vietnam there will be a bus shuttle transfer from the aircraft to airport.<br>All in all, it was a good experience with Vietnam airlines: new aircraft with a warm welcome."
110,Hidayat T,4,"The flight is quite pleasant, but my trip from HCM - Hanoi was best, because we were on a wide bodied plane. All the other Flights from Jakarta - HCM, then Hanoi - HCM - Jakarta was on an older plane.<br>Food was okay, overall service was okay. <br>The crew flew back to HCM after the HCM - Jakarta flight. It was just a short flight.<br>We started our journey home, from Halong Bay, at 01:00 in the morning to catch our 6:00 flight from Hanoi to HCM. <br>Book flights with Vietnam Air on Business, is not always include the lounge service. <br>Luckily our tickets include such services ...."
111,EuroMark,1,"Staff on all Vietnam Airlines feel they are above their guests in the air as wel as groundstaff. They are hardly understandable, and very unfriendly. It starts from the moment you check in."
111,Jill S,5,"Vietnam Airline staff are great. Their staff on the counters go out of their way to help.<br>We had a issue that our connecting flights had been rescheduled, Vietnam Airlines had emailed our tour company who did not act on this info. When we arrived at the airport and tried to check in, the staff explained the situation. They were so helpful, we couldn’t fault them.  10 out of 10 Vietnam Airline Staff!"
111,robinvn,5,"My wife and I decided on Premium Economy, to make the flight experience even better, Nice touch that you can check in with business class and save queuing. You are allowed 2 pieces of luggage each up to 23kg. Check in was a breeze and flight on time. <br>we have used various airlines over the years to go to Vietnam and this is the very first time we've taken one flight to get there. So that was a bonus. 12 1/2 hours seems daunting but I didn't feel like it was long, after watching a few movies on board. <br>The food was really very nice and nice to have proper cutlery on not plastic knives and forks. Service from the cabin was very good, efficient and polite. Vietnam Airlines are doing very well and I think will continue to improve. Very impressed with them and the flight was super smooth with no turbulence at all. Would certainly use them again."
111,685chin,4,It was a direct flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city (8h15m) and I enjoyed the in variety in-flight entertainment. The food and service are good consider the airlines is not  that reputable.
111,Robyn M,4,"Two flights in 2 weeks. One great, the other ordinary.<br>We love this airline with the latest flat beds for business class and normally great food and certainly the flight up was fantastic. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the flight back to Melbourne last Friday night. The staff were less than accommodating, which was disappointing. I guess that we all have bad days.We will enjoy our next flight, I am sure"
112,KareenSSS,5,"Very nice and comfortable flight on Dreamliner <br>Service excellent<br>Food also very nice - bar one dish ;)<br>Good entertainment offer<br>Very comfi bed - configurations are great, all well thought out.<br>Lavatories could have been kept a little more clean :("
112,700tom,5,"For a long haul flight at mid night paying a little extra gets you a lot. There is priority boarding to very comfortable seats, arranged 2,3,2. There is ample recline and leg support for a great sleep. The premium economy section is separate with its own attendants and 2 toilets. Good food options with real cuttlery are available and snack option available in the galley. The 12 hour flight was smooth and early at  Heathrow. We arrived adequately rested for our onward journey"
112,ashrafel,5,"It was fantastic, the crew are fantastic, the meals are good and the IFE worked well. The toilets were clean all through the flight, the crew did not rest, all up serving food and drinks and collecting rubbish for the whole 8+ hours. Enjoyed the flight specially I had the ESO (Empty seat option) I had 3 seats for my self, 3 seats for my wife and 3 seats for my 3 year old. the A/C was full other than that. Thank you Vietnam Airline"
112,Paulo Eduardo,4,"A pleasant flight with Vietnam airlines, no delays, good attention from the flight attendants, comfortable seat even being in economy class. The meal was good, although not fantastic. Points to improve: more recent films and films with English subtitles/translations."
112,larkenRidgefield_CT,4,The airport sign in was efficient . Boarding was good on the tarmac. Flight was short ...I gave it a 4 because one guy hassled people to not put small luggage in the overhead bins but the bins were mostly empty!
113,Michael M,5,"My Flight Centre agent was able to get me a seat in premium economy with a carry-on bag, blanket, slippers and pillow available.  I paid US$180 for the return flight as there was so much leg room The meals were excellent but too much for me, and silver service."
113,Emily,5,"I would recommend Vietnam Airlines based on our experience. Our flight was on time, the plane was very clean &amp; comfortable."
113,James P,5,Flew to Vietnam in June and decided to up grade to Premium Economy I highly recommend the up grade it cost a few dollars more but well worth it. The flight attendants are always asking you if you require any thing.The leg room and space between seats meant you could stretch you legs out and relax.On my next visit to Vietnam I will be flying Premium Economy Class
113,Sue M,5,The plane was comfortable with seats feeling maybe slightly bigger than usual.<br>Food was acceptable and service friendly.
113,Viv B,3,"Flying Business Class to Cambodia then Vietnam return was a more comfortable experience.  Some of aircraft 'looked tired' within and even though there was more seating space it was not as cushioned as some newer aircraft.  <br><br>Food on board departing from Melbourne was more enjoyable; scallop, green curry, barramundi, green vegetables and rice followed by ice-cream with a hint of spice.... than the meals on return flight to Melbourne, seafood salad, lemongrass skewered beef and disappointing Pho, somehow not quite as tasty overall.  Though the flight back was not full in Business Class, customer service was polite though not 'warm, friendly/attentive' as in some other airlines ..... where there's offer to 'make up bed' and ongoing checking/asking if more water or anything is required.<br><br>Business airport lounges varied, some were quite basic and others were little oases of comfort with good choices of drinks fruits and food.  <br><br>On some flights there was a folded face washer left on the floor in the corner - wondered why ..... not a hygienic presentation......<br><br>Ground staff were helpful both at domestic and international counters.  <br><br>Travelling can be stressful, so quality flying rather than quantity flying justifies flying Business Class, worth saving up for."
114,TomStar1,4,"For someone who selects Singapore Airlines as my go too option for flying in Asia, I was quietly surprised with Vietnam Airlines service and professionalism. I flew the 787 from Sydney to Saigon. The A350 from Hanoi back to Saigon and what a great experience with both routes. They fly new models and you can see the investment to go above and beyond for their clients. Staff are fantastic and courteous. Will I fly them again.....you bet!!"
114,ozzie-rick,4,"Vietnam Airlines fly directly from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh airport. 8.5hrs.  I wouldn't bother with cheaper airlines with stop overs etc as their rates are quite reasonable.  The service is professional and the assistance with any interconnecting flight is very good which takes the angst out of the travel. I have flown with them on numerous occasions and in different levels of comfort - Premium economy etc. They are my first choice to Vietnam.  Being 6'2"" tall they usually offer me the exit row as well."
114,Lymey88,5,Comfortable plane and only one third full so we slept where we wanted. Staff lovely and food delicious
114,LJY,5,"Again travelled to Spain via Paris with Vietnam.<br>No complaints, food lovely, service and staff attentive, entertainment plentiful also.<br>Great service in Ho Chi Min for stopover coming home."
114,AbbottHsu,4,"It is ok to take Vietnam airline from Jakarta to HCMC all the time. The flight time is around 3 hours plus, not too long for business trip. Food and service is ok but the only thing is there is no personel TV for passengers. One more thing, the plans is A321, not a big plans. Space is a little bit crowded. Enjoy it."
115,accworld,5,"Yes they provided nice vegan food, its normal plane as any other but it did take off and landed on time. entertainment is good"
115,Geoff,5,I have been using Vietnam Airlines for the last 5 years and at the beginning the service and understanding was quite poor. Complaints were ignored with a smile. ☹️<br>But as we have gone through the tears it has improved beyond expectations. We fly between 2 to 3 times a year.. A yes I can totally recommend the direct flights from London. England to ho chi minh Vietnam.<br>Leg space is good.. Food not bad. Very helpful cabin crew. Also they are now prepared to listen to are moans.<br>The lotus airmiles card is very good you start at silver with benifits and you can progress up to platinum. With huge benefits ie extra baggage allowance. Vip lounge. And many more benfits<br><br>So all in all good modern airplanes.<br>Good in flight service.<br>Good entertainment.<br>Polite and help staff in flight and also at check in.<br>So yes tottaly recommend.<br><br>👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
115,CheeY0ng,4,Booked a multi destinations trip on Vietnam Airlines from Singapore to Osaka and back from Tokyo. Per head include tax S$500. 30kg lugguage. Meals were provides and in-flight entertainment was up to date. I few on their new A350 and B787.
115,pattyalford,5,"A wonderful flight.  Although it was windy and raining when we took off, the flight was smooth.  The service was efficient and I couldn't have asked for better.  Check-in especially was a treat.  Because I am 72, I was put in the priority queue which had me thinking, ""Getting old has its benefits.""  Thank you Vietnam Airlines."
115,A5942CVmichaeld,4,"I recently flew internationally with Vietnam Airlines and was impressed with the quality and service during the two-way journey. I had previously flown domestically with VA in Vietnam and it was about what you'd expect, but this latest journey was equal to the best global carriers. Mind you, the baggage handlers leave a fair bit to be desired and damage to luggage is common."
116,Brian J.,5,"This was a surprise as I had never used Vietnam Airlines before this trip.<br>They were on time to leave,the food was good,the service was excellent,the entertainment system was very good and we arrived on time and refreshed.<br>Compared to our last overseas flight which was 5 hours late in an older plane with an inadequate entertainment system and the food was terrible.<br>Full marks to Vietnam airlines and I'll never travel Qantas again"
116,waynestafford,5,"I have flown various airlines from Melb to Ho Chi Minh and return, nothing compares to the direct flights offered by Vietnam Airlines. Stopovers are a distraction to getting to your destination, who wants to take 28 hours to get to HoChi Minh when you can fly direst for just over 98 hours."
116,Sue J,5,"We travelled Vietnam airlines recently and they were terrific. Couldn't fault them at all. <br>Left on time, even 15 minutes early on one flight. <br>Plenty of leg room in economy compared to Qantas. <br>Food is lovely and staff very accommodating. <br>We had 3 internal flights as well with Vietnam airlines and will definitely be recommending them as well as using them again."
116,Paula S,5,"Long flight but there is enough entertainment to watch. The food was good on the flight out, not so good on the inbound one. Wouldf recommend though."
116,arthurjudy,4,have flown with this airline a number  times     no complaints  attentive staff very helpful <br><br>with any request
117,Steven H,5,"Great friendly service. My kids were happy, which made it a good flight. Fast service! The flight was on time."
117,Anne N,4,"Premium economy seats very reasonable.  Food better on outward journey than home bound one, but not bad quality. No real complaints, films could be better!!!!<br>Also used them for internal flights, very good service again."
117,marktheguru,5,"Vietnam Airlines offers a very comfortable business class. The 787 Dreamliner has 1-2-1 herringbone layout in business class that offers relative privacy and comfort. The lie-flat seats offer plenty of legroom (i'm 185cm) even for tall passengers. The cabin service is attentive and the food great. Stopovers in Vietnam can be long but the airline offers transit tours at no cost where you are greeted at the airport and escorted to a hotel to freshen up, have a meal, and a short tour if time permits.<br>Overall , it is a very relaxing way to get to Europe."
117,tbr2020,3,Premium Economy : we couldn’t get the places we wanted to the food was poor although they are advertising with access to the launch we weren’t allowed to use the launch at Hanoi international airport boarding was good
117,JaneMath,5,Very comfortable flatbeds. Good service and food. Very affordable price for business class to Europe. Would definitely recommend. The only negative is the lounge in Hanoi...very crowded and it was hard to find a seat.
118,Brenda S,5,"Previously we have travelled Thai or Emirates but they do not fly direct. We were sceptical about flying Vietnam Airlines but it proved to be fanastic. The Business Class service far surpassed Emirates Business Class and although Thai First is lovely the time we saved flying direct was brilliant. I can do without being in Dubai airport in the middle of the night and although the Bangkok lounges are good it's better to get there in one go. We could not fault the space, the service or the food. We shall always fly Vietnam airlines again and wish we had done previously."
118,Brian A,5,"Flights are always on time, flight crew cannot be faulted, food is great and of course the Dreamliner (787) to fly in"
118,Danielle B,5,Vietnam Airlines was amazing.   There’s not one thing I could fault them with.<br>Spacious<br>Great Service<br>Didn’t go hungry (it was like 2 x 3 course meals)<br>Value For Money<br><br>Would definitely recommend.
118,Trek598076,5,Great flight on Dreamliner very smooth. Hostesses very caring &amp; helpfull comfortable seating/ good legroom.
118,Andrew Y,3,Got to Bangkok after a 12hr flight from london collected our cases to check in to our flight with Vietnam airlines only to be told we have luggage included on the way back but not included going to Hanoi.<br>Not sure how this is possible I said we are always going to have luggage both ways anyway they made me go and change £100 and pay only cash for excess luggage.<br>Very strange but had no choice.<br>Won’t make this mistake again.<br>Please if anyone books direct with Vietnam Airlines check and double check your luggage is included both ways as you will be stung.
119,Julian E,4,"Really nice flight, pleasant check in but came a cropper on my return. They said my MacBook was good to fly to Da Nang but it was confiscated on the return as then it was deemed dangerous. I had to sort out my own courier to get it back to Hanoi taking 3 days. I knew there was a recall going on but I did specifically ask. Anyway it’s still a nice airline and I will use again."
119,Georgian Mist,3,"Felt very much compressed in economy on the 787 ! I was very much looking forward to fly on a 787 and besides the direct flight for such a long haul, I wasn’t impressed the slightest ! Like I said very squeezed, average menu and snacks, average inflight entertainment ! Won’t be flying again on a 787 !"
119,Steviet,4,12 hour plus flights in economy are usually quite an ordeal however the 787 VietnamAirlines flight was well served with decent economy class food and drink and reasonable entertainment choices. Leg room is as good as any other airline economy I have used.
119,deukhalion,4,"I'd booked a tour and the flights with VietNam airlines came as part of the deal. I knew no-one who had ever flown with them and was a touch apprehensive regarding in flight service, food etc<br><br>I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised on a number of fronts. Seat was very comfortable, in flight entertainment was far superior to a supposedly top middle eastern airline I flew with last year - the one who sponsor Arsenal. Service was better as well.  Food was OK but is airline food in economy ever actually good??<br><br>I had 2 short internal flights within Viet Nam and perfectly acceptable<br><br>The return flight from Ho Chi Minh city was very similar in all respects<br><br>If I were flying to the far east again I would certainly include them in my search as I bet they are a lot cheaper than the supposed best, and actually better on some scores."
119,LMLisbon,4,"I flew Vietnam Airlines in Premium Economy from London to Saigon, and was very happy with the airline. It was my first time in Vietnam Airlines, and it was a very long flight. But the Premium Economy was well worth the extra. I am not talking about the food, which was of course better, but on a long flight, the extra space was really important. Service was good and I managed to have a good night sleep. The extra legroom really made a big difference. So upgrade yourself if you can on a long flight. I believe we paid about 500 pounds more, but was well worth it. It is not as luxurious as air France on the same class, but I think the seat inclination was better."
120,Teresa H,3,"I had flow the airline to Vietnam and it was fine. On the way back it was just horrible. My seat was right in front of the bathroom. I have never heard a toilet that flushed as loud as this. I had been told before the flight that there were business class seat available, I didn't want anyone to give me a seat I wanted to pay for the seat. When I asked at the ticket counter they simply blew me off with no real response."
120,Stephen G,5,"A twelve hour flight in economy class, but it was a pleasant and comfortable experience. A good range of entertainment on offer and I found the food and service excellent."
120,QuocRoland,5,This time is my 6th time fly to Japan with Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>Service was nice and good smile. Food was ok. They update new movies in their entertainment system. Everything is worthy.<br><br>I will fly Vietnam Airlines again.
120,Paul M,5,"Having travelled with a number of the world's leading airlines Vietnam was a new experience but a very good one. Couldn't fault them in any way, their staff are excellent and for this flight we had a very modern plane."
120,Michael,4,"We used Vietnam Airlines three times in a month for our travels. I have listed the most recent flight for our review but we also flew Hong Kong to Hanoi, and Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh.<br>All in all, Vietnam Airlines was good. No flights cancelled or re scheduled dramatically (just the flight from Hanoi to HCMC which was delayed 30 minutes while already waiting). There was standard amount of leg room and space for carry-on items. Decent in-flight entertainment on some services, but no TV on others. I thought they had wifi on board now as it appears to be advertised everywhere, alas none of the journeys seemed to provide this. There was a meal/snacks on all 3 flights which was an unexpected treat; wasn't the best food but was still edible. Staff are friendly and check in was efficient always. We did have a problem booking the first flight as I left the 'advanced passenger information' to enter at a later date during booking (as I was in a rush), only to find you can't really edit a booking once payment is completed?! Although I'm sure it would've been fine at the airport, or they would've allowed it during online check in, I still got in contact via email and they added the API for me, before online check in was open, which was helpful. Another problem was that they seem to take two lots of your payment on occasion, for a couple of days as some sort of hold, this is refunded but it does make you panic at first glance, seeing a double charge, and it may be an issue if you're paying by debit card for instance and you have an agreed overdraft limit...<br>Overall I would use this airline again if I had to, the main reason we used it this time was company reputibility coupled with their free 1 X hold luggage per person policy which meant no extra/hidden costs on top of the seat price."
121,K Niaz Morshed,5,i was choose vietnam airlines for its review and it's really comes out. one of the great airlines for its service and in flight entertainment. love the system and service of both ground staff and cabin crew. love to fly with them again and again.
121,DWirt,3,"As one would expect the VN flight attendants were great. Reason for average was the entire experience. When I first attempted to book the flights, this was a round trip to Paris, VN website had an issue and crashed. This locked up the fare and the seats I had select which forced me to have to call their customer service. After a while that was finally sorted and I had to go back online and redo the entire process over again.<br><br>Now the big disappoint on this flight segment was the fact it was sold as being an A350-900 aircraft. Shortly after the booking I received an email with an aircraft subsitiution of a A3210-200. As you can imagine the difference from expectations to reality was quite large (no AVOD, flatbed seat, etc.). So the entire flight while pleasant due to the wonderful flight crew I could not help feel irritated that what was sold was not what was delivered."
121,Roland K,5,Very friendly staff and good prices. Very good connections to  the Vietnam Airline staff at the airport and on bord.<br> Online check-in very easy and fast. Recommendation: member of Lotus Vietnam Airline. Very good meals and drinks.
121,Roland K,5,"Best service during online check-in, desk check-in, long night flight and check-out. Very good and tasty meals and drinks. Good prices and very friendly bord-staff. News papers from the starting von country."
121,mgoldman666,4,"Efficient no fuss or tooth sucking checkin. Our flight was not entirely full so some room to stretch out. Overnight flight with dinner served about 0200 local and breakfast 0400 local (7 hour time difference). Staff polite and attentive and not intrusive. Armrest screen control too easy to nudge accidentally. Good choice of in flight entertainment. Food was good. Not a lot of alcohol, but a snack/drink bar set up in stern later and you could go for soft drinks and snacks.  On time. I would definitely consider using them again if I went to Vietnam. Did not like HCMC airport."
122,atontao,4,i flew siem reap / hanoi + hanoi / bangkok suvarnabhumi<br><br>check in was fast and efficient<br><br>boarding was average<br><br>seats were reasonably comfortable and space for legs accepptable<br><br>meals on board acceptable<br><br>staff ok<br><br>both flights arrived on time<br><br>luggage was deliverd promptly<br><br>good airline to summarize
122,NotoriousKITbaybebee,1,"Level of service and value dropped in span of 1 year.  Online checking not available on site.  Booked directly online for same time frame and destination, at around same cost but this year, no check-in bag is included, additional $60.  Will look at other options for future travels in region."
122,Syaling Ong,4,With an economy price you get a really good service. The flight meal really good. The time is punctual.
122,Mohan K,4,The check-in counter had a long queue. However; once you reach the counter things move fast. No-fuss about the size of your bags and a couple of extra kilos luggage than allowed. It was a short flight and the seat was much better than Malindo airlines.
122,fitzbip,3,"International airline staff and flight attendants in particular should be fluent in the english language? Should they not? Your answer agrees with mine. Well on board staff can hardly be understood on announcements let alone communicating with you. Quality of food served would be a 2 of 5 star rating, so is the beer and black tea. Was not game to try their coffee.<br>A tip flying internationally using Saigon (HoChiMinCity) as a hub: Well don't, one has to re-check in their luggage. If one connects up to a domestic flight, be prepared for at least 4 hours, as Visa requirements, Passport Control  and security checks will keep you waiting for 3 hours plus. Endless ques gives one anxiety for days to last. What tops the absolute dislike is that one has to remove their shoes going through security, hopefully everyone has washed their feet beforehand........<br>Then one has to walk for quite some distance to get to the Domestic Terminal, again to add confusion to one's distress. Signs of arrivals and departures appear reversed and lead one to keep chasing one's 'tail'. The actual Visa dispensation will not only set you back by a total of 37 U$ but also a minimum of a good hour. No one speaks any english anywhere and your google translation app is running hot into the red zone. Allow yourself p l e n t y of time in order to avoid stress levels to peak and spoil your holidays."
123,T P,1,"Due to Phuc Quoc airport closed on my travelling dated, so I can not be able to make it to my Japan trip.  Vietnam Airline WILL NOT be able to replacement,  complementary ticket for my next trip, and even any refunded ticket.  But prior to the day of my travel I received an email from Vietnam Airline stated that my connection flight will be on time and even 15 earlier than my schedule time.  It's DID NOT mentioned any closing down the airport,  either the flight will be delay  or cancelled on my travelling day.  Due to their lack of services I had ended no showed on my group tour trip.  Even the airport closed on that day, they still selling out airline ticket to other customer at the airport.   This is a very bad, careless, irresponsible action and very cold harden services."
123,rachna singh Laha,1,We forgot our wallet in the flight and we realised that after we left the airport <br><br>We cane back to the airport in about 15 minutes to inquire if they can check whether they got it .<br><br>It is unbelievable that they could not locate the wallet in their flight which had our ID cards in it<br><br>It’s a big shame !!
123,Rossablanca,4,"I was impressed with the boarding process, it was pretty quick and on time. The leg space was amazing (mind you, I am always on budget airlines). The in flight meal was a lot (again, I am always on budget airlines) , there were salad, main dish, bread and a banana. The service however was okay, maybe because of the language barrier, one of the stewardess did not understand our request for water. There's no entertainment but it is okay as the flight was short. They also provide wet tissue before we fly off. The landing however was scary as it feels like the airplane could fall apart anytime(it shakes and the vibration from it was really loud)"
123,Michael G,5,Had to fly  into  Hanoi  to  change   flight to  Vientiane   was  pleasantly  surprised  with  the  flight good  service   free  food   nice   aircraft an  Airbus  787  I  think   the  walk  in the  airport  was  very   long  tho  as  they   all seem  to be  now
123,JrnyJunkie,1,Horrible...will avoid them at all cost.  They served a meal set it down saying sorry...yeah they should be sorry; it was scrambled eggs with rice and smoked eel over the top...disgusting.  Since they put all of us Westerners in the back of the plane that was apparently all that they had left.  All of the Westerners were put in the very back of the plane; I am talking we had the very last seat next to the toilets...this happened on 4 different flights!  Coincidence?
124,MoscowLorna,2,"Really , they are terrible timekeepers .had to change flight day before trip due to updated schedule . Today 2 delays so far in Saigon. I had 4 hrs connection in Singapore to my next flight but now I'm wondering if I will make it. No announcements,  no reason . Just another hour late. I would never fly them by choice , though staff are nice,  they are too unreliable.  Even Vietjet is much better now."
124,A.M98,5,"It was only a 3 hour flight but we got dinner, dessert and some free drinks too. Deadly airline staff were sound too."
124,Prjes,5,I have travelled several times with Vietnam Airlines and their service has always been good. Last week I was travelling from Siem Reap to SGN where I was due to transit for a flight to Sydney. I suffered a medical incident on the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic and the ground staff were also excellent. In just over an hour to catch my connecting flight the ground staff wheel-chaired me through to the lounge where I managed to refresh before they wheel-chaired me onto the Sydney flight with minutes to spare. Well done VN.
124,thekneechiongs,5,"Pleasant service staff, no delays of the flights to/from Hanoi and Singapore, tasty food, clean toilets and more than just-enough leg room. Vietnam Airlines has won me over. My friend and I were pleased with our experience."
124,Kelvin,2,"Traveled on Vietnam Airlines for a recent trip to Hanoi in November. <br>The check-in ground and inflight service into Hanoi were generally acceptable efficiency and friendly attitude and happy faces. <br>However, the same pleasant flying experience was lacking during the flight out of Hanoi. <br>The flight attendants smiled to each other, but not to their passengers. <br>They went round their duties as quickly as possible with no time for customer service, which was strange as the flight time was easily 3 hours long, why the rush? <br>From past experience, my understanding of the meal service is to serve the window seat (seat A), then B and C, but the flight crew attended to us practiced a rampant service delivery. <br>I was served last at seat A, and the inconvenience of balancing the tray of food and drinks across and above the passengers at seat B &amp; C were very unnecessary and unprofessional. Luckily, both the passengers at seat B &amp; C were nice and patient of the interruptions. It was even stranger that this practice was inconsistent at other rows. <br>First time on Vietnam Airlines, not so good impression and expreience on the return trip, maybe will get better service on next flight."
125,Elizabeth Q,3,"This was a very short flight, under an hour, so only water given out for economy class. Seating was three by three. Beware - On their domestic flights Vietnam Airlines do tend to change the flight times, sometimes more than once and always to a later time, so if you have an important appointment its best to book an early flight."
125,G G,3,"Having seen postings on Trip Advisor of contributor's experience of airline &amp; my forthcoming use of it, for first time I was a bit concerned.<br>Naturally one person can have a good experience &amp; another person flying with the same airline on a different day can have a bad experience.<br>Arrived London Heathrow 3 hours pre flight to Vietnam. I didn't check in online so pot luck on seat. On a  11 hour flight I like to be able to get up and walk around so prefer aisle.<br>Only 4 people queueing in front of me for check in. I didn't use self check in terminals. Process  at desk quick &amp; efficient &amp; I got aisle seat.<br>Plane loading speedy, using zone allocation &amp; seat number system.<br>Take off on schedule &amp; plane clean.<br>Economy Class, but adequate leg room. If above 6 foot, Economy seating will be a bit uncomfortable. Given after plane take off, traveller's pouch, containing a pair of grey flight socks, slippers, toothbrush &amp; toothpaste. No eye mask, ear plugs. Plane was not full.<br>We were eventually issued with ear phones &amp; food menu.<br>Entertainment system basic &amp; with limited selection of films &amp; tv shows. Screen  adequate.<br><br>My seat mainly with older people, no crying children, which can make flight bad.<br><br>Booked a vegetarian meal, which was adequate but nothing special. <br>Saw in one contributor's post that after first meal staff made themselves scarce.<br>Attendants regularly came with trays of water &amp; fruit juice. Small sandwiches available during the night. Attendants responded to calls promptly."
125,Laural A,5,"This airline is fine and is just like flying domestic American or United. Leg room is the same and carry on luggage size is the same. Even though flight under 2 hours, received a meal and choice of beverage. All airline staff we encountered were helpful, courteous, and spoke English."
125,Laural A,5,"This airline is fine and the experience was just like flying on a short American or United flight. No issues with language-all spike English.  They board the back of the plane first (after row 26) but instead of waiting we just joined the back of that line and had no issues boarding even though we were in a row closer to the front. Carry on luggage size same as US. Flight attendants courteous and helpful. Say, Sin chow (hello) when boarding and Cam on (thank you) when leaving or when they’ve been helpful."
125,Richard A,3,"We took VN 256 flight from Ho Chi Minh city to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines flight (VN 256) on last 26 Nov 2019. <br>The aircraft is considered new, a wide body 787. Seat is pretty good, and has good distance.  It is also clean and comfortable. <br>The food and beverage services are very basic for a full service airline, something that should be improved.  No access to the lounge is provided even I though I am an Elite Plus Sky Team member, so not so much benefit here. <br>This is not my original flight actually, since VA keeps changing my flight reservation, even until 1 day before.  The actual flight that took place was relatively on schedule and on time. Pricing was affordable."
126,ochassot,2,"Despite being part of the Sky Team Alliance, I found Vietnam Airlines to be an archaic airline. The online booking process is not straightforward and user-friendly. If you want to make any change to your booking, you’ll have to visit one of their offices, but bring your passport (physical), because no ID or passport photocopy will allow them to even give you information. My early morning flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Min was late, service onboard was limited to water or this global dark unhealthy soft drink (that’s it, nothing more of a choice), and despite the fact that we bought our tickets to Siem Reap with Vietnam Airlines, they could not check us in all the way through our final destination, which means that we had to get our bags back in Ho Chi Minh, check our luggage and get our tickets at the other airline counter and then pass security again. I honestly do not understand how Vietnamese Airlines claims and maintains 5 stars."
126,myphotos,4,We decided to take the country flag carrier’s to Ho Chi Minh given by its super fare and was surprise that the service render were excellent even to the Economy class passages. <br>Overall the inflight were equivalent from ground to inflight service. <br>Well done VietnamAirlines!!!
126,Li A,3,There is no personal inflight entertainment. Have to ask for a blanket and noticed that it was recycled from previous flight as the blanket was taken from a large bag of other blankets.
126,Li A,4,"Plane was new. Entertainment channels were good. The Japanese lunch was delicious. However, my seat was dirty with leftover crackers on the floor. The crew could have been more 'hardworking' to walk along the aisle to offer plain water or juices to passengers who are awake like another airlines which I have taken before. Also, the crew looked stressed. No smiles from them nor acknowledgment when a thank you was said."
126,sphoorti,1,"I write this review as I wait for my flight to show up at the gate in Hanoi. The original departure time for this flight was 11:30 am, which was pushed to 4:30 pm due to ""technical reasons"" after I booked the flight. I reach my gate for the boarding and slowly see the staff changing the departure time again. This already-delayed flight is now delayed by TWO MORE hours, due to ""technical reasons"". I don't think I have ever experienced this in eight years of international travel. Very disappointed in Vietnam Airlines."
127,Donna A,5,"We travel on Vietnam Airlines whenever we have that option. The premium economy seats and service is terrific. The staff are always helpful and friendly, they never mind getting another G+T. The food is great with a good choice. <br>International flights always seem to be on time. The aircraft are modern and clean with well appointed bathrooms. <br>Definitely worth a try and if you’re transmitting through HCMC, you should include a stop over."
127,HappyFeet S,5,"Have always flew business class with this airline every time I have gone to Vietnam for a holiday &amp; they have lived up to expectations. The service wasn’t as attentive as other times but still very friendly. My lunch was nice - not the best cold meat or salad I’ve tasted on a business flight though. All in all, do recommend this airline."
127,Phil,1,"Just returned from Vietnam and used Vietnam Airlines for our international flights (London Heathrow to Hanoi) and five internal flights.<br><br>For the international flights, the planes were modern and comfortable, the level of service was great and cannot fault in anyway.<br><br>However, this review is for the five internal fights. The airline continuously kept changing the flight times for all our internal flights, sometimes the same flight would change on a daily basis, on top of this, we had paid for extra legroom seats and each time got downgraded to standard seats.<br><br>Thankfully most of the flights were only changed by 5 to 30 minutes so was not too bad, however, our final internal flight from Phu Quoc to Hanoi was cancelled and a new flight was scheduled five hours earlier.<br><br>It is the reason of the cancellation which we had an issue with, in that the cancellation was due to the season change so a new flight schedule was in operation.<br><br>As I booked my flights in August during the summer season they allowed me to book using the current flight schedule, even though the date we were flying on was for a new season and Vietnam Airlines had no intention in operating the flight.<br><br>This now meant we have had a 9 hour stopover at Hanoi to catch our flight back to London which was scheduled to leave at 1:35am, not great.<br><br>Had we known about the real flight we would be taking, we would have booked an entirely new flight plan to avoid such a long stopover.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines did not care in the slightest, they pretty much blamed me for the change in flight. You would think that they could program their online booking system to adjust for such flight schedule changes.<br><br>Pretty poor service overall and a warning to all."
127,@karengarson,5,Staff were very helpful  choice of food was very nice. We were travelling in a Dreamliner and it was very comfortable
127,Sudraka1,5,"Vietnam Airlines is fantastic. Aircraft are clean , comfortable and new, food is great and on board entertainment in perfect. Lighting is relaxing and well thought out. The crew are beautifully dressed , very well presented and offer excellent service. One of the best airlines I have flown.  Stop over in Ho chi Ming is the only downfall as the airport is not great at all."
128,flyboy55,3,"I had high hopes for Vietnam Airlines for our inter-Vietnam trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang (Cam Ranh airport) given their SkyTrax 4-star rating, but they didn't live up to that rating. <br><br>Booking on their website was easy - it's a nice, easy to navigate website.<br><br>About 18 hours before the flight, I received an email saying the flight was delayed.<br><br>Check-in was fast and friendly.<br><br>The Lotus Lounge in SGN was a very nice lounge, with lots of seating, good food and drinks.<br><br>Boarding from the waiting area at the gate was chaotic, as was the bus ride out to our delayed plane. SGN doesn't have nearly the number of jet-bridges the airport needs to handle the number of flights, so nearly all Vietnam Airlines domestic flights are ground-loaded and use busses to get passengers to/from the plane. <br><br>The service onboard was nothing special - mediocrely friendly cabin crew. My seat (2A) was comfortable for a domestic business class seat. Just a drink was offered on the short flight - not even a snack, which was surprising. Arrived over an hour late into Cam Ranh.<br><br>On the return flight, we again received an email about 4 hours before departure saying our flight was delayed - this time for 2 hours. Talking to other travellers on our trip, we discovered Vietnam Airlines is notorious for flight delays, changing flight times on a whim and cancelling flights. I understand VietJet is worse, but we weren't very impressed with this ""4-star"" airline.<br><br>I would only fly them again because I believe they are the safest in Vietnam."
128,travelbob1,2,"The staff involved with check in and gate management were either newbies or inept on this day. <br>100+ passengers needing boarding passes got off two buses with only two check-in lines. For the next 30 minutes no other lines opened and the line barely moved. Each passenger took up to 10 minutes to get a boarding pass.<br>Then another window opened but each passenger was still taking up to 10 minutes to process.<br>When it was our turn the problems became apparent - each passenger was not pre-assigned a seat, many did not have a visa and the airline dealt with each one making the rest of us wait, The staff was referring to written directions, manuals and needing supervisory help.<br>At the gate the staff appeared equally inept at procedures. Lining up for boarding was a mob scene with no attempt by staff to form lines.<br>This experience suggests this is a cheap seat of the pants operation on the ground."
128,ray s,5,"good flight on time, the stewardess were very professional, the food was very good (for airline food)"
128,Violetvz,5,"Always a pleasure to travel with this airline.  They were helpfull, on time and the food was edible :)"
128,Sandy D,5,i have travelled with them many times and never had any problems.<br>easy online check in allows me to book my seat 24 hours in advance at no extra cost.<br>the price of the ticket is also very reasonable.<br>inflight entertainment is very good with plenty selections
129,Thy,1,"Poor customer service<br>Scam you from A-Z<br>Say one thing and the next time they totally take back on their words. <br>First called in for a date change and was told that the addition fee would only be $100. Later through email to confirm, they try to confuse customer by providing two type of currency and adding even more additional fee.  So I tried to cancel my reservation and they reply with a totally different price as a refund that what I have paid in the beginning. They use the excuse of currency rate changes from day to day so the fee they provided in their own currency in your iteraties is only an estimate. I even provided an attachment of the currency rate change stating that the refund amount is incorrect and still, they would not listen  Totally ignorant and arrogant no matter how much you argue even providing proves and still they just had to go with their own ways. Never again for this airline. Such a disgrace to their home country. Stereotypes and rumors from Vietnam are scammers are all true. This should be a 0 star if that was even possible."
129,Chuyen huynh,3,"I had to change my flight date due to unexpected circumstances. Vietnam Airlines calls itself a 4 star world class airline, but it is no better than a 3rd rate, cheap budget airline.<br><br>Here is the reason: if you want to change your flight date, you need to physically go to a credited Vietnam Airlines office. So if the only office is 300 km from where you live, good luck driving there...You cannot change and pay the fee difference online or over the phone with an agent. <br><br>I've travelled half the world with many different airlines. This is the first time I've encountered this problem. <br><br>Like the Vietnam government, Vietnam Airlines is completely inefficient and incompetent..."
129,Christopher P,5,"Shortest way between two points is a straight line and Vietnam Airlines offer that return between Melbourne AU and Hcmc. Good service, on time, and no fuss. I've used them 4 times now international and domestic and will again when I can."
129,Deborah135,4,"We flew Premium Economy on the Dreamliner from London to HCM and returned from Hanoi.  Both flights were on time and went smoothly.  Nice plane with good features like the larger windows and light dimmer instead of blind.  Food was generally ok.  As others have mentioned, not a huge selection on the entertainment system.  Was not a problem on the return leg as the departure was 01.35am so we tried to sleep. We also took 2 internal economy flights (HCM to Danang and Danang to Hanoi) and both left on time and landed as expected.  All in all a good experience with Vietnam Airlines and I would recommend."
129,John,4,Good attentive staff and food was acceptable. Good films to view and all round a good experience. Also had internal flights and back to the UK.
130,Jill B,1,We looked on the website for baggage allowance but when we checked in there was no checked baggage allowed. The queue was horrendous and no signs were clear visits to 3 different counters before we were able to progress. I do not recommend
130,Dario Bento,5,"Always on time.<br>The plane was very decent and the staff very helpful.<br>A hot meal wes served even in a short distance flight. <br>We had no individual entertainment screen, instead, overhead screens are provided."
130,Angie,4,"Though 2 hrs flight , was very happy to be served Hot rice. In flight toilets were clean. Flights were on time."
130,YT N,5,"Seats have very decent leg room. The meal served was good enough along with cold towels, light snacks &amp; drinks. No individual entertainment screen on seat back. Instead, overhead screens at intervals are provided."
130,Ian B,4,"We would normally choose the likes of BA or Emirates for our long haul flights but neither flew directly to Vietnam. We don't mind connecting flights but the direct route and lower prices drew us to Vietnam airlines,  an airline we have never tried. To be honest, the experience was pretty good. We spend extra to fly business on long haul purely because I am over 6 ft and of stocky build and the Mrs isn't the best flyer, so I get more room and she likes to sleep through much of the flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which we have flown on before. The business seats were fairly basic but comfortable with fully flat beds. Not to the standard or finish of the big airlines but certainly adequate. Again,  the entertainment system was ok and the food pretty good. However we found the food of a lesser standard on the return flight. Staff very friendly and helpful. A smooth flight taking off and arriving on time. Everything went very well and given that the cost was significantly less than the other airlines we felt it was more than acceptable and good value for money. Quite disappointed by the airport lounges though, both at Heathrow and Hanoi where we flew back from. The food and drink choices were far below the standard of the bigger airlines,  especially at their flagship Hanoi lounge. Overall though, a decent experience and we would certainly fly Vietnam airlines again."
131,joyfultravel73,5,"I have to say they have great values for budget travels! Both my return flights were on time and convenient. My request for seats at the check-in desks were responded to nicely. I had both the emergency exit and regular seats and the regular seat actually has adequate leg room and seat room. The food was surprisingly good. <br><br>I flew from Denpasar to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh and booked a connecting flight. In Denpasar airport I was told that I only needed to pick up my luggage at my final destination in Hanoi. Upon landing in Ho Chi Minh I was given a “Transit” sticker on my chest and I was told to queue to have my passport stamped, pick up my luggage downstairs and go to the domestic terminal to catch my next flight to Hanoi. I saw the queue and it was about 20 lines with at least 50 people on each line - and it was not moving! I only had 1 hour and 45 minutes until my connecting flight so I asked the airline staff at the transit point again and she confirmed I had to queue. Thankfully I got through after 45 minutes, ran downstairs to pick up my luggage which was waiting for me, and ran to the domestic terminal which was about 5 minutes run (they said 5 minutes walk when I asked how far but having traveled Asia I figured it meant 5 minute run so I ran). I made it to the plane just in time. I was one of the 3 passengers that boarded the plane. It was definitely an adventure! When I was queuing earlier someone told me if I didn’t make it to my connecting flight the airline would definitely put me on the next plane. Well I’m glad I didn’t have to miss it to find out if they would! <br><br>It was fine in the end but I wish I was given the right expectation at the departing airport. Returning was a different case. I was told at the check in counter in Hanoi (I had a transit in Ho Chi Minh) that I only needed to pick up my luggage in Denpasar. I was also given a boarding pass for my Ho Chi Minh - Denpasar flight when I was checking in at the Hanoi airport so when I got to the International Terminal in Ho Chi Minh I went straight to the passport stamp queue without having to check in again. I suppose it’s the government law that sets the difference for inbound outbound travels. <br><br>Most of the cabin crew were friendly. Just a couple of the crew wouldn’t smile or even make eye contact with you. Oh well. It didn’t bother me and I had convenient trips and felt safe. I’d definitely fly with them again for the value."
131,ShanghaiSling,2,Hanoi airport check in is a Zoo. Mobile boarding passes issued by the official Vietnam Airlines app are not accepted (because they are not paper and cannot plane stamped 🤦🏼‍♂️. Flight delay &gt;1 hour. Not a nice way to end our Vietnam travel.
131,Linton C,5,"I would definitely fly this airline again, more legroom than other carriers ie Jetstar, friendly and helpful flight attendants. All together a very smooth and professional airline."
131,Billhartsia,1,"Loaded and took off at 1120 am direct flight to Ho Chi Minh approx 12 hours. Using GMT we were served lunch at 1300 hrs and then did not see any cabin crew again until breakfast. Thats 2 meals in 12 hours. A couple who had obviously flown with them before dug out two Pot Noodle pots and prepped them in the galley and then ate them. There were sandwiches available in the galley (something almost inedible) wrapped in cling film. <br>Returning to London the regime was exactly the same. Served food after an hour and then nothing for another 9 or 10 hours. <br>It gets worse. The plane was running its air conditioning hot and dry and we could not keep up with the liquid required to stop dehydration, and not once did we see any  of the crew offering drinks or checking on the welfare of the passengers, we had to go to the galley to collect water.<br>NEVER AGAIN."
131,Customer909,1,The biggest problem with this airline are:<br>1. lack of smile and engagement from cabin crew. they all look miserable.<br>2. In Flight entertainment equipment not working. It seems as they never check anything as the fault on our system would of been noticeable straight away.<br>3. Food beverage not the greatest.
132,Customer909,2,I thought BA were bad but I am afraid the Vietnam Airline managed to top them. Not once one of them smiled and anything you asked it seems to be OMG why are you asking me that sort of attitude.<br>Food was okay not great. Beverage was limited and had to ask as oppose for them to monitor the cabin.
132,AL-MAROFUL ISLAM,4,"Best airlines among in Viet nam originated airline. I prefer this airline most to travel with in Viet nam. Flight crews are polite, gentle &amp; well behaved. They know how to manage customer in proper way. Must experience this airline, if you plan to visit in Viet nam."
132,DiddyDye,3,Cabin crew were attentive. Food edible. Left on Time Uneventful flight Seat comfortable with enough leg room
132,joe,5,"Have been traveling on Vietnam Air for 3 years and this flight was no different. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable. Food was very tasty and yet light so didn't fill me up too much. Seats were comfortable for economy and also clean. <br><br>Would definitely recommend this airline and itinerary to other travelers!"
132,Nicolai M,5,"We take VietnamAirlines for our flight from Luang Prabang to Siem Reap. For a reasonable (but not cheap) flight, we got a snack, something to drink and thanks to free choice of seats comfortable seats. All in all my experiences with Vietnam Airlines are better than with 5* Carriers like Etihad, Lufthansa or KLM."
133,Jenni M,5,"We flew both international and all domestic flights with Vietnam air.  Plenty on leg room especially for my 6ft friend, no knees hitting the seat in front of her.  Good delicious. Will be flying with them again."
133,Ogilvie56,4,"A great way to fly Business Class on long haul ..... all the creature comforts (maybe not as high a standard as QATAR and the likes) but, at around 2/3 the price, well worth being able to fully recline, good meals and drinks selection. Only down side, the range of entertainment was limited but if you load up your smartphone/tablet beforehand, problem solved - or simply sleep away the hours. Also, if there is an extended layover, Business Class passengers can avail themselves of the Transit program - access to a Hotel, lunch, city tour, dinner in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh at no cost."
133,idbinnyc,4,"It's a bit of a time warm traveling on Vietnam Airlines domestically.  Old A319's with seats straight out of the nineteen-nineties.  The service was fine, and everyone seemed to be able to get on and off the plane just fine.  We flew them several times (not just the route listed) and they were mostly on time. They allow only one checked bag, even in business.  buy snacks in the airport if you need to eat on the plane. Entertainment is what you bring, but heck, its a short flight."
133,Tiff P,2,"Flew from Hanoi to London Heathrow yesterday (left Hanoi at 1.35am from Gate 28). The flight from LHR to Ho Chi Minh was good, with good customer service and attentive staff. However, this was not the case for the return flight. First of all, the power panel under my seat was loose; it had come loose and was only taped on one side, which meant it was dangling. One of the staff told me it was okay but I didn't feel safe with it as this could have been dangerous - very bad health and safety! When the 2 staff members were looking at it, I tried to speak to one of the female staff (about another passenger trying to get through the aisle) but she cut me off and was rude and short with me. <br><br>Second of all, on the flight to Ho Chi Minh, there were a great variety of snacks provided such as biscuits and crackers, plus a full tray of drinks throughout the entire flight. This was not the case for the return flight - as a result, by the time breakfast was served, myself and my partner were very hungry. We were sat in 36 B and 36 C, so right at the back of the plane. We were told by staff that there was no Western option left for breakfast; I had the last one but my partner (nor the passengers behind us) were able to have the Western option. The Asian option was chicken and mushroom congee but it honestly looked disgusting, like cat vomit. The passengers behind us ordered it but did not eat it. Meanwhile, my boyfriend went without breakfast.<br><br>I asked one of the staff members if there were any snacks or other food available; after about 10 minutes she came back and said we could have bread and butter or an instant noodle (not really what you want to eat at 5 in the morning!) At the same time, another member of staff came back with several un-touched food trays from the premium economy cabin. In my opinion, we should have been offered these instead, rather than being told there was no other food available on the plane. My dad also told me that airlines normally do this when food options run out, however this was not offered to us or the passengers behind us.<br><br>Lastly, my partner accepted an offer of coffee, however there was no milk available so we had to wait for that as well. When the stewardess finally gave us milk, she was very sarcastic and rude about it.<br><br>Overall, completely unacceptable lack of customer service and rude staff. Airlines should account for the fact they're likely to have more people requesting the western option and therefore make more of them, or if there's spare premium economy food this should be offered to customers, rather than being told there's no more food left on the plane."
133,Claire W,1,"From ill-informed, aggressive check-in staff, to ageist discrimination, to inedible food to cramped seating.... I could go on.<br>I am a traveller, going from country to country, experiencing the local cultures.  I always have the appropriate visa (if required) and a some what loose itinerary.  I have been doing this for 5 years. I have travelled to every country in SEA, arriving/leaving by air and land transport - whichever is the best option at the time.  I have NEVER pre-purchased an airline ticket.  There has never been any issue with this, from any other airline except Vietnam Airlines.  I requested a supervisor when the check-in person said that I had to have an onward AIRLINE ticket.  This was at HCMC check in. The supervisor was rude and aggresive - shouted at me, demanded that I purchase an onward ticket OR HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO CHECK IN, demanded to see how much money I had in my wallet.  I held my ground, telling him that my plan was to stay in Taiwan for up to 6 months, then to exit by ship to China and then on to Japan etc.  I finally won through, after he insisted that I sign a disclaimer saying that my travel documents were not in order.  He had hand written on the document.  He twice refused to sign the document on behalf of the airline.  By the time I eventually got my boarding pass, I was stressed and shaking.  I suffer from hypertension and stress.  I needed totake medication before I could proceed any further.<br>I had booked a seat with extra leg room for the first leg of my flight, however when preparing to board the check-in person changed my seat number.  I refused to accept this change - I had specifically booked that seat as I am very tall and I suffer from peripheral oedema and sciatica.  I was told, very loudly, that I was too old to occupy the seat that I had booked.  I am 70.  I still refused to accept the change and did indeed travel in the seat I had booked. (This was on the internal leg of the flight, Nha Trang to Saigon).<br>On the second leg, Saigon to Taipei I was seated in an ordinary seat - cramped and uncomfortable the whole trip.  <br>Boarding is a free-for-all!  Herded onto busses, packed in like sardines, driven to the plane, steep stairs to climb with other passengers pushing and shoving.  What a free-for-all fight!<br>The food was dreadful - chicken with rice (the other option was 'fish' which I do not eat) - the chicken was too spicy for me to eat.  The salad (some sort of seafood salad) had some non-descript ingredients which were so unappealing that i did not eat it.  I ate the bread roll and 3 slices of fruit - my 'On Board Meal'.  I was not offered a drink.<br>There is no in flight entertainment - just some screen that drop from the roof area.  You cannot hear what is being said, you cannot even properly see the screen.<br>This is the absolute worst airline experience I have ever had, and would certainly advise all other people not to use this airline."
134,DerHenni,5,"We flew SGN-HUI-SGN and were absolutely satisfied. Tickets were cheap and included luggage, both flights were on time, the staff was friendly and everything was going well. On both flights we got emergency exit seats assigned at no extra costs, so the seat pitch was huge for us. During the flight, free soft drinks are served.<br>I'd fly on Vietnam Airlines again at any time."
134,Helen,4,"When originally booked months ago , flight was scheduled in the morning, then changed to afternoon, whilst waiting at airport it was delayed.<br>Booked with Vietnam airlines as recommended by others as Jetstar have a bad reputation in Australia"

134,rojan0402,1,"Worst airline I have ever travelled with &amp; at 70 I have travelled with many. The food out of Saigon was horrible, tough old pork, powdered scrambled egg ,every thing tasteless , even the beer was terrible.<br>Tried to get seats with more leg space as my wife &amp; I are quite tall. They weren’t even interested in helping us at the checkin, too much of a bother for the young lady checking us in.<br>Finished the flight with sciatica due to the cramped space.<br>Will never travel with this airline again."

135,Nicolás K,5,"I flew twice with them, one from Cambodia to Hanoi and another from Hanoi to Laos, , great in every sense, I would recommend it"
135,Awatchfuleyehomecare,1,This is the worst airline ever. They are in the business of robbing foreigners. They have costly carry on fees. And threaten that if you don’t pay you don’t fly. They loss one of our passports. Once found they accused of of switching passports. They waited for us at the gate and attempted to snatch the passports out of our hands. When this didn’t work they asked to see them and tried to take pictures of them. That didn’t work so they tried to stop us from boarding. We refused to get out of line and said that we would hold the flight up. They finally let us on. If you are a foreigner don’t take this airline you may get stuck. I can guarantee one thing they will get you for extra fees or you will not fly.
135,ericfM4211GV,5,"Many times, my family and me had taken Vietnam Airlines and we always had sastified. You don't need take Air France for having an excellent service. The ticket plane is correct."
135,ronja271,5,I had a problem with the vietnam airlines website and accidentally made two bookings for the same flight. The customer service was incredibly quick to respond and so helpful! They immediately cancelled one of my tickets and gave me a refund and helped me with all further questions. I honestly have never experienced such great service from an airline before!
135,Roger N,5,"Class of service above doesn't give the Premium Economy option on which this review is based.<br>Return flight for our holiday in Vietnam and Cambodia.  Selected on the basis of good value for money and employment of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.  A good service allows seat reservation at the time of booking.  We were certainly not disappointed.  Premium Economy gives Priority boarding  and seats were wide with good legroom.  A good description would be - comparable to old style Business Class prior to the current lay-flat seat beds.  Extremely comfortable and the light programme to help minimise the effects of jetlag works very well.  Service was peasant but to over attentive.  Food was OK but nothing special.  Certainly on our return flight, I think this was economy food.  Entertainment offered a wide range and a good selection of films.  It was a little disappointing to find only the same films when returning a month later.  Internal Vietnam Airlines flight was very good. <br>Our flights with Vietnam Airlines exceeded expectation considerably and this airline is likely to become our regular for future trips to the Far East."
136,Ashlyn,4,"Recently, I flew on 3 domestic flights with Vietnam Airlines:<br><br>Hanoi to Hue<br>Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City<br>Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi<br><br>Experienced some delays, but I've read and heard this is normal for domestic flights in Vietnam.<br><br>All in all, overall experience was what I expected from an inexpensive domestic flight. Nothing overly positive or overly negative.<br><br>To this day, Vietnam Airlines is the only domestic airline I've flown in Vietnam.<br><br>From what I researched ahead of time regarding carry-on allowances and sizes for Vietnam domestic flights, they has some of the most reasonable allowances and sizes for my specific travel needs.<br><br>At the time of my research and flights, their carry-on allowances were the same as the U.S. domestic flights and International Flight baggage allowance sizes I was use to, unlike other Vietnam domestic competitor baggage allowances, which were very small and would cost additional fees if I carried on more than one small item.<br><br>Would fly Vietnam Airlines again. Would recommend."
136,karenprmarketing,5,We flew to Vietnam on a 787 jet. the plane was roomy with a 3.3.3. configuration Plenty of leg room and we where able to utilise exit row seats. But the standard economy seating provided very good leg room on both the international sector and internally on the A350 and A321 planes
136,Stephen N,3,"You would not fly this airline if you had much of a choice. As the airline enjoys a duopoly with Vietjet theie attitude seems to be take it or leave it. I have travelled to Vietnam for the last 11 years and used Vietnam Airlines many times with little satisfaction. My flight from Siem Reap left on time as it was with Cambodian Air, a co share partner. My 4pm flight from H.C.M.City did not board till 4.50PM due to another late arrival and then on board another 30 minute wait to take off due to rain squall. This could have been avoided if the flight took off on time. There seems to be an endemic situation within the airline, I have had many flight rescheduling over the years and not always advised by e-mail."
136,Leon G,4,First time flying with Vietnam airlines and a good airline to fly with.  We did 2 Intl flights and 3 domestic flights - all but one on time.  Aircraft are modern and for economy not bad leg room.  Meals on Intl flights were okay and service was good.  Check in was good all the way though and were very helpful though out our time in Vietnam.  Would fly with them again
136,K J,3,"We did the midnight  Hanoi to Sydney flight at the end of our holiday. The reason I didn’t rate them as a 4 was because of the 43  minute delay on boarding us. The plane was at the gate well before time but the Vietnam airlines staff were very inefficient at boarding us. At no time did they make any announcements about why we weren’t boarding in time ( same when we did the connecting flight Ho Chi Min city to Siam Reap-  Delayed boarding and no announcements) About 20 minutes after we were due to board they slowly took 4 people in wheelchairs inside. It was then another 15 mins before they even started boarding us. People had queued up to board about 30 mins beforehand because I think they were just frustrated and since it was the middle of the night they just wanted to get on the plane. Anyway, once on the plane the staff were friendly, the plane was modern and clean. We also flew to Cambodia and did a flight from Cambodia to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines. I guess I’m spoilt from flying Qantas. Vietnam airlines just seemed inefficient with boarding each time and never made any announcements to let you know what was happening. Next time we’d probably give another airline a try."
137,Maree N Geoff V,3,No real issues. We did 2 international flights Sydney to Hanoi returned HCM to Sydney. Flight was ok but crowded and seats are a bit cramped. Food was average. Staff were efficient and polite. Not all onboard entertainment screens were working properly on return flight to Sydney. Cleanliness was good. Of 4 internal flights we did 2 were delayed but only by less than 2 hrs. All in all we were quite happy with flights.
137,KellieP1269,5,"What a great airline. Nice new planes, excellent staff and meals were good too. Did 2 international and 4 internal domestic and can’t fault any flight"
137,peterli2018,3,"Pretty standard flight with no special extreme bad experiences not any pleasant surprises.  F;light is pretty packed , meal serving is just as normal, cleanliness is acceptable, amenity supplies in the washroom is kind of limited.  All in all, a standrad no frill no nonesens flight journey"
137,brucerenton2015,4,"Flight scheduled at 0845, flight time was about 1hr 30mins. Check in at Hanoi airport (3 large suitcases and 2 carry one was not an issue and very quick.  Cabin staff were friendly polite and a small meal was also served. Plenty of room in economy and plane was of a good standard. No in-flight entertainment available"
137,Nurul A,4,I had been traveling to Vietnam Airlines from Hanoi to Danang. It was nearly one and half hour journey. The air was nice &amp; well coached. The cabin crews &amp; airport correspondents  were all nice to behave. Well air cooling fasting system. But in those hours in flight you will get only a glass of cold water as complimentary else nothing. The flights sometimes get very delay with regular basis. Other wise it's nice to travel with Vietnam Airlines. <br>Thanks.
138,Jolanda,5,"Very good flight from Cambodia to Vietnam; entire process was easy &amp; smooth. From online booking to check-in and from on-time departure to service on-board. Departed in heavy weather and thunder storms, but no issues on board. Coffee, tea and soft drinks on board. <br><br>Great way to move around."
138,Michael K,5,They give you all kinds of goodies and legroom is decent for my 6 foot self. (Not your typical Asian company flight)
138,MelbourneJock,3,"Vietnam Airlines are quite good by World standards. Certainly not Singapore Airlines but better that Jetstar. As in all flights the cabin crew can make a big difference and the crew on the Melbourne to Ho Chi Mingh City were very rushed at all they did even although the flights was 8.5 hours long. Our connection from HCMC to Ha Noi was on-time with efficient cabin crew and ended with the softest landing I can remember. <br>The return flights were quite good, nothing exceptional, and reasonable. The biggest problem was the language as the cabin crew's English wasn't at all good but we flew Jetstar from Honolulu to Melbourne last year the the cabin crew's English was, if anything, worse that Vietnam Airline's.<br>Boarding at HCMC was really labourious for some reason with stop-start the order of the day with stop at one stage lasting a good ten minutes. <br>There is a lot of work being done that the different airports we flew into and disembarking was generally onto the tarmac and bussed into the terminals. I guess once the work has been completed that will be dispensed with.<br>If we were to go back to Vietnam I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
138,Randy P,3,"My return flight from Dalat to Ho Chi Minh City was not the best for a top tier airline like Vietnam Airlines.<br>Especially for business class.  Flight attendants weren’t very attentive. <br>1. Flight attendant asked what we wanted to drink. My simple request was for coffee with cream and sugar.  They came back to deliver the coffee only to tell me they had no sugar! and that they forgot to get some!! I mean, not 1 packet of sugar on that plane? I didn’t see them go back to the economy section to check if maybe there was some there. And bright the coffee anyway, instead of asking if we still wanted the coffee w/o the sugar.<br>2. When it was time for descent for landing, flight attendants didn’t come around to make sure we had our seat backs in the upright position, didn’t come around to take away finished or unfinished drinks in glass container. So when the plane landed, the gentleman’s glass of water next to me, flew off the table and spilled on the floor and my feet. Luckily the glass didn’t break. and flight attendants did nothing."
138,F7X,2,"This particular 787 was built in 2015, it’s had its first 36 month inspection most and likely another inspection. Judging by looking at the filter literally right beside my seat, tells me it’s probably never been looked at since new. The pictures don’t do any justice all I see is mold, extreme heavy dust all along the side of the seat.<br><br>Service was above standard but this particular airplane from a cleanliness point of view in my opinion was not good. What made me look there? when I observed the business class seats and the carpet it appeared they looked like they’ve had no attention since the aircraft was delivered. <br><br>Hopefully someone in Vietnam Airlines will see this and do the right thing, I spent thousands of dollars on a business class ticket and this is what I observed. I can only imagine what the drinking water is like, pipes have probably never been flushed or cleaned."
139,Hanh Van Pham,5,"This is my first time flying business class. Hence I do not have much experience with luxury on the sky. But Vietnam Airlines definitely made a great job:<br>- Plenty of choices for food during lunch and breakfast.<br>- Excellent meals: So much tasty food.<br>- Diverse kinds of drinks, especially liquors; delicious cocktails.<br>- Very comfortable seat which could become flat-bed.<br>- Clean toilet<br>- In-flight entertainment with lots of movies<br>- Friendly, attentive and enthusiastic flight attendants.<br><br>Small issue: Menu should state which food is spicy. I accidentally ordered some spicy food while I could not eat spicy."
139,Michael K,5,Our start in Sydney could have been a disaster due to weather cancellation of connecting Qantas flight from Brisbane ( I had allowed 4 hours transfer) and then lost bags on QF flight offered. I kept in constant contact with VN desk in Sydney advising of status. We arrived Sydney 40 mins before VN Departure - no bags! Bags arrived next flight - down to 20 mins before departure ! Arrived VN desk 10 mins before departure - they reopened flight - issued boarding passes and rushed us thru customs etc. to board 2 mins before departure. Without tht effort - holiday was dead in water.  Excellent flights on VN 787 aircraft ob sectors Syd - Hanoi - Moscow and return.  Great Hanoi layover service on return flight - very good on board food / cabin service - in flight entertainment and full flat lay back bed. 787 lighting sets you up for correct time of arrival with lighting and fully dimming cabin windows. Air quality in 787 excellent. Well recommend Vietnam Airlines long haul flights. I might add this flight was very much less cost than Other Airlines for Syd - Moscow and return. Two even flights around 9 hours each.
139,sharne s,3,We  actually flew  premimum economy and the extra leg room was ver6 good ....in comparison to other carriers the service was average . My concern is linked to the return flight which left Saigon . I5 is a  ‘quiet ‘ airport which makes communication difficul5 ...we were told that ourflight was delayed because of ‘ technical problems ‘ which alarmed us : when we finally boarded the plane we were told it was because passengers from a connecting flight were late ....my stress levels b6 this stage were high and I found the way that i5 was managed was less than satisfactory.
139,Katrin T,3,"First we flew to Hanoi, then we took a domestic (still with VA) to Da Nang. The international flight was okay. Legroom was okay, food was okay. If I remember correctly, they don't provide personal entertainment. Service was pretty good. <br>But the domestic one was late. There was no meal since it was a short flight. And we arrived late. Overall, the trip was average."
139,extravelagent,4,"Ok let me start this review by saying I wanted to find the cheapest way to get from Hanoi to Saigon. Actually. I was also looking for Saigon to Danang and then Danang to Hanoi. VietJet came up super cheap and like $35 a person on each leg. I booked Saigon to Danang on VietJet and then told a Vietnamese friend of mine. He gave me a look and then said ""you gonna be delayed"" on Vietjet. I then started to look at the reviews on Vietjet and saw that practically all the reviews complained about the delays. Since we were on a tight schedule I decided to eat the VietJet costs and book all my flights on Vietnam Airlines as the reviews about delays were non existent. The flights of course we a bit more per person (about $20 more) but it was piece of mind (or more of a gamble) that the flagship carrier of Vietnam would get us to our destinations on time. All three flights we took on Vietnam Airlines were on time, planes were comfortable and staff not surly. The only flight that we got fed was the 2 hour Hanoi to Saigon and it was rice dish of some sort. You get to roll on 1 carry on FOC up to 26 pounds and first check in bag was $20 (prepay 6 hours before your flight for this cheap flight). Everything was fine so if you want to take flights that are fairly on time and are big comfortable planes, Vietnam Airlines is the way to go. Side note: Since I had double booked Saigon to Danang I kept watching the original VietJet flight I booked and it was delayed by 2.5 hours while our Vietnam Air was on time!!!"
140,michael h,5,"Our family had a summer holiday for our kids to Singapore and Malaysia in about 2 weeks. From the moments of check in at Hanoi Noi international airport we got a great service from the staff of Vietnam airline we felt very surprised and so happy for this because we traveled with our kids so they had rnew regulations that going with kids will have priorities no need to wait for long queue . Because of this we had very fast check in with smile faces of the staff. We got inside the plane which was so huge and very clean, we found our seats very easy. During flight about 3 hours we all felt very comfortable indeed with very professional pilot when he landed off the plane. We also had free meals n drinks on plane too that was amazing we got all we need on our flight just asked the flight attendants who are always willing to help you with their beautiful smiles. Thank you Vietnam airline for your great service. Keep up the good work . Highly recommended to everyone.i will definitely choose VietnamAirlines flights for our next time traveling!!!"
140,187147George,4,This was delayed because of weather conditions. The board became a bit of a lotteries for BC passenger- one of- but in flight was comfortable and there was a soft drink/ beer offered
140,Gungging,1,"I’m writing here to tell the true story that shouldn’t have happened..<br><br>My group and I bought flight tickets directly with Vietnam Airlines for BKK-NRT-BKK, 5 months prior to the traveling date. The flight indicated a connecting flight in Hanoi. However, one of your associates contacted me asking for a kind cooperation to change the connecting point from “Hanoi” to “Ho Chi Minh City” which I granted the flexibility. With the trust for the national airline’s reputation, I didn’t expect any unacceptable incidents. Anyhow, the situation my group and I have just faced changes my perception of your company.<br><br>What my group and I have encountered is highly disappointing. Without prior notice, the flight was 8 hours delayed, which basically forced us to cancel all the plans we had for the first traveling day including all paid programs. During the delay, there was no meal or allowance compensation. I was provided with a poor-conditioned room that I needed to change in the middle of the night due to malfunctioning AC. So far, there’s no allowance fee or other compensation for my group for this inconvenience whatsoever. Over the waiting period, we continually asked for updates of the delay, no apology nor explanation was extended. I cannot fathom that this is the service provided by a national airline and I will not accept this.<br>Upon the ponder, my other 2 cousins who made a transit in Hanoi arrived Narita and enjoy their trip in Japan already!<br><br>We are beyond disappointed with your service at this point. The 8 hours that we lost while waiting for the flight to go to Japan have never been explained. Time is a precious commodity. I demand a good explanation about this situation and a compensation for my group and I (total 6 persons) immediately.<br><br>I trust Vietnam Airlines will do the right thing for the passengers."
140,Rickmatt,4,"We often budget for Premium Economy on international travel and so glad we did so with Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>Propriety boarding ,  Plenty of leg room ,  team are very attentive and the meals are not to bad for an airline.<br><br>Amenities pouch handy ,  little extras in the bathrooms like razors and toothbrush’s , however that is in the amenities pouch they give you.<br><br>Inflight entertainment has a good choice and what’s great about the premium economy is the seating configuration 2 - 3 - 2 <br><br>I would only say that they need to fix what’s broken ,  like foot rests and arm rests these are 787-9 Dreamliner they are looking neglected."
140,Smoothsailn,2,Planes smell like dirt. <br>Cancelled flight to Hanoi and gave us a lunch voucher that they would not take after we waited 2 hours. They don’t empower employees to make good decisions. Finally got us on plane 5 hours later👎
141,Helen Y,2,"Overall, this airline is punctual and food is good. My two complaints are: (1) stewardess, Ai Xuan, took a long time (about 10 minutes) to serve food instead of moving out of the way for two passengers to pass through; and (2) stewardess, Nhat Van, refused to give a passenger a blanket when asked. Van replied that blankets are limited and there are other passengers. However, hardly any passengers asked for a blanket, and she pulled out a lot of blankets from the overhead compartments."
141,Masa,1,"There is no other airplane company which refuses an air gage for  scuba diving for baggage.<br>  It is nonsense to conclude that an air gage is a  dangerous article.<br>Air gages are connected to regulators for  scuba diving . If you ban the air gages for baggage, you automatically ban regulators.<br> This company should change the illogical regulation before it looses many divers guests."
141,Janice R,5,"I looked at reviews of Vietnam Airlines to check that they had in-flight entertainment or whether I needed to take my own. There were so many bad reviews comparing it to a budget airline so I felt compelled to write my own. Both flights were virtually on time, it’s a large plane with good leg room and very large overhead lockers. The staff are beautifully presented, they are happy to give drinks and snacks when not part of the trolley service. The food was good and there was a large selection of entertainment choices. The only thing I would say is that the film and tv choices are not as good as other airlines but still plenty of choice. Don’t worry about using Vietnam Airlines-they are brilliant and direct flights from Heathrow which is a real advantage!"
141,TravelswithSue,4,"Vietnam Airlines has struck gold with their expanding fleet of Dreamliner aircraft.  These comfortable planes have roomier seating, more reclining and get one to a destination in pretty good shape.  My feet do not swell on these aircraft, and the smart windows allow me to darken the glass to cut out the glare. The food is usually tasty and the service has always been caring.  If flying to Vietnam, this is my airline of choice.  I have been lucky to score flights on the dreamliner aircraft when flying to Hanoi as well....it just makes flying so much more comfortable."
141,stephane3361,1,"I flew from Hanoi to Bangkok yesterday. Flight was horrible, no smile from Cabin Crew. One staff Nguyen Duy did not speak basic English. No customer care training.<br>This is my second bad experience with that 3rd world airline. Last year I flew HCM to Bangkok and I had the same bad experience. Fly Thai Airlines, much better service and attitude....with a smile!"
142,International Yoga Travel,3,"For some reason they had two entrances onto this plane, which had 50 something rows in it. It was pandemonium as people climbed over each other and the worst of humanity came out in people as every became so frustrated with the mayhem. I think this was an anomaly, because the gate and plane got switched at the last minute. Once we were all finally seated, though, the flight was fine. Very nice plane, seemed like it was new. Flight attendants were great. Just a very weird boarding experience."
142,Andy From Aus,4,"Vietnam Airlines economy was comfortable enough for the short flight from Sydney to HCMC. There is a decent amount of leg room in economy to be able to stretch out ever so slightly. We had the obligatory TV screens to use with a plethora of shows to watch. Strange thing is they do not give you headphones until the plane is at cruising altitude - weird. <br>The food is like most others, meh. But it’s served at altitude where our tastebuds are not as effective, so it’s just stomach filler really. <br>The staff are wonderful and DO speak enough passable English to assist when and where necessary and are quite pleasant. <br>We flew on 6 different flights throughout Vietnam and had nothing but great service from the ground staff to the cabin crew - we will recommend Vietnam Airline indeed."
142,Bruiser1966,4,Used Vietnam Airlines travelling home after a tour of Vietnam. Very comfy and quiet flight home. My one gripe was that I was woken up for a breakfast of which the option I wanted had run out anyway. Need a larger choice of western breakfast as the rear section of plane didn't get any. Otherwise all good.
142,Marek,1,"Extremely poor service, Employees don't speak English, when I say I have a problem at the airport been told to go in the office in the city centre.. Never again with them"
142,Larry Lim,5,A good choice for this destination. After all it's the national airline. Aircraft was a <br>Boeing 787 a comfortable large aircraft for this route. Economy was good set up with reasonable room. Very efficient cabin crew and we were well looked after.
143,BCG,5,"I have been flying Vietnam airlines for just over a year now and have enjoyed every flight (about 7). I’m lucky that I’m able to fly business class and can highly recommend them. <br>The staff are excellent, efficient and friendly. <br>Seats are super comfortable and the menu has a range of western and Vietnamese items. <br>Champagne could be better but that is probably being picky."
143,tarbaugh2018,3,"Each of my domestic flights were quite full and while the young women in my row were less than friendly and acted entitled to a row of their own, the airline was nice and clean and the staff was friendly."
143,Zendy,4,Vietnam Airline is always our safe choice for domestic flight. <br>Staffs were friendly and provided great service. Seat was comfortable for my size.<br>Not much on-flight entertainment but it was ok for a 1hr~ flight. <br><br>We already booked another flight to Da Nang next month for a family break :) Would recommend if you travel within Vietnam.
143,OzKK,2,"Rating due to my experience and may not be the case with another aircraft.<br>For me I had problems sadly from the beginning. My assigned seat fell back and would not hold upright. A safety risk so asked to move which they 'eventually' did... then next seat the recline and foot rest was not working - so after inflight moved again.<br>The entertainment of movies had not been loaded correctly and so only a couple of english movies that were old were available. If you had children then there was NO childrens programs available.<br>I wrote to Vietnam Airlines to ask if they would check the interior functions before aircraft leave Vietnam outbound, but they seemed to think they had no problem ... Thus the reason for my poor rating. As I said other trips may be fine for others."
143,Leander,4,Very nice and new airplane. Both flights were characterized as almost on time and very caring during preparations. With kids you get the birst line seats at ECO class with a special carriage for Babys. Although they denied us to let the older one sleep at the floor we still have a positive experience.
144,PeterAus68,4,"Fair value. Crew were good, food and wine ok but not outstanding. Flat bed in a fairly tight ( I’m not small ! ) cocoon. Good size screen but only average ,limited selection.<br>The 14 hour stopover in HCM city is of questionable value . <br>Would we do it again ?  Maybe but not sure. .... it’s ok but not Singapore,Emirates or Qantas standards but it is considerably cheaper."
144,L9816MYbobr,4,"We flew Premium Economy Vietnam Airlines from London to Hanoi, then plain economy class to Tokyo from Hanoi. Both experiences were very good indeed (Premium Economy was obviously a step up but both were pretty comfortable). The airline cabin staff were absolutely first class and could not have been more attentive. On the basis of those flights I would recommend this airline."
144,shogun41,3,"I paid quite a bit of extra money for the upgrade as this was a long flight and we are both over 60yrs of age and we wanted to be comfortable.  Unfortunately my seat was broken and would not recline and I had to remain upright for over 11 hours.  I had swollen ankles for 2 days.  The attendant tried to resolve this by offering me an alternative seat next to an unknown male, when he could have sat in my husband's seat and we could have moved to his row where there were 2 seats available.  Food was good but the in-flight entertainment kept cutting out and we could'nt watch a whole film.  Not worth the high price of the tickets."
144,Bernie S,3,"This was our 5th flight with Vietnam Airlines in 3 weeks and on 3 of them we had problems with check in. At one stage the 3 of us were sitting in 3 separate areas of the plane. eventually they got my wife and daughter together. when on the plane by luck the lady sitting next to me had the same problem as us and her sister was sitting somewhere else, so i changed with her which got me closer to my family. I then swapped with the man next to my family and finally we had done what the Airline couldn't. The flight was great with staff great with service."
144,Vincent G,4,"Be careful with the checked luggage, they only accept 15kg, so if you are visiting from aboard and pack 20 or 23kg, be prepare to pay extra.<br>For another luggage, they charge me 500.000 dong (~$40)"
145,ARW227,5,"We travelled to Vietnam from Australia in economy but decided to upgrade to business class for an overnight flight on our return. It was spacious, comfortable and the service and meals were all good. <br>It was not overly expensive and my wife and I were happy to pay a bit extra just to have a decent nights rest."
145,G-Rom,5,"The staff was attentive to our requests and even proposed me a seat more suitable for my legs. The food was tasty. A number of movies proposed in a variety of language including French, Japanese, Korean, German... Airlines to be recommended."
145,Viacheslav Z,1,Came to airport 3 hrs before arrival on Oct 7. Huge queue to check in counters. Have seen similar queue only to Ho Chi Minh mausoleum. Total disaster. No VN employees to guide pax and manage the situation. Locals are trying to get in front with poker faces. It was joint with ANA flight. Should be shame for HN (ANA).
145,Ross,4,We were upgraded to a front seat (more leg room.) Seat comfortable food great for economy out of Sydney but poor coming home out of Vietnam.
145,murielcsmith,4,"We had a late morning flight which was on time, a lunch which was fine but fairly shortly after, the cabin lights were turned off and the cabin crew disappeared ! I wasn't ready to sleep at 3pm but it was difficult to do anything, The films were poor and it was too dark to read.. It was a long while before the crew re-appeared to serve supper which was the usual 2 choice meal. The seats were comfortable and the flight was on time., Return flight was about 1am but was late taking off, arriving a little late in London. We had a meal fairly soon after taking off and nothing until breakfast. We were sitting near the back and they had run out of the eggs and bacon option - very disappointing as we were quite hungry and did not fancy noodles and chicken. <br>We chose Vietnam Airlines because we could catch a direct flight and they were reasonably priced, They provided blankets and pillows, but quite difficult to sleep at odd times! Plenty of leg room and toilets were in good order. Would probably use the airline again."
146,Peter,5,A young airline flying the most modern Airbus Jets is setting a new standard of service and confidence. I used Vietnam Airlines on various flights during my 8 months stay in Eastern Asia and every time I get impressed again. The became my primary airline to use in eastern asia.
146,Judy D,4,"My family and I flew to Vietnam both ways on vietnam airlines. It was a comfortable flight during the 9hrs. The food was enjoyable going over however could only offer chicken and rice on the flight back as they had run out of other choices, not the best for breakfast. <br>Also found during the long flight water was not offered enough I thought.<br>It was nice to have a pillow and blanket provided for comfort."
146,Cheryl Rostron,4,"We flew premium economy to London and thought it was great value for money. only 4 hour stop over in Hanoi and onto London. Seats are comfortable and the staff and food were great, truly value for money."
146,Explore08985616754,3,"The flight over to Vietnam from Bris/Sydney was fine. here is plenty of leg room for a economy flight. Food was fine. No problems.<br>However, the flight home to Australia was not. First, just as we were taxiing out of the terminal, we hear a loud noise and the plane was swaying all over the place. We stopped, no explaination. Sat in the plane for an hour before we finally took off. Pretty well straight up we were fed etc,all good. I was seated toward the back of the plane. Across from me was a young teenager who was obviously very sick with the flu. I didn't think he should have been travelling at all, let alone on a plane full of people.This boy coughed and sneezed most of the way home except for when he was sleeping. Isn't it up to the hostess to monitor people like this and move them. Hence, now I have the flithy flu. Trying to sleep, male hostess sat and talked all night,keeping people awake. Our flight was 1 hour late &amp; we missed our connecting to domestic. No dutyfree as we were running to catch our flight as ordered by airline staff. The rest of the flights to Bris were booked out for the day. After hours of sitting in Vietnam Airlines head office, we were booked on a flight the next morning. We had to be booked into a hotel for night. This was all at the expense of V/A. We were all so glad to get home"
146,Lauren Cannell,5,Used to fly from Melbourne to Vietnam direct and return.  Flew economy on the way over and premium economy on the way home as it was a night flight and wanted more room to sleep.  It was definitely worth it for a night flight.  Food and drinks were excellent and the staff were very attentive.  I was able to sleep on a flight for the first time in my life!
147,robjude2017,4,Recently returned from a 2 week holiday in Vietnam on Vietnam Airlines and was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the flight and food provided.  I can recommend this airline to people flying.  The only issue I had was serving of food at 1:30am (11:45pm flight) but most passengers seemed to be eating so must have been just me thinking it was time for sleep.
147,jackieb02,1,"Vietnam airlines flight 921 was delayed due to technical difficulties. For 2 hours and 45 min we had no updates, then at 2:45 we were told we would get a flight at 4:30 ( original flight was 12:10). To pacify customers they took us to a dirty and disgusting restaurant where I refuse to eat.<br>Meanwhile my flight from Ho Chi min VN 607 was scheduled for 4:50, so we couldn’t make that flight anymore, and we were told that the flight was the last one from Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok! So where we are staying in Ho Chi Minh?!! not a clue!! Mind you there are flights from Vientiane direct to Bangkok that Vietnam airlines could have arranged for us, but talking to any of the agents is worthless!!!<br>They have our luggages, and we were told that should we miss one leg of the flight the other flights would be nullified!<br>This is an easy fix for Vietnam airlines if they wanted to or were inclined to working with the passengers.<br>This is mediocre work, poor customer service, and the worse flight and reaction I have ever gotten from an airline."
147,Antoinette W,3,"I chose this airline because of reliability and safety records, but also expected full service as the price was double that of the competitors. Only cola, lemonade or water, nothing else on a 2 hour flight."
147,Ian W,4,"Nice aircraft with ample leg room for our trip to Vietnam. The female crew members on the flight didn't really look like they wanted to be there, a vast difference to the male crew members. Overall a good airline to fly with."
147,Hilla B,5,"We had a 12 hour flight leaving at mid-night so as soon as we were airborne I put my seat flat and went to sleep.  During my waking hours the service and food was very good making for an enjoyable flight.  The lounge was a nice plus waiting for our departure with comfortable seating, internet and enjoyable Asian foods."
148,Hilla B,5,We had a 12 hour flight that was comfortable with very good service and a choice of Asian and western foods.  The flight attendants were friendly and made sure that were were well taken care of.
148,MgY,5,"The staff was very friendly. Check in was a breeze. Boarding was quick.  flight was on time, seats comfortable and attendants were friendly."
148,aussieboone,5,"Our flight included 2 international and 2 domestic flights. From the time of checking in at Sydney for the flight to Ho Chi Minh and returning from Hanoi, Vietnam Airlines staff were professional, courteous and helpful. We managed to upgrade through Uptown.com to premium economy and would not fly economy again, the seats were comfortable, service was first class and the extra leg room was a god send for the 8 1/2 hour flights, before departing we were given a small pack with a toothbrush and paste, sleeping eye masks, and slippers with socks and a couple of other nik naks.<br>The meals on all flights were tasty and the drinks on the international flights were welcoming.<br>All up we would definitely fly Vietnam Airlines again and would not hesitate in recommending Vietnam Airlines for future flights."
148,Angran X,1,"I will give negative if I can, man, those flight attendants are RUDE. I traveled a lot places in the world and flied different airlines but honestly these VN flight attendants shocked me. Everyone of them looks upset and impatient, and everyone of them are yelling ever since we get on board. During 4 hours of flight, they gave one round of drink/snack, one meal, and the rest of the time, they all sit at back of the airplane playing their cell phones. Almost all the passengers are from inland China who can not understand any English, this does make it difficult to communicate, but God, no passenger deserve to be treated like that. I complained to one girl that it is not right to yield at people like that but I did not see any improvement. Very bad experience."
148,Judy G,5,"We flew Premium Economy for the first time and wow! It was definitely worth the extra cost. Huge layout seats, footrest and so much room to move!<br>Also our baggage went Sky Priority &amp; we were directed to the Business Class line which had first access to boarding. A cold drink and hand towel were given to us on boarding. Will be hard now to fly Economy after this treat!"
149,garyike,5,Even though the flight is Only 95 minutes long they had 6 flight attendants and were Right there to help with any request. And luggage and a meal were included. Without a doubt a great airline
149,davidjclarke2017,5,"Flew London - Ho  Chi Minh City and Hanoi-London return in Business and was not disappointed. Attentive service, good menu choice and a really comfortable flat bed!<br>The Entertainment system may not offer the number of choices available on other Airlines but this more than enough for a 12 hour flight!  Travelling on the Dreamliner is a great  experience anyway."
149,bilby2009,5,"I've flown with Vietnam Airlines a few times now from Sydney to London and back home again. For Australian's the business class airfare is cheaper than most other airlines and the service is very good. The food is also very good and they have the seat go to flat bed in business. Entertainment system is not as extensive as some other airlines, but there was still reasonable amount to watch.<br><br>When returning from London to Sydney your baggage is checked through to Sydney and they have a transit program for passengers (you arrive around 5.30am in the morning, your flight back to Sydney is around 8.45pm that night - ensure to take some hand luggage with change of clothes). This gets booked through your travel agent - included your airfare are the transit visa, day hotel stay, lunch and dinner meals (up to a certain value), a few hours tour of Ho Chi Minh city and transfer back to the airport.<br><br>They also generally have an asian option in the meals offered as part of their menu."
149,AshleyHenkel,5,"Always a pleasure to step aboard Vietnam Airlines, flying internationally or domestically in Vietnam."
149,CJSYD,5,"We have just completed our second return trip from Sydney to London, the first at Christmas last year. Initially wary, I discovered that the new Dreamliner aircraft was used on the SYD-LHR route and reviews were positive. We can buy business class lay flat seats far cheaper than other major airlines, so we thought we'd try it. Service was excellent, as was the food.  We had fresh towels, both warm and cool several times throughout the flight. We find the window seats better than the centre seats, as the window seats have air vents above and a little more leg room. All flights have been on time and drama free, except for my final flight a few days ago from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney. After takeoff I discovered that my seat was broken, it had no power to recline or lay flat, and as the business cabin was full I couldn't move to another seat. To their credit, 2 flight attendants spent 15 minutes manually laying my seat down so that I could sleep, it was not an easy task for them. The layovers in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City are long, around 15 hours, but their transit program is excellent. Visas are organized, then transport to a 4 star hotel for rest and meals, as well as a City tour and then return to the airport. They honestly put some of the major carriers to shame."
150,Darcey W,1,NEVER EVER AGAIN! Three couples from Saskatchewan book flights to Vietnam (6 months in advance). Planning a great vacation to Vietnam. Vietnam Airlines partners with China Airlines. When checking into our flights we realize 2 of the 3 couples aren’t seated with our spouses? So we tried to change seats at the airport without success. <br>Bottom line if you book economy with Vietnam Airlines or China Airlines you’re treated like crap. This issue absolutely ruined our vacation. We’re looking forward to the trip home because it will probably happen again. <br>In closing NEVER BOOK WITH EITHER AIRLINES EVER
150,petcpetc,3,"Currently highest tier status with vn lotus frequent flyer prog.<br><br>So far I am OK with the in flight crew. Not much complain on them. I am not really a fussy type. Usually won't complain much. <br><br>But their flight arrangement,  customer service n their recognition of their loyal customers is a joke.<br><br>Highlight a few instances.<br><br>Many times, switching 787 for a 321. Sin-sgn-sin sector ( last flight of the day ).<br><br>I book econ class on a domestic flight. My wife couldn't make it n left me flying with my baby. During booking, I clearly selected AB seat for myself n wife. Some how when I check in they gv me a different row right in the center seat. My wife ticket is not refundable. So least I expect to be given the requested seat. Instead I got stuck in the middle with baby on my lap with two guys sitting left n right of me. I think the ground agent got to think of situation n some priority for their platinum tier members.<br><br>Beijing to ho chi minh (bz class). As there's no direct flight from Beijing to hcm. It Beijing to hanoi to hcm on Vietnam airline. Beijing out bound delayed, thus unable to catch the last flight Hanoi to ho chi minh. End up staying overnight at Hanoi.

No offer of hotel accommodation, no apologies from a representative etc. I can afford few hundred dollars of hotel accommodation, but least we expect some apology or some offers of assistance. None.<br><br>Canton to sgn. Bz class. First booking for my wife went thru. On my booking, I was unable to select the sit next to her. Inform airline office to put request a wk before departure, they usually will block some seat on the sys.

I been redeeming Kris flyer miles instead.<br><br>As I fly north asia quite often, sky team members include Korean air, China eastern, China airline, xiamen airline etc is quite useful. I think for those thinking of joining skyteam, choose airline frequent flyer that most benefit u. Considering some will charge fuel surcharge n tax, points, sectors etc."
150,Dman1995,5,"As an avid viewer of “Air Crash Investigations” I was somewhat cautious to step away from the big players. Vietnam Airlines was amazing - Brand new Dreamliner with very friendly service, tasty food and a comfortable ride all the way. Literally the only downside was that cabin announcements were so quiet you missed every 2nd word - I can live with that!"
150,blueboya14,4,"Would definately fly with airline again.   The staff were very attentive, the service exceptional and the meal as good as say airline I’ve flown with"
150,Wahyu P,5,Completed enough n tasty foods especially for us as a Moslem who cant eat pork.  They serve us with Fish n beef. Nice crews.....
151,Bridge324,4,"Two hour flight, easy no hassle check in and gate processing.  They sat us together which was fine.  In flight meal and drinks served, all complimentary, landed with no fuss.<br>Airbus, relativity new, clean, friendly staff.  Great."
151,KingKongNYC,4,"Great flight , alot of leg room. Service in the plane is great . The only part I don't understand is by the time we got into Hanoi the plane pull into the gate. But the hanger didn't attach to the plane. They still want us to take the stair and board a bus and take us into the terminal. Guess they need to save money."
151,bd415,4,"Checkin staff very helpful and understanding helping us sort our last minute visa issues.  Good inflight food, pleasant in-flight service"
151,Peter_CUA,5,"Very easy check in at DaNang and transfer at Hanoi, luggage goes straight through to London. We flew Economy plus which was very comfortable with plenty of leg room and excellent in flight service, free food and drinks even on the short flight to Hanoi.<br>The crew were very charming and attentive. I can highly recommended this Airline"
151,Vu N,5,"Service and air plane and timeliness were great. I have seen the company improve over time. Compared to other options to fly within Vietnam, this airline is more expensive but flights are much likely to be on time and have shorter delays than other airlines."
152,Vipatum l,3,"When you transit at Hanoi , you need to security pass for  checking belonging ,hand carry bag, and scan your body at Hanoi again, same as the passenger who fly from Hanoi.  So when you come back from Japan, you will concerning this point before you buy the goods from Japan and carry with yours.<br><br>I meet the horrible time when fly from Bangkok to Nagoya and transit at Hanoi , they open my bag and check it for 2 time.  And there are many people in line to pass the security line , it's boring time."
152,terry hooper,4,aircraft was clean and well prepared.  flight crew were courteous and polite but somewhat aloof when spoken to.  could have been their lack of ability to speak fluent english.  in flight entertainment was excellent with great selection and very upto date selections.
152,mm1esg,3,"I liked the 30 kg luggage allowance and the whole package was not discernibly better than other airlines' services. <br><br>Staff seems to get boni for saving drinks and snbacks - or some individual stewart was hogging noodle soup cups? He denied me a cup - and I wonder, why?<br><br>It left a bitter taste in my mouth.<br><br>Years earlier, Vietnamese would discard used toilet paper on the floor. (Shared SKY TEAM flights with Air FrAnce).<br><br>Compared with THAI, I will choose THAI any day."
152,trendell26,2,"Check in was reasonably swift at Terminal 4. But onboard the “service” was poor. The flight departed at 1100, the crew rushed out with meals drinks etc, then turned the lights right down to get us to go to sleep, at 1430!! Even if you were on Vietnam time it made no sense. But it meant there was zero service for the next six hours while the crew slept! The hot food was cold. The crew were miserable and unfriendly. The safety briefing was ineffective."
152,Jo50,3,"Food was excellent, good western and Asian choices, and plenty of drinks. Seat sizes were small and cramped, I’m not fat but they seemed awfully narrow. Entertainment options were limited - not many really good films and far too many action fantasy type - great if that is what you like. I would have been interested to watch some of the Asian films but none of the ones I was interested in had English subtitles. Games are difficult to play as there is no pull out controller, just the touch screen which gets tiring. Staff were attentive and helpful. The flight was completely full, 12 hours long and frankly a pretty awful experience- I think I am going to have to start saving up for business class in the future."
153,The-Mong-Melbourne-Australia,5,"These guys are sensational, I am 6’4” and in economy had a clear 2 inches to the seat in front. Great service, nice meals - and in economy I asked for a bloody mary and they made it on the spot - including the tabasco, worchestershire and pepper. You can’t ask more than that!...well I did and had 2 of them. I paid AUD$750 for MEL&gt;SGN&gt;HAN&gt;SGN&gt;MEL. Minto and highly recommend. Last time I flew Jetstar and when I come back again, for the price, why would I ever go with Jetstar again. I saw a few wankers complain about business lounge etc...seriously some people think they are rockstars,if you are not pretentious just get on with it and book them! cheers Mong, Melbourne Aust"
153,Jeanette S,4,"To begin with, the food in the business lounge was very disappointing. The flight was fairly average. The staff were polite but not very friendly. There wasn’t a big selection on the menu and they didn’t give any time for you to look through it as they just stood there with pen and paper waiting for you to choose. Also not a big selection of movies to choose from. Our return flight home was an overnight trip and the ‘bedding’ was like a very thin doona to sleep on whereas Emirates give you a thin foam mattress. <br>Overall they were better than Singapore Airlines but nowhere near as good as Emirates."
153,Ken F,3,"We were headed to Cambodia (package deal) and much to our surprise, we were flying with a SkyMiles partner. At check-in I noticed that the lady mistyped my SkyMiles number and I kindly made her aware of her mistake. Turned out that our SkyMiles numbers were never added to the ticket. She probably didn't know what she was doing. The flight itself was good. We had enough space. There was the aisle between us, so we were not sitting next to eachother. We were never asked if this was o.k., which was a bit of a bummer.<br>The entertainments system was nothing to be mentioned. Only a few films in the language my Lady prefers. Most of them were in English, so I had no troubles, but the variety sucked.<br>The food was good and plentiful, but I must say that I'm not picky at all.<br>All in all it was an average experience and I don't think I would voluntarily choose VN in the future."
153,Joachim J,1,"Completely useless airline. Take you  money when you book an ticket. Give you confirmation of booking, and when you show up they don't have you in their system so you have to buy a new ticket. <br>Would never fly with this rotten and airline ever again."
153,tracy h,5,"Am just back from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, flying to Hanoi and then using Vietnam Airlines for 3 internal flights before using them again to fly home to London. There is a surprising amount of legroom on the international flights, my husband is 6'5"" tall but the space was adequate. On the way out, the plane was half empty so we were encouraged to move to empty seats which gave even more room. The flight on the way back was full so did feel a bit more cramped. The food was pleasant enough and plentiful on the long haul flights. On the internal ones, you are given a refreshing towel on take off and a complimentary drink of water or coke which I thought was a nice touch. No attempt to get you to buy food and drink at an extortionate cost as would be the case on UK internal flights. The stewards were all beautifully turned out and very welcoming. Would certainly use this airline again."
154,KLinh,2,"The Lotus lounge is good. Good selection of food &amp; drink.<br>The service: was good, Mai the crew person that looked after us is nice and professional and presented VNAirlines well.<br>It is comfortable as expected. Everything is perfect from that end.<br>The crew: My seat is 2nd from the service bay and man oh man, the crew was so noisy speaking vietnamese loudly, arguing about something. It is so so unprofessional and people are paying for the comfort and able to relax during the flight and not to have to listen to noisy talk. It last at least 15 mins until the meals were served.<br><br>The drink: good cocktail, nice champagne.<br><br>The food: not so good. The roast duck is so dry that I couldn't eat so they gave me the noodle. It is so so salty. For a business class food, I expect better quality but I had better food in Economy class with Cathay or Singapore airlines.<br><br>Luggages: When I checked in, I saw they put the ""priority"" ticket on my luggage, but my luggages arrived almost last so I nearly missed my bus to the station to catch the TGV. This is business class, I expected a bit more service on that end, lucky I didn't miss my bus otherwise I will miss my train as well.<br>I had the similar experience with my luggage from Sydney to HoChiMinh city but the vietnamese staff was more helpful than the french staff who told me to wait."
154,Steven S,4,Traveled from Melbourne to Da nang return both International and Domestic and found airline comfortable and efficient. All flights were on time and food and service were good. Plenty of on board entertainment. Transfer from International to Domestic was easy and assisted by airline staff.
154,Erics0n,2,"I flew Vietnemese airlines via Hanoi earlier this year. First of all, all four flights were delayed from 1 to 4 hours. The worst one was the one from Hanoi to London, where no communication was given of when the flight would resume, and it just dissappeared from the TV screen. Reason given was a technical fault and after a nervious 4 hour wait they let us on the plane. <br><br>Baggage arrived to London completely soaked. We saw this rain in Hanoi and I believe it was as a result of the delay. They just left our baggage out in the rain. <br><br>On the way back i asked the baggage to be taken out at Hanoi, and when arriving, the baggage was lost. After a very very nervious wait, 12 hours later they found the baggage at the airport. <br><br>The complaints department are useless and nobody to talk to anywhere. I would not fly or recommend them. The only reason I gave them a 2 star is the service when flying in the plane was ok. But all the issues around baggage and the lack of care when I complained will certainly stop be from ever flying them again."
154,30Asha,4,I travelled from Singapore to Ho chi Minh in Vietnam airlines. It is such a pleasure to see the lovely smiling faces of the crew wearing their traditional outfit in beautiful colour. The service is very good. Food is excellent. But if you are a vegetarian inform while booking your ticket. The airlines is good with timing. My experience was very good and I will definitely take the flight in future too.
154,hideh0,5,"this was only a short flight, the whole experience was fine, the staff were attentive and friendly. Great for a short flight."
156,camuche123,1,"Very old A321 with a major issue on cabin temperature as it was above 28 degree and everyone was complaining. No reactivity from the pilot, the crew gave us additional water. My seat 22a was broken with the back of the seat always going backward!"
156,pslovetravel,3,"The flight depart to Hanoi, I do not have a good review on it. Service from crews.. not  nice. They keep speak in Vietnamese (Maybe we look like Vietnamese and the whole flight 90% is Vietnamese) and we do not understand what they say. we speak in English to them, they will reply you in simple english like ok. no. yes. For me, I feel they are not very friendly to us, not even smile.  <br>About the food, because we have 1 member is vegetarian, we asked if they any extra vegetarian meals for us. their respond is. ""no. we need request before on flight"". and attitude like unhappy with our question. Of course, we know from website, we need to request before 24h. This is the first time with Vietnam Airway, there are no direct link for us to write or request special meals during book the flight ticket. It only write there, you need request. from where? at which link? no information at all. Also our false, we forgot about this after book. Thus, we only try our luck if possible they have extra vege meals on flight.<br>Anyway, we manage to find and request the Vegetarian meals during return flight. The solution is.. messege them from FB messenger. this part, I give them perfect service as my review. FB messenger response fast and send us updated itinerary once request done.<br>For the return flight from Hanoi to SG. The crews is more nice and friendly. They provide friendly and helpful service. Just to highlight, this flight, 80% are foreigner on flight. I just wondering, because not so many local-Vietnamiese, then they will give better service? Crews in my return flights speak well in English.<br>In summary, I have bad reviews on their flight to Hanoi but good review on their flight return to SG."
156,Carolyn G,4,"Very short flight so no snack service offered but did get a cold drink and refresher towel.  Because we are tall westeners, we were offered the emergency exit row on check-in, which was nice.  Service is reliable, affordable and on time, can't ask for much more."
156,callard113,4,This was a great flight from start to finish.  Business class food and service was better than I had expected.  Many other airlines could learn from Vietnam Airlines particularly when it comes to service.  Well done and thank you.
156,Zoe Le,5,"Fantastic as always, out of the 5 times I have been to Vietnam, I flew with VA 4 times. Staff are always very friendly, food is average plane food, entertainment is great. Although this is more on the expensive side, I would still recommend flying with them."
157,suzideane,3,"I have travelled on this airline in the past and at that time they were very good. Unfortunately our recent trip was disappointing. They have really dropped the ball, not one of our internal flights was on time, 45 min delays every time. We upgraded to premium economy and found out it wasn’t any different to economy, slightly bigger seats, but everything else was the same as back further. Our in flight entertainment wasn’t working properly. Needs to improve."
157,McReed01,5,It was our first time flying with Vietnam Airlines and it was great.  We flew Economy on an Airbus A321 that was comfortable and with the most legroom of any plane that we have flown on in years.  The flight crew were very friendly and there was no charge for a checked bag.
157,ozirosy,4,"Airline staff very accommodating , seating comfortable and so was choice of movies availability. The only minus was the fact that when directions were given on speakerphone in English,  it was not understandable."
157,Eriskay51,3,"Travel agent suggested we use this airline to Vietnam. They do not allow you book in online from Melbourne as a result we had to wait in line for well over an hour which was ridiculous. Left  on time but rather chaotic boarding. Usually you get called by rows in an orderly fashion, but in this instance everyone just stampeded to the boarding gate. The food was decidedly mediocre. The drinks eg wine was served in a tiny glass whoosh and it was gone.. The staff were not pleasant at all, they gave the impression of being bored and disinterested. They need to brush up on their social skills. In flight entertainment was very limited, and my set did not work so had to move to another seat. Got us there of course but would not use them again."
157,Wendy M,4,We travelled as family of 9 in premioum economy   Staff were attanetive and friendly   Food was good   Cabin was very comfortable  Only issue we had was the lack of choices of movies   Would travel with them again<br>Only issue we had was travelling via Hoi Chiu Minh to Danang hard to get help at airport changing from international to domestic  Long walk with little signage    Late arriving so very stressed
158,Lyne S,2,"Had very uncomfortable flight in Premium Economy. When the seats in front of you were inclined there wasn't any room to get out of your seat if you were near the window.<br>I had to ask the person in front to sit up any time I needed to use the bathroom. It was the same for the person behind me. Im not a big person and it was still difficult  The foot rest was broken on both the flights ( to and from Vietnam) so my legs were left dangling with the seat cutting across my calf. On The return flight the in flight entertainment was not working on both my husband""s and mine. My son and his partner also flew Premium Economy on different days and had similar issues.  The staff were very pleasant and tried to help but nothing they could do to rectify the discomfort. Never again !!"
158,tranadao,2,"I have been flying with Vietnam Airlines as my airline of choice between Singapore and Vietnam for many years. My last experience was a bit of a chock. The airline completely cut the free 1 checked bag allowance for Economy class without clear announcement, which for a non-budget airline image is ridiculous. We only found out when arrived at check-in counter with 2 kids and NO checked bag was allowed! In the end we had to pay around SGD 83 for 1 checked bag (23kg)! This is a big minus and one of the differentiation with the competing airlines which I will now frequent as their prices are generally much lower."
158,KiranJ1303,3,"Was a plesant experience from smooth check in until the flight departed. However once in the air, the joy was short lived when the passenger behind me shoved his leg on the armrest between my seat n that of my neighbour. Pressed the assistance button but because the stewards had just started serving drinks on the 1h flight and I was sitting at the back, they only reached me 40 mins later.  They did tell the guy behind me to take his foot off but by then we were nearly arriving to the aiport. So if you travelling Vietnam airlines, beware of people feet appearing."
158,Santi S,4,"Very comfortable , the seat is separtate . Nice food , good service.fly look like silk . Very nice smile"
158,Steve G,4,Good service and food. The seats were comfortable much better than economy but of course not as good as......You pay for what you get. We were happy the seating given we paid for our family holiday with four adults travelling together. When my wife and I go alone next time -Business class!
159,Poul C,1,"I have been flying with Vietnam Airlines as my airline of choice between Malaysia and Vietnam for many years.<br>My last experience was a bit of a chock.  The airline has introduced a 1 bag luggage policy only and not the normal 2 bag and 40kg allowance, which for a premium business class ticket is ridiculous.<br>They have also stopped serving wine with the snack meal, another big minus and one of the differentiation with the competing airlines which I will now frequent as their prices are generally much lower."
159,Anthony,5,"I flew premium economy from BRU to SGN on a combined rail-flight operated by Air France and Vietnam Airlines. I checked in in BRU with my luggage which were marked with a yellow priority tag  and took a first class TGV train to CDG. At CDG, premium economy gave me access to priority security lane which was considerably shorter than the regular line. From CDG it was a non-stop flight on premium economy class. Overall, I had a very positive experience. The service was good, seating was comfortable, and the one way price was fair, regular economy was $600 vs $800 for premium economy."
159,John B,3,"The flight was good, movies were up to date and the plane arrived nearly on time even though it left an hour late, however the cabin service left much to be desired. The crew were not that friendly and made any request seem like a burden."
159,Lim Fun,5,This was my second time travel with Vietnam airline to Japan. Transit at Vietnam and you can stop by to try on Vietnam food while wait for boarding.<br>Comfortable seats and delicious food &amp; drinks served. There are wines (red/white) and Viet coffee served. Don't miss the Viet coffee if you are coffee lover.<br>Not to forget fare price offered with excellent service.
159,Grant L,4,Comfortable flight with good service from cabin crew. Cabin crew very attentive and polite with good english.
160,GoldenPiggies,3,"I had flown with Vietnam Air 7-8 years ago on economy class once and the Vietnamese flight attendants were all unpleasant with rigid facial expression with no smile and don’t talk to me kinda body expression which clearly showed I don’t like my job. After that experience, I stopped flying with Vietnam airline.<br><br>It has been many years so I was hoping their service standard has improved when I booked business class for my family on the same route.<br>Oh my god, it was worse than my last experience with a senior flight attendant. She had her back turn touching something n not interested greeting n looking at us even though we said “hello” upon entering aircraft.. The whole duration of the flight, she walked around with no smile, no eye contact with angry face.<br>I wonder how she could set a good example to her juniors on that plane or any other plane.<br>Also, saw an old passenger struggle with English language but there was nobody could speak Korean to help him in the business class even though it was Icn-Hanoi in the business class and 90% passengers were Korean. Poor grandpa...<br><br>Though other junior flight attendant did perform professionally with smile, polite body language and tried to make eye contact if passengers needed something.<br>He saved our flight experience from 0 star to 3 stars!<br><br>I like Vietnam Airlines airplanes as they are newer model n seats are more comfortable than some other East Asian airlines but it loses one star for lack of service training and not having a crew in the business class who can converse in Korean when it’s arriving or departing Korea with mostly Korean passengers.<br><br>I have another trip to Hanoi with my family in Nov but I’m trying to see if I can fly with other Asian airlines with better service.."
160,Wendy M,5,"We flew from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh and then transferred across to dosmestic to fly onto Hanoi. Vietnam Airlines all the way. Highly recommend them as an airline. All went smoothly, everything was on time, meals excellent, staff very courteous and professional. Pleased on our return flight back to Melbourne too!"
160,dlm24813,5,"My wife and I were excited to find out we were upgraded to premium economy for our recent flight to Ho Chi Minh. We applied prior to the flight for the upgrade on a deal with uptown and couldn’t be confirmed until check in but and when we did check in we were so excited.<br>The seats were comfortable, service excellent, food was enjoyable and the beer and wine were really nice except not being icy cold and priority check in.<br>If your contemplating booking premium economy just do it because it is worth every cent."
160,tracysT9207SJ,4,The service on our flight was outstanding!<br>The food and entertainment was great. The staff were very professional. The plane wasn't as squishy as some of the others are.<br>Thankyou
160,John. NZ,4,"Much better flight than I expected. Good leg room, food was nice, cabin service very good, on time, however, in flight entertainment could be better with most of the content aimed at the Asian traveller. I made use of the Optiontown website and got empty seats next to me both ways giving plenty of room. An enjoyable flight that I would be happy to do again."
161,Margaret D,5,Superb flight.<br>Ground + cabin staff second to none!<br>Great choice of food and very good choice.<br>Highly recommend.
161,joanreeves234,5,An overnight flight made extra comfortable as i was allocated 3 seats in a row so i could stretch out and sleep.<br><br>Staff were helpful and courteous.
161,Russell M,4,"On the new Boeing Dreamliner. Very quiet and comfortable. In flight service was good.<br>If using to get to Sydney, recommend that have 1/2 nights in Ho Chi Minh (Saigon) as lay over is almost 16 hours. Fascinating city, great people and good restaurants <br><br>Price of flight is great value"
161,tezza181,4,"My recent direct flights to Hanoi and later onto Siem Reap were pleasant and comfortable. Plenty of leg room in economy; efficient, pleasant service and more-than-adequate food. No complaints about a very decent airline. Highly recommended."
161,Wanderer,3,I was travel alone from KL to Fukuoka and transit in Hanoi. The flight from Hanoi supposed to take off at 11pm but delay 2:30 am. Halal meal option quite delicious .
162,Leonora R,5,"Travelled with this airline two years ago and wouldn’t have given a good review but travelled this year and what a difference.  Friendly staff, very attentive.  Couldn’t fault the flight at all, excellent"
162,PDIlkley,4,"I was very impressed by this airline, the flight was very smooth &amp; service was excellent, although the food was better outgoing than on the return."
162,Sjd44,1,"I decided to take a stopover in Hanoi on the way to Paris. It was well worth it. The flights were comfortable, there was a good selection of food, movies etc. Watch out for long layovers in Vietnam on the return journey. Also any changes to travel dates are exorbitant, $850 to get an earlier flight!"
162,Shami,5,"My wife and myself used this airline for our round trip Ho Chi Minh-Hanoi and were very impressed with their service. The flights were on time, served very nice meals, on board wife was superb and we could watch movies on our mobile phone. I also like to see where I would be when flying and the flight tracker is always a PLUS for me. I also found the fares reasonable for the quality of serve they offer. USD214 for return flights for two people sound good to me.<br><br>I will definitely fly Vietnam Airlines the next time I travel to Vietnam."
162,michellemd2015,5,Took many internal flights as well and the staff were beyond efficient. Boarding and drink service ran quickly and with no delays.<br>One of the best airlines.
163,Karen P,4,As far as long haul flights go this was as good as expected. The food was standard plane food. The in flight entertainment was good with up to date films. The service was ok with mainly friendly staff. This is not an expensive airline so you get what you pay for and I would use them again.
163,Paul K,2,"There are not many options in Vietnam however if you are looking for a cheap fare pick anyone else, this company does nothing in relation to food and offer warm flat cola or water only. The only reason the get 2 is because we took of landed although that was also a bit rough. We also paid for extra leg room and were moved on two more flights from the seats we paid for!!"
163,scoot2018,3,"Overall- nothing special stood out. They wrap EVERYTHING in plastic. They need to curb their use of plastic from Wrapping the blankets to the cutlery. They ran out of the red meat option for meals and only had fish remaining- it was inedible!, and with a sleeping passenger next to me- each time the food service came they asked me to wake her- in the end I told them no- she is asleep. Im not their alarm clock."
163,LondonBrian,5,"Was bumped from our original flight on to a later one was annoyed when first informed of this but you have to take it in your stride and adjust accordingly to be fair we were given plenty of notice of this.<br>Check in at Siem Reap all the place seemed quire chaotic it went smoothly, no issues around baggage or cabin baggage , boarding was smooth and the plane was clean and comfortable which is all we wanted for a flight of about 1 hour.<br>After hearing some horror stories we were surprised at how good good the flight was"
163,Derek Swords,2,"I use this airline because they are the only one to fly direct from the UK to Vietnam. Given the choice, I would try any airline that is able to get a slot from London/Vietnam. Reason, cabin staff. They're so stuck up themselves, the impression I get is that they do this work as a favour to their paying guests. Observations. Cabin staff are not happy in front of their paying guests, yet they are clearly happy and friendly amount themselves.  A male cabin staff member walked the length of the plane calling 'want tea', no eye contact. There is clearly no connection between staff and passengers.<br>I travel to Vietnam twice per year, in all classes. In business and premium economy staff are friendly, economy less so. My advice, look to other airlines, see how they treat ALL their guests and make changes before your customers vote with their feet."
164,Tom Trung Lam,4,"Not a five star service, not departed from a busy connection Hub with heaps of high-class services, but if someone is after an affordable fare with a ""full service"" air carrier connecting Hanoi and Tokyo, then Vietnam airlines should be a considerable option. <br><br>Heading to the airport 3hours before departure time at 8AM when the streets of Hanoi were still asleep, it was a peaceful feeling.<br> <br>Checking queue was full of passengers bouncing for Tokyo, but it did not take too long as the airport was not in peak-hour. And The flight was allowed to leave on time as scheduled (early morning is always easy and relax in the most airports) so everyone could  then stay relaxed. It was a great start for the journey as on my opinion. <br><br>If you're a fan of commercial aircrafts, you would enjoy how the wide-body A350 lift you off the ground and climb up the clouds without shaking up your body. <br>In flight entertainment was not so interesting for time killing (I'm sick of watching movies and TV shows, especially on the 10"" screen), and catering was as same as other 4 star ranking airlines (generally, economy class meals does not satisfy passengers). <br><br>For those who are afraid of day time flight, the route seems to be smooth and nice in the beginning of October. The flight could make me enjoy the sight of sun drop through the clouds and the sleep for whole trip without disturbing by turbulence.  <br> <br>Landing on the ground of Haneda airport after 5hours flight, it was in early evening, and time to explore Tokyo night started. <br><br>Everything was good, but services need some improve, especially the way air hostesses serve passengers. We do expect a ""smile"" from you Vietnam Airlines."
164,JoCoMelbourne,4,We used Vietnam Airlines for flights to and from Melbourne and four internal flights. They all ran on time with the exception of one domestic that was about half an hour late. They were comfortable and the staff were friendly and efficient. The only issue I had was booking seats. We decided to pay $50 usd for extra leg room seats on the night flight return flight to Melbourne. Went went to the Vietnam Airlines ticket office in Hanoi to arrange the booking. Communicating our preferences was a struggle but we were eventually successful. When we checked in at Ho Chi Minh I was informed that we had reserved exit row seats and because we were over 65 we may have to move from these seats and be given a refund. I informed the check in lady that I had requested extra leg room seats and the fact that I was placed in exit row seats by Vietnam Airline staff was not my responsibility. As it transpired nothing was said on the plane. I did notice that two seats were vacant in the middle row that has extra leg room and a passenger from the row behind quickly moved into one of the vacant seats thus saving $50 usd. A smart move on his part. We thought the seats were worth the money although the engine noise seemed louder in this section of the plane. The movie choice was good and the food ok. Would fly with them again.
164,Fong Yee N,5,This is the first time taking flight under Vietnam Airlines. I like the space of the seat and meal served. Services given is excellent from counter till cabin crew. They really attentive to customer enquiries. I will be back if there is any chances to take Vietnam Airlines again.
164,Noddy52,5,"Took a business class trip from Phnom Penh to Sydney. The airline has just adjusted their baggage policy and was allowed 64kg plus a set of golf clubs included in ticket.  The 2 flights were very good, on time and the service was excellent.  Ha a stop over in Hochiminh and the use of the lounge was great, especially being able to use the shower before the long flight.<br>Also economy now allows 46 kg luggage on international flights, plus a set of golf clubs.  Their ticket prices are very competitive."
164,wombatwood,4,"Comfortable seats, good connection timing for travel to Europe and a very reasonable price of $4,200AUD return in business class.<br>FA’s friendly and always available if you needed something.<br>Only concern for me was during the 4 main meal servings, over the SYD-HAN, HAN - FRA I was given the wrong meal everytime 🤷🏼‍♂️, my got wrong meals x2 and the guy in the opposite had same issues. The FA’s actually come around, go through the menu and right down what you’ve ordered. On my last leg I was asked 3 times what I wanted to drink with my breakfast, I went for orange juice and got tea ☕️ <br>I wouldn’t hesitate to fly VN again but they do need to sort this stuff out."
165,Michael H,4,"It was not a very long flight, so it's acceptable seating and comfort. They serve tiny Vietnamese  sandwich and water that was very nice of the airlines. Air Canada don't even serve you a glass of water let alone sandwich. Overall it was a good experience, fast check-in"
165,P Loft,5,"I flew from Da Nang to Hanoi on a Vietnam Airlines, (after being delayed for unknown/unexpected reasons on Jetstar Pacific). It has been my experience on my many trips to Vietnam, that Vietnam Airlines has the best “on time” performance on domestic routes. <br><br>We boarded a few minutes later than the scheduled boarding time, due to a gate change, but we departed on time. The gate team greeted and handled passengers efficiently, politely and professionally.<br><br>We were greeted by smiling professionals well groomed flight attendants, who assisted many passengers with bags and seating. My exit row seat was clean, and comfortable, and the flight attendant offered me a new blanket (something of a rarity on US Flights these days.<br><br>We arrived in hanoi on time. What more could a passenger ask for?"
165,andyhum,4,"Comfortable flight and fast checkin, in flight entertainment was limited and the food was average. Staff were very efficient and friendly."
165,soniaberton,3,"Friendly staff and food is better than many other airlines. 30kg for luggage is also better than other airlines.<br><br>The leg room for overseas flights,is for some reason, far tighter than domestic services. If you are over 5 feet tall it would be an impossible oveseas flight to take. Domestic flights are generally delayed. Lastly I was offered a $300 cash back for using vietnam airlines and a month later still waiting for this......"
165,Fabrizio B,4,"I and my wife flew Vietnam Airlines between Hanoi and Phu Quoc last August. We had been assigned awful seats at the back of the aircraft.<br>Before taking off, we were offered two seats just behind the business class section.<br>We had a much more agreeable flight.<br>Thank you !!"
166,Moimak,5,"Stereotypes guide us, so I was in disaster mode for the Bangkok-Hanoi return flight.But Vietnam Airlines was a pleasant surprise.On time, good legroom,polite staff and reasonable food.Best of all, flying from Suvarnabhumi, saving you the dubious pleasure of a Don Muang trek.Slightly more expensive than the budget airlines but well worth it."
166,Mer_Simz,2,"Our flight scheduled for 17.00, and when we check in at 15.00 we were informed that our flight had been canceled (not delayed but canceled). The Airline didn't informed us beforehand and when we complain, they just trying to find us seat in the next flight at 19.00 ( trying, not guaranteed). Luckily we got the flight and they give us dinner voucher as a compensation. The flight ok, but the seat cover were dirty, we're wearing our hoody jacket to protect our hair. No food served just a cup of water in flight."
166,Shannon K,1,We had booked and paid for the exit row seats months in advance and at check in our seats had been moved and were not the ones we had booked or paid for.<br><br>A warm flat cola or water was the only drink option<br><br>Air hostess had no control over guests where kids where not stapped in for landing and take off and people standing up and getting bags down when seat belt sign on.<br><br>I will never fly this airline again.!
166,Annick VH,2,"We had 3 flights with Vietnam Airlines (Hanoi - Siem Reap, Siem Reap - Ho Chi Minh City and HCM to Hue). The flights were ok but the staff isn't friendly at all. Not when checking-inn and not on the airplanes. We had 2 friendly stewards but all the rest was not friendly. It has to be standard..."
166,Andre E,1,"On a recent business class trip to Saigon , I requested an upgrade via Option town which is a subsidiary company working in conjunction with Vietnam airlines and numerous airlines for upgrades etc . I was  sent a link via my work place to upgrade at a particular cost ( USD $600 ). Option town disregarded the discounted quote and charged me more than four times the amount , I was charged over  $4400 . I didn’t get upgraded on my first leg or the next and  received an email later, informing me of my upgrade from Saigon to Siam Reap in Cambodia was successful , but I had all ready travelled in economy . Even though I checked with a Vietnam airlines representative in Saigon and informed them of my pending upgrade . They charged  me and I am still yet , to resolve the matter . They still haven’t refunded the funds and all I have to show for it , is a number of emails saying they will investigate . Very dubious web site , which is quick to take your money with out giving you..... Options !!  Avoid like the plague"
167,Trish R,2,"This was the first time we have flew with this carrier internationally, we have travelled with the them  internally through Vietnam. Our flight from Sydney was over four hours late due to mechanical problems. One can accept that but the fact that they left passenger standing in a line waiting to board for well over 1/2 hr before word came through that it was delayed. No announcements were made that any of us heard. No help from staff at boarding gates and not able to contact Vietnam airlines until Monday (it was Saturday flight). No compensation was offered to us. We missed our connecting flight as well as pickups from arrival airport to hotel and had to pay for transport. The food on the flight was terrible most people appeared not to eat it. Cabin staff were not overly helpful their English appeared to be very limited so communication was hard. Whilst after complaining to airline while on our holiday they did upgrade us on our return flight which was great but unfortunately food was still poor and staff again did not appear to understand Oh and yet again flights ran late. This was our third trip to Vietnam and really like to support the airline but need major improvements in staff communication and food. It never hurts to smile and say hello Vietnam airlines  and keep people informed of what is happening you would be surprised how understanding most of us can be."
167,Paul M,3,"I was quite impressed with Vietnam Airlines from a low expectation level, except the one thing that really peed me off which was, out of 4 flights we only sat in our chosen seats once, not to bad as we were replaced with equivilant positions on 3 flights, except for the return flight where we did not get the window seat - really really annoying, no sleep and disturbed multiple times. But, what are the real alternatives - JetStar, who you can't trust not to cancel a flight (happened to me on a previous Hawaii flight, stating safety concerns 2 weeks from the flight - utter BS, so I haven't used them since) or Vietnam Airlines  who aren't quite there on customer service yet? Probably Vietnam with a bit more checking at check-in"
167,BJWK,5,"having terrible experience with jetstar, tried vietnam airline.  good choice.  paid more and got better treatment in return.  worth the extra money to not have your day ruined.  <br><br>fairly new plane.  good in-flight service.  friendly/helpful ticket counter staff who was not trained to nitpick to charge you extra here and there.  priority take-off/landing (in vietnam) hence less waiting.  overall, pleasant experience."
167,onewend,5,lovely staff and cabin crew. Great newish Airbus. The humidified air wafting through the vents as we got on was a bit of a surprise but smell told me it was not the plane on fire and my sinuses appreciated the effort<br>Vietnam Airline groundstaff at Nha trang on my way home were hugely helpful when Jetstar pacific turned out not to have me booked on a flight which didn't exist anyway and their stand person was not helpful. I booked with them and they got me to Hanoi where jetstar would have left me standing in the airport  without a backward glance
167,SueS_H2014,4,"I booked 3 tickets from London to Hanoi through travel trolley, I was stressed because my flight number was  not recognised until 24hrs before the flight I called the airline e to check k my flight was actually real! <br>Check in was smooth, we had 3 middle seats together fairly comfortable. The staff can.e round often with food and drinks I was unable to get a vegetarian  meal for neither dinner or breakfast so ended up with 4 small rolls, family sandals were ok. Entertainment was good had music &amp; films"
168,I3ruceky,2,"Originally booked tickets through expedia to find that they changed their baggage rules on 1 August. On their website it says: ""Passengers who have already purchased tickets before the effective date of the new rule are still eligible for the standard baggage allowance as of their existing tickets.""<br><br>We check in at the airport to be told 'no luggage'. So we have to pay. Must pay cash, no credit card. Also told to book luggage online for the return trip. <br>Tried to then waste more time and money online for the return trip, the option isn't there and then advised that because we bought through agent we had to either go to the airport 6 hours before flight or go to their office to pay. <br><br>Paying money isn't the issue but not once did the airline try to even entertain the fact that luggage should be already included even though they acknowledged being paid for in May. Wasted time running around for a short weekend getaway simply because they couldn't even organise or a payment to be taken. <br><br>Also tried to say our carry on luggage was too big. It's a standard samsonite bag sold for carry on which we have travellend on multiple airlines without issues. It also fits comfortably in their measuring tool for hand luggage. Are the staff on commission when they upsell excess luggage?<br><br>We have done the same trip with another airline and it was like chalk and cheese. They were brilliant and probably around the same price. This was sub par and a joke. Another party that we met flew in on Vietnam Airlines from another location and had a terrible experience the whole way too."
168,Mike N,5,"As usual, the flight itself was beaut - meticulously on time and skilled pilots that land their planes so well. Touching down doesn’t go far enough to describe a landing. <br>As usual the cabin service was exceptional. <br>As usual the planes were clean and modern. <br>This was the first time we’ve flown long haul in economy with Vietnam Airlines (we’ve flown business with them in the past). And we were pleasantly surprised with seating and how well we managed to sleep during the flight. <br>VA are most definitely worth looking at for anyone travelling on routes they service."
168,2014annon,5,"I was actually very pleasantly surprised.  Amazing Service, with pillows, blankets, meals, drinks, bottled water, slippers and a toothbrush.  Free Movies also, and the seats were really good.  I was told previously that this Airline has ""small seats, designed for Small Vietnamese people""  totally untrue.  I could not fault them at all, the air stewards were all lovely and spoke very good English.  The first class and Business seats looked Amazing also.  FANTASTIC"
168,Martin B,4,"Legroom was good and by using the ""Option town"" service we secured and empty seat between us. Food was OK but nothing to rave about. A dud tv screen going over couldn't be rectified so that wasn't good. Why does the drinks cart come out after the meals cart? Fine if you want a wine but no so if you want a drink before your meal. On the flight home I couldn't even get a coffee because they said the turbulence was too bad.... not that I noticed. Air crew were pleasant but soon disappeared."
168,Ervina,3,"I originally booked VN 610, depart BKK on 21 May at 11:55am to arrive HAN at 13:55pm.  On 13 May, VN informed of the flight cancellation and rescheduled it to VN 614, depart BKK same day but at 15:55pm, arrive HAN at 17:55pm.  <br><br>While there are no major impact to my travel plan as that was for leisure, this cancellation however caused inconvenience and loss of time, I could have 4 hours more in Hanoi to enjoy my lunch, instead of arriving late in the evening and I had to reschedule my airport pickup.  No compensation of course since the notification came much in advance.  <br><br>On another trip on Aug 7, at Siem Reap airport, I noted the only VN flight to Luang Prabang non-stop was cancelled.  On a separate occasion, my boss' flight from FRA-SIN via SGN/HAN was cancelled 2 weeks in advance.  <br><br>Overall, VN price is attractive, service is good &amp; mostly reliable for standard routes, eg SIN-SGN-SIN.  But flight cancellation by airline is something you have to be prepared for.  <br><br>For subsequent flights SIN-HAN/SGN, I will only fly SQ, and for domestic within VN, I've booked Vietjet.  It seems VJ arrived on time, and I will review it after my trip in November, from Hai Phong (HPH) to BKK.  Stay tuned!"
169,Nemanja Lazic,5,"Lovely, friendly and professional staff. Definitely enjoyed from the moment I step to the aircraft, till the moment I went out. <br>Amazing food on flight, dinner was delicious, as well breakfast. <br>My flight attendant was Lan Anh, which was very polite but at the same hand friendly. <br><br>Bed was comfortable, options of the movies was poor (thats the only - from me)  <br>Can’t wait to fly again with you. Reach Further!"
169,Jules20056,4,We flew return Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh.  Legroom on both flights was generous for economy class and certainly better than some other international carriers.  Seat width was just average.  Service on the first flight was better than on the second flight where service was minimal.  On the return leg they had run out of one evening meal option long before they got to our row - given we had not been provided with a menu on that leg we had no idea what the options were in any case.  There was quite a bit of turbulence on the return leg so i wonder if this was the reason for the reduced service.<br><br>Check in lines were long and moved slowly.<br><br>Tip:  we got an email from Optiontown offering us an additional seat (if available) for $15 per person (there were 2 of us) one way.  We were lucky and got the extra seat on both legs making the flight a lot more comfortable having the empty seat between us.  If you get the option then take it.  Lots more comfort for minimal cost.
169,Nevis Sampson,4,"was very assisting with all passengers, helping to your seat, very friendly, wanting to please.<br>loved the cotton hand towel given before lunch or dinner and breakfast.<br>food was lovely and plentiful and good wine."
169,Daniel19721972,1,"The airplane was stinking as never cleaned toilet.<br>And when we arrived near danang, about 3 meters from the ground, they reactivated the engines, as they forgot to get out the wheels<br>incredible"
169,MichiganderAbroad,5,"For about $100, you can't beat a business class fare on Vietnam Airlines if you have inter-country flights. I was able to check in my bag in about 3 minutes (in comparison to the long line for economy passengers) and head to the Lotus lounge while I waited for my flight to be called. The plane was spotlessly clean, the staff were friendly, and the flight arrived on time though it left about 15 minutes late. No complaints here."
170,DevonBlueboy,3,"On the long haul legs their B787 Dreamliners are very comfortable.  The service is good, in parts.  Just before landing in HAN a member of the flight crew was behind the curtain decanting some red wine from its original bottle into a plastic bottle.  I smiled and suggested it would taste much nicer in glass.  He was not amused!<br><br>Traveling in Business was great; they board you separately with your own bus to take you to the plane; the same on landing.  On all the internal flights too.<br><br>On the overnight leg from SGN to LHR it was a shame that the cabin crew kept walking around opening and banging closed cupboard doors when you're trying to sleep!.<br><br>And if you do sign up for their Mileage programme, be very careful to check thet you are credited with the miles.  Their systems are a bit clunky."
170,Isamubb,1,We pre booked seats on line from Ho Chi Min to Seoul which was for free according to their website and I have an email confirmation for it  but when we checked in the counter on the day we departed the lady changed our seats without telling us. When I checked my emails I found out they have charged us for the seats. I have been contacting  Vietnam Airlines and my emails are being passed on from one customer  service person to another and each of them are trying to pretend that they don’t understand what I’m trying to say even though I have provided them with proofs of receipts and a copy of our boarding pass ... needless to say VIETNAM AIRLINES is trying to avoid to refund us for the  un-authorised charges on my credit card! Would never recommend to deal with this airline at all.
170,Frank A,4,Second trip to Vietnam with this Airline and found them to provide a great service at every level.<br>Also used them during internal flights and can’t fault them .<br>I also found the meals with this Airline to be some of the best in flight meals Ive ever tasted.
170,Jennie,1,"I broke into tears after 4 delays, 2 days 1 night endless waiting, 3 times check-in, check-out, going through customs and the flight was finally canceled. No official apology from the airlines representative, no compensation. One of the worst experiences in my life and the biggest regrets choosing this airlines! No competion, negative monopoly, no respect to customers."
170,W1lsie,3,Our flight was cancelled however they made us spend hours checking in and then hours at the airport before they informed us.<br>Very annoying to find out it’s because of engineering issues which makes me feel very nervous about our flight hopefully today and the other 5 internal flights we have coming up. The staff at Sydney airport were lovely and experts at this but the process was extremely slow and exhausting.
171,Rick P,3,"Had 5 domestic flights with them over the week, flights went pretty much without hitch, besides 2 being delayed about 20 min each.<br>Twice<br>The info board was completely wrong once, last night in HUI it said our plan had departed, and it hadn’t even loaded.  Another time it mislabeled the gate, in SgN.<br>Quirky rules, can’t go thru check in until 2 hrs before flight so you need to stay in lobby at HUI.<br>Some of the gate agents in HUI needs their attitudes adjusted, not customer friendly in the least. <br>Pro, they are part of sky team alliance."
171,JefftheNomad,4,"Had the economical price of a budget airline without the maddening nickel-and-diming.  Price was transparent and accurate.  While there was nothing particularly special about the cabin experience, it did include everything I vaguely expect: meals, drinks (even free wine!  rarity these days it seems at this price).  There were no hidden charges for baggage or other things and their system worked transparently with the reseller I happened to use.  I would fly with them again and recommend others to do the same over ""budget"" and non-transparent airlines like AirAsia."
171,VibrantAurora,3,"Our confirmed flight at 5pm was cancelled and the airline just sent us an email two days before to inform that we have been assigned to 6pm flight. Customer service hotline wasn’t picked up so we got the help of hotel reception to check if we could change to an earlier flight without penalty, as we have a prior appointment. We managed to change to a 3.45pm flight only to be told it had been delayed to 4.30pm upon check in. The flight took off about 5pm. We paid extra $ for front seats but that was nullified with the change of flights. Seats are spacious, only drinks are served for domestic flights which is understandable."
171,Cindy,4,"We had no problems at all with Vietnam Airlines. From check in to arrival, everything went smoothly. The seats and leg room were better than the airline we flew with previously. We received in flight meals, drinks and water. While the meals were not fantastic , they were well received and at least they were provided. Staff were helpful.<br>In flight entertainment again was ok. We had four flights with them and would definitely choose this airline again."
171,Andrew M,4,"It's nice to get an ""old school"" full service on a short haul flight and no questions about baggage - common sense prevails. Pleasant staff despite a full A321 - they had time for everybody. One minor criticism; at Hong Kong boarding was by bus with no AC until it was on the move. We were kept standing on the bus for 15 minutes whilst they sorted their paperwork. No apology."
172,Victor,1,Our flight ight got delayed over 2 hours.<br>Then we were told we would receive a complementary meal at the airport because of the delay. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no meal at all. There are plenty of other good airlines in Asia which has better service than this one.
172,0460robo,4,"Flights both ways arrived earlier than scheduled by 30 mins or so. The aircraft is comfortable. The business check in and security line is quick and efficient and well worth the extra, certainly in Hanoi where the economy check in looked very crowded and chaotic."
172,HamoodiLim,3,"Price of economy super lite not inclusive of checked in luggage from sin to Saigon which wasn't very clear. It took me awhile before I realised that a full cost carrier like VN has an updated baggage policy. In the midst of the confusion, I paid more for pre paid baggage when I could've just choose a higher tier - economy lite for much lesser. A350 had so many advertisements on the screen! Stop interrupting my shows already. During boarding crew played the safety video, clearly safety is not priority. Pax sitting in emergency exit had the seat reclined while plane was taxiing. Crew was in the crew seat facing them but failed to notice. Only noticed when plane was about to take off. No smiles. Call buttons were never attended to. They were left on throughout the flight. Would I fly VN again? Only if they are having a promotion. Else, it's Singapore airlines for me."
172,Peter L.,4,"We traveled to and from Australia plus 3 internal flights with Vietnam Airlines. We were very happy with the price, service, staff, food etc. looking forward to returning to Vietnam again and wouldn’t hesitate to fly with Vietnam Airlines."
172,Redoranges,4,Short domestic 45 minutes flight to and from Ho Chi Minh and Cam Ranh (for Nha Trang) <br><br>They serve soft beverages like water and soft drinks. No snacks or nuts provided. <br><br>The HCM to CAM sector was relatively empty and was given an emergency row seat.
173,BaThong,2,"We have booked our flight with selected seats in the rows 22’s. When checking in online, we realized that the airline has moved us all the way to the back, last row without possibility to recline the seat. Lucky that this is only 2 hours flight. Our flight on next day going to Da Lat, has been rescheduled to leave Saigon at 6am instead of 10am. That forced us to wake up and check out at 4am.<br>The return flight from Da Lat has been rescheduled to 9pm instead of 6pm. It was lucky that my flight to Singapore was the next day and not that same evening. The airline also messed up with preselected seats."
173,Brenda Prato,5,My husband and I were travelling around Vietnam for ouir honeymoon trip. We went down till Da Nang and caught Vietnam Airlines to go back to Hanoi.<br><br>Staff were very  nice with us and helpful. The aircraft was comfortable and they provided blankets &lt;3<br><br>We also had something nice to drink. The aircraft was pretty clean too.<br><br>Would love to come again!
173,timdalco,1,Horrible staff. Horrible service. Horrible food. Horrible website (can’t even change seats- how difficult is that when checking in online? Easy for every other company). Never flying with them again.
173,David T,4,Easy check in<br>Clean toilets<br>Plane clean.<br>Hassle Free trip.<br>Baggage collected quickly and undamaged.<br>Will fly again.
173,stickynote1,4,"We recently flew from Melbourne to Hanoi with Vietnam Airlines which the first part of our leg was on a A350 and the second part on a Dreamliner.<br>The flight between Melbourne and Ho Chi Minh City struck a large amount of turbulence but the service was good although they did run out of meal choices.<br>The staff were very pleasant but we did find that they didn’t come around after the meals were served and seem to stay in the galley.<br>The other criticism would be the seats seem to have a small base which makes it uncomfortable for long flights, yes I realise airlines are chasing space but maybe too much.<br>We would fly with this airline again but would like to see some small but important improvements"
174,Danny FortLaure,1,"Flying to Japan at 600$ per ticket and I need to take a bus to the plane with no airco, old plane no screens to watch a movie, bad service. I felt robbed from my money, it's not a low cost flight yet I was scammed by this company, great the vietjet are opening this route which will cost 200$. I will never fly with Vietnam Airlines again! And I advise you to do the same"
174,Gary R,3,Tried using the airline App to checking in for our return flights to the UK seats had already been alloctaed for the first leg of the journey but not for the second once the app finally worked after many attempts the seats for the second leg were automatically alloctaed with option to changed these we directly in front of the toilets asked checkin staff who wouldn't change them on boarding we found blankets bagged up behind the seats stopping them from reclining staff onboard wouldn't move them and top it all they ran out of one choise of breakfast. Would not recomend due to poor customer care. Avoid row 24 on 787 Dreamliner
174,happily-o,4,"I enjoyed it a lot since I haven't been on a plane for quite a while, but I think they did a great job even when I don't speak any Vietnamese. The entertainment audio had just enough to cover the basic areas. They introduced many of the great sites in Vietnam, that I wish I knew earlier, and that I would wish to go back again. They served the food at the right timing too."
174,RowdyMelbourne,5,"Cant fault the friendly service from all the crew. Good choice of meals and always hot. Attentive and ready to clear up or get a top up for you. Amenities always kept clean and fresh during the flight,"
174,00000,1,"I am extremely frustrated, without notification the first leg of my flight was cancelled, and I was rebooked for a next day flight. I needed to arrive on the date booked. The flight was not cancelled due to weather nor was any explanation given. Even more frustrating no modification was made to the second leg of my flight. When trying to contact the available numbers I was first directed to the American number, which was not open, and then directed to the Japanese number because it was within 48 hours of my flight (the flight was cancelled less than 12 hours prior to departure), but then the Japanese number is not available until less than 2 hours before the flight. This is even more frustrating because this flight is already a rebooked flight after my previous itinerary had an airline change made that would not work with my schedule. <br>I do not plan on me EVER booking with Vietnam airlines again and I cannot see myself in good conscience recommending the airline to others. My entire experience has been that the airline is unreliable, will change flights without explanation or notification to the passengers, and has customer service that is unreachable or unable to provide assistance."
175,BristolMelly73,5,"Excellent service, comfy seats, lots of space, excellent food and service, plenty of great entertainment, thoroughly enjoyable long haul flight"
175,Thomas Ames,3,"I've been flying many years, an older traveler, so I've been on airplane flights for 65 years. The domestic flight from DaLat to Ho Chi Minh City and Returning as well, is unreliable in respect to meeting their flight times posted when purchasing tickets. I have flown VJet, domestically on this route but they also have a problem being on time. I decided to spend a bit more for a ticket and upgraded myself to Vietnam Airlines thinking that would solve the schedule problem, but it didn't. The last time I flew my flight was to depart Ho Chi Minh City at 1335 and arrive in DaLat about 45 minutes later, they cancelled the flight saying it was delayed and moved everyone on the 1335 flight to the next flight about 4 hours later. That plane had many available seats and put everyone behind schedule about 5 hours from the earlier flight. I am only alerting flyers about the scheduled flight between DaLat and Ho Chi Minh City. It's better, I think when buying your ticket ahead of time to allow about 6 hours delay time on any meetings or appointments, just in case there is a similar delay.  Everything was very good on the airplane, the attendants and pilots did everything they could to make our flight a good memory for all the passengers."
175,Robert H,5,"Excellent service, friendly staff throughout.  Inexpensive and usually on time.  I would definitely fly this airline again."
175,Melbguy3805,5,"When flying domestic, i always fly vietnam business class. Pretty cheap, bigger seats, priority bags, priority through security as well.<br>The meal was good.<br>Only downside was the flight left 20 min late."
175,Euan R,4,"Flew on Boeing 787-9 in Premium Economy, very comfortable for flight of almost 10 hours, Flight was a little late leaving but caught up a lot of the time. Service was very good and food selection toon was either European or Vietnamese, we tried both. A great way to go from Sydney to London or Europe, easy stopover or simple transfer in Hanoi. Very good trip"
176,jactyler,1,Three out of four flights severely delayed - Heathrow to Saigon plus domestic flights. Food awful and selection was really not good and that’s if you actually get a choice......The attitude of the cabin crew was dreadful on all the flights I took.  Generally I like to fly with the national carrier of the country I am visiting but never again would I fly with Vietnam Airways - they really could not care less about their passengers
176,Isaac Tan,1,"Warning to fellow passenger that travel on Vietnam Airline<br>Please be warned that the promotion tickets on Vietnam Airline are without luggage check in.<br>Although it is a full fledge airline, it is the only airline that promotion ticket without luggage check in.<br>It is in the small print and people will normally overlook it as people will thought it is a full fledge airline, luggage check in is included. <br>After you click on purchase on their website, there is no pop out window to state that you have no check in luggage.<br>And there is no way you can buy check in luggage after your purchase.<br>It happens to me. My wife and my two small kids were travelling from Singapore to Vietnam. <br>Only when we reach the airport and doing the check in, that they inform us there is no check in luggage.<br>Imagine, we are with two big size piece of luggage, they expect us to pay $9 per kilogram. That works out to be extra $360 over the ticket price. <br>For that price, I can take Singapore Airline. I argue with the check in customer service and was refer to the airport customer service manager. <br>There is not a single Vietnam Airline representative at the airport. This is irresponsible and unprofessional for an international airline.<br>As we need to take the plane, we unwilling and force to pay the check in luggage. Numerous travelers were also force to pay the luggage check in. <br>It will be my last and final time taking the Vietnam Airline, as the airline is totally unprofessional and irresponsible to it customer. <br>What they are doing is total unethical and cheating the traveler.  <br>Please help to share and reach out to more people. Thanks"
176,MikeLinda23,4,"Flew on the dreamliner, economy seats. To be fair, first things first, flights were on time and no problems, thats the main thing!! Food was reasonably good, drink choice good, movies choice not so good really- as a family of 4, we all struggled to find enough films to watch to fill the time happily."
176,Sydney243,4,"Good value for money flight direct to Hanoi. All seats have direct aisle access, food and entertainment was good. The seats are flat bed but not the most comfortable for sleeping. There is plenty of storage space and staff very helpful"
176,sunsetjive,4,Though the flight is a daily operational and routine flight on this sector i recommend that the in flight service has improved compared to past years. The online booking system too has improved making it a user friendly system. On the whole Vietnam Airlines has grown to provide a better service
177,michelle b,4,"the service was great coming in and returning home.<br>on the way back my husbands seat would not go back to sleep position and screen to watch movies etc was not working but they organised it as fast as they could by offering another seat in front of where we were sitting, but a young guy next to me said he would move so  hubby and I could stay together on the way home, which was really nice of him. so all good can't complain about anything really."
177,AnelazJb,3,"As a first-timer choosing this airline I did ask about the halal status of the food served as there is no label of halal at the packaging. Since the stewardess does not know I chose not to eat the meal and just eat bread and drinks. When returning from Nagoya to KUL with the same airlines then I noticed there is label halal as requested during booking. What a relief, I have double meals than as bought earlier at before boarding. Later then I only know that all airlines from Kuala Lumpur 's Airport are HALAL FOODS."
177,GaryNgan,4,It was a pleasant experience with Vietnam Airline to Nha Trang. The flight schedule is accurate and comfortable journey provides a very good experience to travellers. <br>There are couple of areas for improvement:<br>1) Flight transfer arrangement which traveller need to go to domestic terminal for flight transfer at HCM City. Looking forward for direct flight from HK to Nha Trang to be provided by Vietnam Airline in the future.<br>2) Traveller need to take the shuttle bus from boarding gate for boarding. It would be better if direct boarding from the boarding gate.
177,AdelasiaPL,5,Highly recommended! Good flight. Good service. Seats are enough comfortable. The cabin crews were excellent and care about you.
177,Goose on the Loose,4,"First time travelling business class so I'll start by stating I have nothing to compare to.<br><br>My experience was good, the staff were very professional, pleasant and attentive, we were offered refreshments, hot towels and newspapers when we boarded the plane. The drink selection comprised good quality world wines, 'interesting' cocktails and standard beers and spirits. The food menu offered three choices for each mealtime, the variations were enough to satisfy most tastes/ requirements with fish, meat, poultry and vegetarian options, the cabin staff also had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of noodles for my 7 year old son. The stand out here was the steak, I'm a major foody and can be very critical however it defies all logic how, outside of premium carrier first class, steak can be presented this well, seriously, I could have cut my steak with a butter knife, whoever made this happen needs a pay rise.<br><br>The aeroplane itself was a A350 (I believe), fairly quiet with 'herringbone' seat configuration four abreast, which works well. The inflight entertainment was a bit limited and could really do with a bit more variation but the games selection includes Tetris, which should soak up a few hours.<br><br>All in all a good experience with a carrier that I'd happily use again."
178,jk-liu,4,"On this traveling, we took the domestic flights and international flights of Vietnam Airlines. We found the same aircraft type, domestic seats have more space than the international. Maybe all flights have different spaces between seats in Vietnamese Airlines.<br><br>The cabin onboard was very clean, the flight attendants were friendly and the food was acceptable."
178,Voyager75428,1,"I have flown between Bkk <br>&amp; Sgn many times. I always try to avoid discount cheap airlines.<br>I booked with Vietnam Airlines @$194 return. After payment i found out that i had to pay minimum 23kg luggage and for a seat as you would expect to pay on discount airlines, this added an extra $200 to the cost of the flight. $394 BKK-SGN return. None of which is refundable. For this cost i could have flown from Mel-Sgn return on a discount airline cheaper than this.<br>Vietnam airways offer themselves as a premium airline,now only a discount airline service. <br>Travelers beware,avoid this airline and their scam. Its cheaper to book business class on discount airlines then its fly away no more to pay.<br>Come on Vietnam Airways lift your game."
178,Jenny J's Travel,5,The stewardesses are very nice. The food is so delicious. I would love to fly Vietnam airlines again.<br><br>Highly recommended 😊 This is now one of my favorite airlines to fly. <br><br>I used Vietnam airlines 4 times and looking forward for more flights
178,Richard_Smith567,4,"Compared to some of the other Vietnamese regional airlines, we were delighted with Vietnam air. Their check in process was simple, the flight and boarding were seamless. The only one issue I had was that the captain made an announcement: “Cabin crew, prepare for landing” and we probably flew for another 30 minutes. I was wondering if he was lost... Will use them again over many other airlines in the region."
178,Frequent traveller,2,"This is the worse airline by far that we have flown with. And we have traveled extensively around the world via many different airlines. Even though we were traveling via business class, the customer service we got was horrendous. I can't imagine how they treat their economy class customers!  First they sent us a change of flight time TWO DAYS before departure (Singapore - Frankfurt) by 2.5 hours earlier! Not 30 minutes, not 45 minutes but 2.5 hours earlier. We do not live in Singapore therefore we naturally had pre-booked weeks before a different flight into Singapore, arriving at approx. 3 hours before our original connecting flight with Vietnam Airlines.  The gap then didn't allow for 2.5 hours of flight change time. Trying to contact Vietnam airlines by phone is a futile effort. They are worse if not as bad as bargain airlines where it's impossible to get a hold of anyone by phone. Their automated phone system tells you to press X for English but nothing happens. It goes in a loop in Vietnamese. I then had to be creative and called up Singapore airport and asked to be transferred to Vietnam Airlines check in counter. Still didn't get a hold of anyone. Singapore then suggested I contact them via FB chat. So I did...oh my gosh, let me tell you, if I can gouge my eyes out it would have been less painful. Their English is so poor they cannot understand my concern. They kept insisting (for over an hour!!!) that the flight time didn't change even after I sent them screen shots after screen shots of email confirmation and email notification of change time. Why did you send me a notice of time change of flight if the time didn't change?! But they kept insisting they are right. Really? At the end (after 2.5/3 hours of chatting) they finally realized they did change the time. And the answer for that was - we are sorry for the inconvenience. REALLY? That's it? No offer to cover the cost of our new flight booking in order to connect to their flight, clearly all their fault. Unbelievable! Anyway, as far as business class goes, this airline is crap. Their toilets stink of urine (and there's always a random wash cloth on the floor that I think the flight attendants use to clean the floor?!) and it's the size of an economy class bathroom. The seats, while roomy like a typical business class cabin, are old, dirty and disgusting. They really need new upholstery. There are hardly any nooks and crannies to put away your stuff - no different than a premium economy in SIA for example. Flight attendants are friendly enough but they hardly spoke English. They really need to train their staff better if they want to be a global airline, that's all I have to say. Lounges are sub-par. You get better foods at the restaurants in the airport and seating much cleaner outside the lounges (in Vietnam). Stains on their seats and chairs and tables not cleaned on a timely basis. Disgusting. Never again."
179,Phil,3,"Personally, this airline is very ordinary. The aircraft was clean and quite fresh since it is still new and in a good condition. However, what they offer on the airplane for food and beverage is very normal. I only had two drink options which were water and coke."
179,Michael L,3,"Flew Business clas from HCMC to Hue, Check in was a breeze, as you would expect at Business Class, however they did not point out the express security so we went through normal security, fortunately it was not too busy. Had access to the lounge, this is very average for business class, the food is very average and there is not a very good selection of drinks. You get to boards first which means you get to the bus with everyone else and drive out to the plane. Once seated, you get an orange juice. This is a 1hr 25min flight.. A light snack was served which was a small pork roll, quite tasty, I asked for a beer and was given one, albeit a little begrugdingly. Our flight wa about 55 minutes late. Upon arrival we disembarked first and were taken to the terminal, only to have to wait with all the passengers for our luggage, about 20 minutes, all in all just ok."
179,Scrivscriv,5,"Staff are professional, courteous and only to happy to assist. Their interaction with children was warm and caring, really lovely to see.<br>Food was tasty and filling and overall the flight was uneventful, bar some turbulence.<br>Really love that the cockpit crew make announcements and tell the passengers about where the aircraft travelled in the air and advise about the weather, time etc at the destination country.<br>Will definitely fly with them again"
179,Glen M,4,Domestic short flights which despite no tv (not an issue for me) flew past quickly and comfortably. Food was good and the hostess / stewards were very good.  Excellent service from check in to the return flight shuttle bus that delivered us to the international departures for our flight home.
179,Gopi,5,"Having been living in Vietnam for more than two decades, had opportunity to use this Airlines on many occasions. Their aircrafts are very good, service is very attentive and food is ok (sometimes good, being vegetarian I have to say only sometimes).  Timings are mostly kept as scheduled and over 20 years never encountered even with one small problem. Would continue to use their services as always."
180,Bob M,3,While I appreciate the effort I will never understand why Asian carriers try to provide a meal on flights less than 3-4 hours. Once the plane makes altitude the flight attendants are blocking aisles with food and beverage carts. Then people try to squeeze around them to reach the toilet as soon as they finish eating leaving a food tray balanced on lopsided tables. Just give everyone a drink and get out of the way. Nobody is going to starve to death on a two hour flight. And pick a boarding method and stick to it. We flew this airline four times in two weeks and every airport had a different method or none at all.
180,Pam W,5,"First time flying with this airline and pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and service. Check in was easy, staff were helpful and in flight food and beverages were excellent. The only negative was that the seats appear to be closer together than in some other planes; however, for a flight of less than 10 hours it was fine. In flight entertainment worked well and everything was done in an extremely professional manner. I'll definitely be happy to use this airline again."
180,Daniel G,4,"We flew economy from Melbourne to HCMC and return on Vietnam Arlines and the experience was very good. the plane was on time both ways,and the service was excellent.We would fly Vietnam Airlines again"
180,Richard P,3,Basic Airline same as Jet Star.  Flight crew could speak a little English but catered for Vietnam people we had no plroblems at all getting on and off the plane.
180,Sani_Ayudha,4,"This is my first experience fly with Vietnam Airlines, and there's nothing special of all the services that I can highlighted. The leg room, the cabin crew.. all just in standard."
181,Stephen M,5,"We flew Premium Economy and really appreciated the extra leg and seat room, the Sky Priority check-in and boarding, cabin service and general comfort. The service was efficient and friendly, All of our 4 flights left on the dot and we experienced no delays. Highly recommended."
181,carolngoi,2,"My husband, toddler and I visited Hanoi for the first time and was hoping for a smooth flight with Vietnam airlines given it’s a full service airline. We booked a return trip from KL to Hanoi from 4 June to 7 June. On our flight there, it was a full flight and there were at least 4 flight attendants, 2 females and 2 males. My husband asked one of the male attendants for a blanket as it was quite cold on the plane and was told they’ll bring one to him soon. After a lengthy wait, my husband asked one of the female crew and was told they ran out of blankets. However, not five minutes later, the first male attendant brought him a blanket! So, the female attendant lied to my husband by telling him they had none! Another incident was that they were bringing around the drinks trolley and I asked for some water for my toddler’s water bottle as we had to empty it at the airport security. To my annoyance, I was told ‘later’ even though the drinks trolley was right there. She never returned to provide water for my toddler. I had to go to the galley and wait there until the male attendant to fill it up. It was a very unpleasant flight. <br>Upon check in at Hanoi airport to return to KL, we were at the economy class check in but was told to go to the business class check in, presuming because we had a toddler. When we got there, the lady at the counter questioned why we were there. I said we were told to use the business class counter. She grudgingly checked us into economy class. Our flight was delayed but the announcement was made after our original departure time. The flight back was good and uneventful, probably because it wasn’t a full flight. <br>Overall, I would probably not fly with Vietnam airline again given the experience we’ve had. They should definitely try to improve their customer service."
181,Mathew,4,"We flew premium economy, Boeing from Sydney to Hanoi, airbus from Hanoi to Paris. Width and leg space was a lot better on Booing Sydney to Hanoi.food was normal for flight. In-house entertainment was good. Disappointed that a lot of pricing at Hanoi Airport was in $US. Flying back in 2 weeks, see how it goes."
181,JustJane1961,4,"Premium economy was very good value for money - good amount of leg room, seats recline a long way, choice of meals etc."
181,Ian D,4,"Lounge in Ho Chi Min is fine, but the food offering very much caters for the locals and with only a little for westerners. Plenty of space and decent seating. The flight was efficient and the dinner offering was great. Small salad, warm bread role and chicken in a sauce with baby potatoes and veg. The meat was more veal or pork in texture but I really enjoyed it. The staff were very attentive on the 1hr 45 min leg but there was  no in flight entertainment but good big seats 2+2. There was a separate bus for priority passengers at departure, but we had a bridge at Changi."
182,Helen G,5,"I flew from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh with a connecting flight to Hue.  Whilst my luggage couldn't be checked through to Hue, there was an airline staff member waiting at the carousel for me and my daughter, to help get me to my connecting domestic flight on time.  We had about 1 hr 40mins to transit and it was tight.  It did take a long time for the luggage to come through however the lady from Vietnam Airlines walked us over to domestic and took us straight to the check in desk to get our boarding passes and we made it to our flight just a few minutes before boarding.  Love a full service flight. Have missed that having used Jetstar in the past.  <br>On our return no delays and luggage was checked all the way through from Danang to Melbourne so we didn't have to worry about collecting luggage in Ho Chi Minh or getting our boarding passes.  It was quite seamless."
182,yellowbird172,4,"First leg from Melbourne to Saigon on a near new A350 &amp; the second to Hanoi, later that evening, on an older A330. They are similar wide bodied aircraft (the A330 a little smaller) but the fights were very different experiences.<br><br>The A350 had a  luxurious interior with angled “herringbone” lie flat seating in a one/two/one configuration across the aircraft. <br><br>We departed 10:30 AM for an 9 hour trip with lunch being served an hour later. Food &amp; beverage choices &amp; quality were fine but service was awful. Wrong entree arrived with an unrequested cup of coffee &amp; with the bread roll not arriving until desert time! At all times, there was little conversation or interaction with the cabin crew.<br><br>Then, even though the flight was in daylight hours, the cabin crew pulled the window shades down on all the windows &amp; retreated to their crew area. This deprivation of natural light would do nothing to help with the 3 hour time zone adaptation needed.<br><br>By contrast, business class in the A330 was set up two/two/two across the aircraft with full length but tilted seating... not as comfortable to sleep on. Cabin crew were engaging from the moment of boarding with us being offered the option to move to window seats. Take off for the 2 hour flight was delayed by 40 minutes .....cabin crew advised us that the delay was due to baggage issues.<br><br>Drinks &amp; a light meal were served promptly with excellent, friendly service.<br><br>So the flagship, long haul international flight was let down by poor cabin crew service while the little local flight excelled!"
182,AppleAdam,2,"They just do not care about quality or service - even for Elite Plus passengers.<br><br>I missed the meal dinner because I was sleeping.  I approached the young cabin attendant and she said, “ It will take 1 hour to heat. Go back to your seat, I am busy”.  I then went to the rear of the aircraft and found some staff. Explained the situation and some stupid young girl said, “We only have fish”.  I explained that I was not some toe rag passenger and wanted my meal. A quick intervention from a senior member, “Yes sir, your pork meal will be with you soon”.<br><br>When will VietNam Airlines train these young silly staff to stop lying! They have no idea about customer service or quality."
182,Peggy Dixon,4,The flight was good. Flight crew were helpful and smiley which always helps!<br>I found the seats very small. I am only just over 5ft and when the seat was made into a bed there was no spare room. Not good if you are tall!!
182,mikeives2017,4,"Up until today onlt superlatives in respect of the Vietnam airlines experience.  Arrived in Hanoi were there is a 21 hour layover with accomodation in a first class hotel. The experience in obtaining the temporary visa at the airport not the best and too one and a half hours. Then to the Chalcedony hotel hanoi. At best 3 stars but rooms comfortable enough. We were given 3 meals in the dining room. Breakfast was a reasonsble buffet selection but all cold. Lunch was a set menu, pumpkin soup, chicken &amp; chips this was inedible and again cold. Dinner was, you guest it pumpkin soup, c old so we sent it back. The same bowels were obviously  put in a micowave and reheated but still luke warm. Main was described as ""beef steak"". Ag as in cold with the vegetables freeing. Meat was worse than inedible chips also cold. We did not even trry to est ours and left. To add insult to injury we were expected to pay for a bootle of water with no table warer available. Allvery dispointing as the flights,food and service on the aircraft has been excellent to date. Would fly th er m ag a in anytime but beware of the Chalcedony hotel."
183,Cynicoren,5,"When the check in attendant saw how tall me and my wife are, she seated us near the emergency exit - we didn't have to ask!<br>This was the first time in many flights I've flown that I was handled so efficiently and with care. <br>The flight itself was rather short (about 2 hours) , and they had excellent service in flight too."
183,JojoBreda,5,"We had 2 domestic flights during an organised north to south trip.<br>Was our firts time that we were flying with Vietnam airlines<br>What a nice experience.<br>Super friendly and just after take off whe got an fresh towel and a, drink.<br>Both flights were perfect.<br>Booked VA for our next trip, Amsterdam to Da Nang."
183,erika040,5,"found this airline to be great would definately fly with again. seats comfortable, nice food and great staff"
183,Joe S,4,Used to fly 4-5 flights all over Vietnam. Overall good experience. Really good if you are are sky priority . Avoid long check in lines. Seats are little  tight. Will make you check pretty much any bag in hour or less flights
183,Irna W,3,"This was our first time flying between domestic, good flight, fast check in, seats are enough comfortable."
184,Samantha I,4,We had flown Vietnam Airlines previously and flight was great. This time the flight was great but the service was a little slow. Assistant button was pressed and was left for 2 hours with no service.
184,Joeby,3,Flew multiple times with VA and they are ok yet there are things that will grind on you when flying with them. <br><br>Constant PA messages interrupting entertainment. We just want to relax when we get on a flight. The VA ads are not able to be skipped so you will soon know they word for word which is ok but apart from the safety video (hilarious anyway) why do we have to get so many updates?  PA updates at 12am and 2am woke up almost everyone on the flight and sitting at rear of plane we could barely make out what they were saying.  <br><br>Cabin was hot 🥵 and water was not offered until over an hour into service.  This is far too long.  We couldn’t buy water at the gate and were genuinely thirsty almost to distressed levels so I had to ask for some then they gave me a tiny cup.  I asked if I could have the bottle and the lady said no.  <br><br>Be much better to just give guests a can of coke or juice rather then pour glass.  Glass too small when thirsty.
184,Jon9344,3,"Checked in online but found ourselves waiting in a long baggage drop queue at the airport. The check in staff made a mistake with our baggage so we were a bit worried it wasn't going to make it back, thankfully it did.<br>We booked certain seats online through the check in on the app and on the occasions we have used Vietnam airlines on this holiday, 5 in total, we have found that even if you request certain seats, they will be changed once you bag drop anyway so a bit of a pointless exercise. <br>The flight was ok, leg room pretty good and the seats recline enough to get comfortable. The in flight entertainment wasn't that good to be fair and not that many things that i would have watched or listened too.<br>We found the staff a bit disinterested and doing the minimum on all the flights we have been on recently. <br>The meals were poor and i would advise anyone who may be a bit fussy with food, take your own because you wont like it. We found out the hard way. <br>There are only really two drinks services on the 13.5 hour flight which is at meal times and i found this disappointing. <br>On this flight, we enquired at the information desk in Vietnam about upgrading to premium economy as a treat for our return flight. We were told we didn't have this option due to the category of ticket we had, which was bought as a group ticket by a travel agent even though we were not expecting it to be free! On board however, there were lots of premium seats free so i don't understand the logic of not letting us pay to upgrade. <br>Average airline."
184,Donna A,2,"These planes were very cramped. Seat were tiny, rear pocket was so small you couldn't put anything in there for the flight, when the seat in front reclines - you have no room and cannot get to your stuff (which has to be on the floor because it doesn't fit in the pocket). Food was poor, domestic flights had better food. Service was terrible. No response to call light, no coffee/tea service. Next time would definitely choose to fly internationally with another airline."
184,Robby Aussie,2,Meal was not good and crew did their bare minimum. Also crew was sleeping during landing and take off - I was worried about the safety of this airline!!
185,Choo L,5,Good service. Seats were spacious and comfortable for economy class. Food was delicious and the toilets were cleaned and well-stocked.
185,Tina L,1,"We booked a round trip international trip from Japan to Vietnam and then 2 domestic flights within Vietnam for our family trip. To summarize:<br>1. Our flights kept getting switched. They would put us on the earlier or latest flights. This really upset us because we paid more money for the more desirable times. We got at least 4 flight changes out of 6 total flights. There's no point in paying for the most expensive flight because most likely, they will cancel it and put you at different time slot .<br>2. My mom is a vegetarian and getting this request was very difficult. Their website is not user friendly and can't be done online. I had to call the number within the US to make this request and I was living in Japan at the time (huge time difference). <br>3. On the last international flight home, I confirmed with the check in counter regarding my mom's vegetarian request and they confirmed it was requested. During the 6 hr flight (12 am to 6am), they were serving breakfast and the flight attendant said there were no vegetarian meals available. He did not seem apologetic and offered her food still despite having meat in it....this is really disrespectful. Also, we are able to speak Vietnamese so there were no language barriers as to why they couldn't explain why there were no vegetarian options. He just said there was no request so therefore there are none available on the plane.<br><br>This is probably the worst airplane experience and we flown United and Spirit. I've sent an email to Vietnam regarding this experience. I was surprised to see a response and they said they would look into this matter...it's been 2 months and I haven't received an update."
185,Parco W,1,"New baggage allowance updated info on website is very confusing. Not user friendly and being a full board carrier, too many categories to read. You have economy super lite, economy lite etc and all fals under the column presented in their website as Economy. Booking process is very difficult and info misleading."
185,Noel,5,"On time and with excellent service, this is the third time we have traveled Premium Economy with VA on this route. The aircraft is the 787 Dreamliner which provides an excellent environment (good cabin pressure and humidity). Service was attentive and meals had a choice of Asian or European menus. This class also gives you priority boarding, which makes the check in of luggage simple as you use the same check in desk as business."
185,Ellie N,3,"My trip to Vietnam on the 2nd of January, had many firsts. My first time travelling for 2019, travelling to Vietnam, my first time travelling with Vietnam Airlines and travelling on the state of the art Airbus A350, flying economy!. My plane registered VNA895 , only one year old, awaited me at Terminal 2, Gate 14A in current livery. It operated as VN780 to Ho Chi Minh from Melbourne. <br><br>We had an on time departure , pushing back 10 minutes after scheduled departure at 11:35am. Entering the aircraft, economy was in 3-3-3 configuration. You could clearly see the interior was spacious, even for economy. When i settled in my seat 35H, i was quite impressed with how much leg room I had. The TV Screens were of decent size and of high quality, though i wish there was a broader movie selection!.<br> The airshow was pretty cool though and i loved checking the progress every couple of hours in between movies.<br><br>About 2 hours into the flight, we had lunch served, it was fresh vegetable salad with smoked salmon with either stir fried beef with black pepper sauce and steamed rice or Malaysian stir friend chicken with kway teow noodles (which i selected as my main) complimented with a dinner roll and a delicious ginger bread cake. Needless to say i scoffed my lunch down . The cabin crew did what they had to do but I do wish they were a bit more friendlier. <br><br>Overall, the biggest praise was for the aircraft itself!. It was spacious, especially very quiet, and thanks to its state of the art technology, did not arrive feeling exhausted/ jet lagged as associated with older aircraft. The airline itself was good for the most part, my only con being the half friendliness of the cabin crew. After 7 hours and 48 minutes of flying, we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City."
186,Kristian N,5,We had good service with the airline the ground staff was helpfull .<br>In the air the food was not bad and the staff was polite we will use them again
186,Nicquay L,1,"Bought a ticket for my wife to return to Singapore. And also bought additional baggage a day later by calling their office.<br>Went through all the verification questions asked, including spelling out my wife's full name when I bought the additional baggages.<br>Long story short, my wife was at Tan Son Nhat airport today and was told that her name was reflected on the ticket was incorrect. I called up the airline office to clarify but instead of finding the caused of the issue and rectifying it. The so-called manager just went about repeating the airline's protocol and refuses to even listen about the situation.<br><br>If there is a typo error in the name, and when I repeatedly spell it out to your staff when I purchase the additional baggage why isn't this highlight to me when we pay the money? Is your staff just going through motion when they work?<br><br>What makes things worst, is that the so-called manager that I spoke with over the phone is only interested in regurgitating the protocol and not hearing the situation. She kept interrupting whenever I am trying to explain to her. She even had the cheek to say, ""Even if I want to help, I also cannot as the gate to the flight is closed. Please buy another ticket."" This means that she could assist but chose not to. We wasted more than an hour on such useless help.<br><br>Bear in mind you are a service provider, not a protocol regurgitator!!! Plus after I repeatedly spelt out the full name of my wife and your staff didn't make an effort to highlight to me, this clearly shows what kind of service this airline provides.<br><br>We ended purchasing another ticket for my wife which if the so-called manager could be the real service provider we would not have waste time and money for no particular reason other than a typo-error which should have been pointed out earlier. This airline is just simple out to con and good luck if you need their assistance. Cos you will never get any. <br><br>The Certificate of Excellence 2018 given by TripAdvisor is a joke!!!! Or did the airline just simply pay some money to get the certificate.<br><br>I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CON-AIR."
186,Ann O,4,"Our flights too and from Vietnam and Cambodia were fine.it was all the internal flights the delays cancellations and gate changes,which were constant through  out our trip and nobody seemed to know what was going on"
186,Martin C,4,Short flight (2hr) but good food offered and attentive service. Only downside is having to use the bus on leaving and arriving at Hong Kong. No in-flight entertainment (couldn't get the wifi to work) but again - short flight.<br>Would definitely consider Vietnam Airline business class for long haul after this.
186,Robert M,4,We upgraded to Premium Economy and we couldn't complain about anything service was great and the flight was good we would fly with them again.
187,612happyholidayer,4,"Flew Premium Economy from Syd - Hanoi (Dreamliner)and then SGN to Melbourne (airbus 350.  The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room but would rate the Dreamliner higher.<br>The inflight service was satisfactory - equivalent to QANTAS economy on  a bad day.  Food was so so.  Certainly not the equivalent of QA NTAS prem economy.<br>Our bags were labelled priority but this didn't mean much.  On arrival at Melbourne 2/3 bags arrived quickly, whilst the 3rd was nearly the last to appear.  On arriving in Hanoi, the bags took forever.<br>Check in was smooth and easy.<br>Wouldn't be my first choice of airline for a European flight, but when travelling to Vietnam form Australia where there are limited options, they did the job."
187,Ferriytale,5,I booked it as it was cheap but only the morning flight that I cursed to myself. I booked for window but apparently must gave it away to family that occupied my seat. Overall it was clean and nice cabin.
187,Vladimir P,5,"I am traveling a lot and have never had such a help from customer service like from Vietnam Airline employees.Was changing a ticket of couple of time.Changes need to be done online but also they are very helpful on the phone.In the country where most of the people speaks hardly any english,Vietnam airline customer help,easiness of online service is tje best I have ever came across to.Pure number 10!"
187,Kevin0309c,2,Traveled often with Vietnam Airlines for business trip because there's few choice in domestic flight in Vietnam. Don't be surprised with delay because sometimes this occurred often. In-flight meal service can be the same for a long period of time without creativity and any change. There's no in-flight entertainment so it's better to prepare a book or some music for your journey.
187,Andy Nguyen,5,"I bought air tickets for my family to have a summer vacation in promotion time of Vietnam Airlines, so the price is really affordable.<br>Friendly sfaffs, yummy snacks and great service.<br>Highly recommend to you!"
188,Michael D,4,"Very clean and good service. Comfortable seats, lots of leg room. The price is very cheap and great value. Would fly with them again."
188,Lisa B,5,"This airline provided good, reliable service at a resonable price. I have travelled with VN many times and will do so again in the future."
188,Robyn S,5,We upgraded to Premium economy and couldn’t fault our flight.<br>Great food and service....plenty of attention as day flight and empty seats.<br>The cabin crew were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.<br>I thought their film selection could have been larger but that was the only grumble.<br>On our return night flight the food was not so good but loved the extra room and comfort of Premium economy.
188,JM Emma,5,"In my first flight with Vietnam airlines, I felt fairly value for money. The airplane is clean, comfort and aircrew was helpfull. Eventhough the English was not pretty good but they were attentive."
188,SPS,5,A short haul but very relaxing. The cabin crew were very alert and hospitable. The announcement from flight deck were very clear and crisp. value for money
189,Sven K,1,Sat I plane more than 2 hours waiting for people to arrive from other places. Aircon switched off. <br>I cannot recond this airline to anyone. No way I'll fly with them again. <br><br>They try to save money so they don't have to pay for hotels or rerouting a few people that are late on the cost of cost of a lot of people.
189,Jue,4,"The aircraft is comfortable and clean. It is good to see all female flight attendants wear their traditional costumes when they are on board. I like the most is the fresh face washer, the tropical fruit with the food tray and also the smile on all flight attendants’ faces. However, the aircraft arrived late resulting the delay of my flight"
189,MargieCG,1,"Tiny seats, pointless to have a food menu printed as the available option is just one (on both 14hr flights) white wine and sparkling on board is always warm. Staff very smily but not helpful and not a great air flow as the smell after 2hrs on the plane would be quite instense."
189,Prabhjeet S,4,"Very smooth experience.  From booking to baggage collection. Courteous check in staff, helpful and polite gate staff and attentive cabin crew."
189,BabyBoyLA,5,I made a serious mistake with my luggage to Hong Kong.  Nothing to do with them but they took care of it in 15 min and my luggage was in Hanoi when I arrived.  Nicest people really went out of their way to help me.  All the  Vietnamese I met were so nice and helpful.
190,Giovanni D,3,"Took 3 domestic flights on Vietnam Airlines. These comments apply to all 3 flights. The planes are clean and all recent Airbus models. Seating is fairly standard; leg room is sufficient. The personnel are friendly and professional. All of our flights were on time. What is really surprising is that the only beverages offered on board are either water or sodas.  There is no alcohol and no hot drinks such as coffee or tea and no snacks of any sort,"
190,Ben Ngo,5,"For private holiday trips, I oftentime choose low-cost airlines. <br>But for my business trips, I always choose Vietnam Airlines for inbound flights, as there's less headache about flight time delays or bad service."
190,Roger W,5,"On time, cabin crew efficient and courteous and aircraft clean. Great range of food and entertainment many and varied. Could not fault the service."
190,Laura L,5,First time i used this airline and happy to recommend it. Good choice of films to watch and decent food. Would use it again.
190,annaleetse,5,"The first time I travel by Vietnam airline ,I have a good impression ,the ticket is reasonable price ,the in-flight food is good ,I like to travel with Vietnam airline and visit  Vietnam again .The flight is on time and the allowed luggage was 2 luggages .The meal is very cheapin the Ho chi Ming city ,it is a saft city ,lot of sight seeing ,the local people can speak good English ,they are very friendly."
191,fossefield,3,"We travelled to Vietnam and Cambodia with Cox and Kings on a small group tour in February 2019 on an upgraded seat package. We received details of our outward and homeward seat numbers in October 2018. On all flights, including internal ones, my husband and I were sitting in adjacent seats except for the return flight from Ho Chi Min to LHR when we were allocated seats 4 rows apart. This is a long overnight flight and we really needed to be sat together as my husband suffers from Sleep Apnoea which is a concern, particularly when he is unable to use his sleep machine, so we asked our travel agent and Cox and Kings directly if we could sit together. Neither were able to alter this seat allocation with Vietnam Airlines.  When we checked in at Siem Rea, for the connecting flight to HCM we asked the lady on the Vietnam Check In Desk if it was possible to sit together and she confirmed that the seats either side of my husbands were available but that she was not able to access the computer to make any alteration. She advised us to check with the desk at the 'transit' at HCM and they shouls be able to make the alteration.<br>When we did this we were told that the seats had been allocated to people upgrading at check in at HCM.<br>Very, very disappointed at the treatment we received by this airline, particularly as they were made aware of my husbands medical condition by our travel agent at the time of booking the holiday."
191,melissav1964,5,"Great airline to travel with. When we arrived to our seats there were already blankets, slippers, toothbrush accessories and an eye mask. Tge food was excellent and plentiful and we even got a menu beforehand to choose our food. Would definitely fly with them again"
191,Eddie W.S. Lo,4,"This is the first time I flied Business class on Vietnam Airlines from this route.  Surprisingly, the crew spoke good English and they were much better than Asian route between Hanoi - HK, Shanghai - Hanoi or Tokyo - Hanoi.  The food and beverage had good range of choice.  The flight was full but the crew worked well and efficient.  I paid less than other airline on this but received good value of service and food."
191,Rob Halsall,5,We had a great flight into Ho Chi Minh and a smooth transfer to a domestic flight into Danang both with Vietnam Airlines<br>Staff at check in were amazing and directives onto connecting flight were clear.<br>Food on board was great
191,lornachuan,5,"Vietnam airlines always offer layover in other country before your country of destination with the same price as of direct flight. Maybe for others they don't like but for me I like as I will have the chance to see another country aside from the country I'm visiting in . I like Vietnam airlines because they have in flight LCD screen, 20 kg luggage allowance + 7 kg hand carry, a nice meal with very affordable ticket price. Then, their layover is 24 hrs that you have time to stroll around the city center. For me every pennies are worth to board on Vietnam airlines. Flight is on time, flight stewardess is friendly, the aircraft is clean"
192,Yann P,3,"I live in Vietnam since 10 years<br><br>I took many times the national company in domestic<br><br>It is time to renew some A321 (carpet, seats, fly)<br><br>I have one comment about the company:<br><br>One fly Paris to Ho Chi Minh in August 550 euros (2 ways)<br>One fly Ho Chi Minh to Paris in August 890 euros (2 ways)"
192,Graham D,5,Nice aircraft very pleasant staff and most important of all left on time and arrived on time.  Would definitely fly with them again.
192,roastduck,4,"New planes on both legs from Singapore to HCM to Incheon (A350). I would say it's not up to a Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific economy class standard, but definitely beats flying any LCC. Enjoyed the stopover in HCM, managed to get some hot coffee and food during my transit, and the price of the ticket was also a great incentive to fly VN."
192,mickjosieitalia,5,"This airline was much better than expected. Service and ease of boarding was great. The flight was on time, and quite comfortable. Food was of a good standard also. Would not hesitate to use them again."
192,Khanh H,4,The plane so big<br>The time not delay<br>The staff so very friendly<br>Arrived safe and on time.<br>I fly from Hanoi to Pleiku and very satisfied with Viet Nam airline.<br>Thanks you
193,Charmaine B,3,"We slept!! But yes you get what you pay for.....service not good, food not good on flight or in most lounges. At one airport we had to lug our cabin bags down stairs and catch a bus to the terminal.<br>They got us there safely and on time and didn’t lose our bags so that was a bonus!!"
193,Peter L,4,"Travelling on Vietnam Airlines was a pleasant experience.<br>The staff were pleasant and the food service was acceptable.<br>They pride themselves on on time departure, and in this instance departure and arrival were on time."
193,EL L,3,Airline itself was fairly good. Flight left and arrived on schedule. However the online check-in was problematic. Unable to check-in using phone or laptop (page not loading properly) and had to borrow a friend's laptop. Friend had the same problem with his phone.
193,pjkeeble,4,First leg of flight was great. Staff lovely right from check in. Comfortable and enough leg room. Food was ok and plane clean and looked fairly new. <br>Much older plane with a code share to Siem reap from HCMC. Short flight so that was ok. Would definitely fly Vietnam airlines again
193,Peter A,4,"This airline is ok to use when you go to Vietnam but if you need to transit in Vietnam need to consider longer transit time, normally very crowded"
194,Madi 🏃🏼‍♀️,4,We have flown Vietnam airlines on 2 seperate occasions about 18 months apart and found on both occasions that their service was outstanding. Staff were very professional and helpful. Would highly recommend to others.
194,Andy Comrie,4,Strict luggage max weight plus one only carry on.<br>The flight itself was pleasant but if you need anything you should ask.
194,Emmaisoutnabout,4,"I've taken this flight twice this year. Its an overnight flight and you land in Sydney about 8am so you want to get a few solid hours of sleep, especially if you are landing and heading into a work day in Sydney. On my first flight I had 3 seats to myself so I was very happy.  I had a decent amount of sleep but was still useless the next day. I booked  the premium economy on my most recent flight and was thrilled with the difference, The catering is faster with designated staff for the area and seat was conformable and reclined a lot of leg room. The flight form Sydney to Ho Chi Minh is a day flight so super easy - 4 movies and you have arrived, although I noticed on this trip a significant decline in box office movie offers. They have inflight shopping and through out all flights staff are able to provide drinks and snacks."
194,jacquelineK4971YN,5,On time easy to book and very cheap internal travel. Good service and would recommend as it saved so much time instead of catching trains and buses. Flew from Hue to Hanoi and then a week later Hanoi to HCMC.
194,FrenchBlueeyes,3,Flight was ok and the airlines staff were remote and not very friendly. Travelled throughout Vietnam from the north to the south and this was our experience.
195,eddykpaxtourstravel,5,very friendly and efficient crew. meals always served on time with two choices of food. ample beverages offred
195,ChG,5,"Great service, good food, comfortable seating and the ticket price is reasonable. Maybe Only one down thing (to some people) is the waiting time at Saigon too long, but it’s not a problem to me as I can use this stop to visit viet nam as well."
195,Bezzar,4,"Lovely staff, the food was enjoyable. The airfare was a reasonable price. I would definitely fly with them again."
195,Lars,4,I am Handicapped and use a crutch to move around. The crew made sure all crew knew and were always available. We had a choice between Asian style or American style meals. I chose the Asian style. The meals were delicious with ample beverage service. Thankyou Vietnam Airlines for making my Emergency return to USA memoriable.
195,395moira,5,From check in to in flight all done very well. The aircraft was new and the seats and leg room were both good. I am quite tall and was not uncomfortable at all. We were given hot towels for refreshing which was great. We had a second internal flight with this airline and were equally satisfied with the standard.
196,Steve F,4,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines a few times around SE Asia in recent years and it always works out well. Decent planes, quick checkin, boarding and baggage collection, freindly staff."
196,Kevin Hawthorne,5,"The airline was extremely great, we went to Saigon, on to Korea, back to Hanoi on to Cambodia, back to Saigon AND home to AUSTRALIA. I can not complain about THE Vietnam airlines. Booking was very easy, seating was good and comfortable food very good and plenty OF, SERVICE very pleasant the staff was always ready to help easy transfer to other flights  and we had a great holiday except the tour DMZ IN Korea which is ANOTHER story the VIETNAMESE airlines is my FAVORITE for cost, comfort, meals, bookings, transfer,"
196,Pascal F,5,"In fact, it was economy premium, between eco and business. A little less cheap, much more confortable. The flight is much shorter than in any other company thank to the direct flight. Excellent confort and service. All of the Vietnamese kindness in brand new and modern planes (A350)."
196,RainbowDivers,4,Perfect timing. Midnight departure; arrive Heathrow at 7am.<br>Standard food + drinks. Good range of Videos + TV Programmes.
196,James,5,"It's a long flight to Ho Chi Minh City, but with Vietnam Airlines the trip was smooth and comfortable. I have my own favourite seat with lots of leg room and was fortunate to secure it again this trip.<br><br>The staff are always friendly and welcoming and the service I've had has always been first rate. <br><br>I'm a fussy eater and the food is okay, it is airline food. Water and drinks are always available and I've found flying with Vietnam Airlines a pleasant way to spend eleven hours out and fourteen back.<br><br>They are great value for money."
197,jayned2001,4,"We flew premium economy from London to Hanoi. Everything was great, from check in, boarding. Seats were very comfortable. Food was excellent. A bit slow coming round with drinks but no problem getting up to get some. <br>However, our return flight from Saigon was a totally different experience. Boarding was a complete shambles with economy passengers boarding before first class and premium economy. Food not as good and even fewer drinks offered."
197,Suunytimes,1,"We had 2 internal flights - both significantly delayed with very little information provided regarding delay. Nearly missed connecting flight to London. Economy class cramped, checked in on line but was allocated different seats on arrival at airport. Supposed to email a link to online check in 24 hours prior to departure not received. <br>Films awful, same going as coming back. Food cold. Not very safety conscious- cabin crew didn’t carry out basic checks. Didn’t collect rubbish throughout flight. All in all very poor and would forfeit a direct flight to use a decent airline."
197,M. L.,4,"While finding a flight to go to Busan during the June peak travel season, I came across Vietnam Airlines with the best fit for my schedule. My traveling partner insisted I take it up and I do not regret taking that advice. The food was decent, the flight was made comfortable with the staff's attention to providing wet wipes upon boarding, providing pillows and blankets, explaining the menu and attending to our needs. The leg from Vietnam to Busan had new touch-screens which were useful without fiddling a remote around a seat."
197,John S,3,"Outward flight was quite good. Modern aircraft ,comfortable business seating and good food. Service was O.K.<br>Return flight was substandard. Poor service and unfriendly cabin staff combined with average food."
197,polletseb,1,"I booked a flight ticket to Hanoï, and i received 6 SMS today on my personal phone number about private transport service from noi bai airport to Hanoï city.  It happens every time when i Book a local flight and this is unacceptable leak of private information."
198,Daniel Pham,5,"Flight was on time. I was upgraded to Premium Economy and yes it was so amazing. The seat, service and food were simply perfect. Definitely worth the money"
198,Thảo Đ,4,"Very professional, good seat, good aircon. The staffs were very helpful but seemed not really friendly."
198,bruce m,4,The overall flight was good. The only problem was the movie choice. Most of the movies were Asian based. This is Ok as the great majority of passengers were too. No recent released ones. Nothing from Europe and only a few American movies that had no real appeal. Food was great. I would fly with them again.
198,kaminibendesai,5,Flight was on time and services was good. Flight was long hours but lots of choice  of movies and  comfortable seats made easy.
198,Rob25436,4,My wife and I flew Premium Economy from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh and then Economy to Da Nang. Our seats were excellent and a long way better than the seats we had in Cathay Pacific last year. The food choices were limited but what we had was good and the cabin service was attentive. This is an airline I would have no hesitation in using again.
199,damianb,4,"Flew premium economy to Vietnam. Was conitnually asked to close shutter during middle of the day so people could sleep. On return was also asked to do the same in the middle of the night, why?"
199,holidayitisAustralia,4,"Very comfortable seating which flattens out completely. Quite hard as a mattress though. <br>Good movies available and meals were very good. Lots of variety. <br>A very quiet cabin and the Dreamliner provided lighting to reduce jet lag. Didn't work for me!<br>Much more reasonable price to business class of other airlines but the downside is poor connections on the return journey. Had a 10 hour stopover and a domestic flight before head g back to Autsralia. Regardless, was worth the saving in dollars."
199,James P,5,My wife and I flew to Vietnam by Vietnam Air we up Graded to Premium Economy  what a difference it makes the chairs were extra leg room and the cabin crew looked after you fantastic if you want anything you just had to ask it was worth the extra money if we fly again we will upgrade again.
199,Rodney Widgery,4,Very good service meals were very nice  would recommend flying with Vietnam Airlines anytime would not hesitate flying with them again
199,greatxpectations,4,"Large Dreamliner plenty of room.row 26 outer is emergency exit more legroom seats.<br>Staff were great flight was 12 hrs,left Lhr 11am and served lunch then a snack two hours before arrival.drinks service shown in menu but you have to ask.(gratis).<br>If you get hungry you can ask for pot noodles.<br>Return flight from Saigon was similar ,night flight.<br>Quite comfortable economy fortunately we weren’t next to large travellers ."
200,trever w,5,"We will only fly directly to Vietnam from London, it is the fifth time we have used Vietnam Airlines, long haul in economy is tuff, but we really get looked after so yes indeed great service."
200,Graham A,4,"I booked a return flight from London Hearhrow to Da Nang and was overall pleasantly surprised at the service Vietnam Airlines offered as this was the first time that I had used this airline, The aircraft (Boeing 787 Dreamliner) was clean and comfortable and although the cabin service was not as slick as say that of Singapore Airlines the crew were friendly and helpful. Some small details let it down though; drinks were not offered freely apart from with the meals, the meals themselves were not as hot as they should have been and the hot towels were cold. My major complaint concerns the booking.  I booked directly with the airline on line and  was a little surprised to find that I was only offered one connecting flight from Ha Noi to Da Nang outbound and likewise one flight from Da Nang to Sai Gon on the return. Not having access to the schedules I accepted this although it meant long lay overs at both airports.  I was therefor surprised on arriving in Ha Noi at 05:15  (local time) to notice that two flights left for Da Nang before the one I was booked on meaning I had to kick my heals for over three hours.  It was even worse on the flight home where I had a wait of six hours in Sai Gon before my London departure.  On check in I was informed that as the stop over was for more than five hours they could not check my bags in for the entire trip and I would have to collect them and then re-check them in.  On querying this I was then offered a later flight that would preclude this annoyance.  By this time it was too late to change as I had the choice of a three hour wait at Da Nang and then another three at Sai Gon or the one long wait at the second airport.  If these extra flights were available why wasn't I at least offered the choice at time of booking instead of just being allocated inconvenient flights with long lay-overs?  This is a shame as apart from this I enjoyed my trip with Vietnam Airlines"
200,Ashley L,5,"We were flying Melbourne to Siem Reap. Our connecting flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Siem Reap (code share) was cancelled, so we had to stay overnight in Ho Chi Minh City. It is always a problem when a flight is cancelled, however they made the experience a pleasant one. The ground staff at the airport were excellent - they met us at the gate, walked us through customs and baggage collection, arranged for a car to the the hotel and booked us to stay in an excellent hotel - including dinner and breakfast, all at the airlines expense. The same service from the hotel to the airport and through customs was provided again the next day."
200,Sarah D,5,"International service was very good.  Food was of high standard. I'd happily fly the international service again. <br>Domestic internal flight wasn't as clean for one flight. But overall,  a good experience."
200,Joyce R,2,Do not fly this airline as the seats are small so if like me you are a larger size you are cramped into the seat also the food was disgusting and could not eat on flight it was very uncomfortable but we did meet a very nice young lady on the flight
201,Somersetallsorts,1,"We have flown Business Class with this Airline several times BUT NEVER AGAIN.<br>A few days before our departure our Travel Agent was advised that VA had changed our flight. Instead of a direct flight Ho Chi Mhin to HRW they proposed Hanoi to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to HRW. WE refused to accept this and asked why ? VA advised the flight we had paid for "" might be cancelled"" ....A LIE...We knew other people who were booked on the same flight and they had been told it was NOT being Cacelled.. VA then claimed ""We might not have a Business class cabin on that flight""....ANOTHER LIE. We said OK we will accept Economy seats and take a refund, VA said ""it's full no seats left"" ANOTHER LIE. We said we can stay at our resort a few more days and you can compensate us for the extra cost, VA said ""there are no more flights before your visa's expire""....ANOTHER LIE. We eventually werte provided with seats in business class as we had paid for 4 days later than our original flight. The extra cost to us was $1000. On that flight at breakfast we wete told ""sorry we have run out of some items, would you like BEAD AND JAM"".... some business class breakfast. Since returning to England we and our Travel Agent have been contacting VA ""customer Service"" and therir head office seeking .... an HONEST explaination, an apology and some form of compensation. SO far they have not had the decency to even reply to either us or our Travel Agent. I have delayed posting this review to enable VA time to behalf with some honesty and decency, clearly they have none of either."
201,Isabel B,5,"The flight we took was only an hour and ten minutes but we had ample leg room, a complimentary drink and took off on time. Could not complain about a single thing. Would definitely fly with Vietnam airline again."
201,Sharlene S,4,Excellent assistance from Vietnam Airlines staff in Luang Prabang<br>The aircraft was clean and comfortable<br>Check in isgreat if they are satisfied that your visa to enter Vietnam is to their satisfaction. It’s a whole different ball game if they aren’t satisfied<br>Air crew were courteous
201,N Le,5,"Having flown Economy on previous flights with Vietnam Airlines, I decided to treat myself and my 11 year old daughter to premium economy seats flying from LHR to Phu Quoc Vietnam via Hanoi last Easter school holidays. So well worth the money!! <br><br>Bigger, wider comfortable seats.  Welcome drinks served as soon as we boarded.  The cabin is quieter as there are only 34 seats.  I felt a lot more relaxed on this flight compared to flying in economy.  I booked the seats about a week after they were released on the website and the prices are very fair. <br>Food was nice, plenty of drinks (I don't drink alcohol so can't comment on alcoholic beverages), service was good and quick. <br><br>Unfortunately now my daughter won't fly economy again to Vietnam so once again we're booked in Premium Economy for next Easter Holidays. Love flying Vietnam Airlines! Great airline that flies directly to Vietnam from London. <br><br>Only downside was we were waiting for nearly 4 hours in Hanoi domestic terminal before our connecting flight. Shame Vietnam airlines couldn't schedule earlier connecting flights to Phu Quoc and also I had to collect the luggage from the International Terminal and re-check it in again at the Domestic terminal even though I booked LHR to Phu Quoc  with Vietnam airlines they hadn't checked the luggage all the way though to the final destination. Hanoi Domestic terminal seriously some investment."
201,Julien Courant,1,"From the beginning, we were informed there was a problem. Flight schedule at 2 PM. We receive regular updates initially late arrival (true?), then 3 PM, 4 PM,5 PM, 6 PM, 7PM technical problem but boarding to come...9 PM we were informed that the flight was finally rescheduled to the next day at 12. We were offered food for 15 euros and hotels or taxi voucher for those leaving in Paris. But for that we needed to go to back to immagration the other way ... to do another 2 hours of queue!!! Finally got my taxi vouchers and went to my family house in Paris. Some of the passengers were sent to Eurodisney hotels at 1 hours of bus! I Arrived at Midnite home. We were told to come back at 9 am the following day. Then no news until 1030. Where we were told to wait another 30 minutes! Then all passengers were getting really upset until we were told the technical problem wasn't still solved and to wait until 4 PM. People with babies, business men, bagpackers...were all schocked by that treatment. I came back again home with taxi vouchers (that works at least) and decided the flight to another destination for tomorrow (Ho Chi Minh). At a summary, I stayed 15 hours in the airport, changed flights, am late for meetings. Technical problem can happen and better to figure out in the ground than in the sky but informing people with clear direction is the basic. Shame to Vietnam Airlines. Am flying with them tomorrow to HCM, let's see. Hopefully they'll read that review. I flew Vietnam Airlines, all was good...until today."
202,banANA,5,"I flew Vietnam Airlines economy Hong Kong to Saigon and on to Heathrow. I have nothing but praise as they truly went above and beyond in many small aspects reminiscent of airlines in a bygone era, such as the damp towels, great selection of tasty food and so much I couldn't even eat it all. We had a long layover in Saigon (as expected) and were surprised to be given a meal voucher and special transit lounge to pass the time in.  Compared with other recent flights, there was plenty of leg room and the seat reclined enough that you could know you had reclined. In flight entertainment on the long-haul had a good enough selection too.  We had a last minute gate change followed by a boarding delay in Hong Kong, but the reasons were clearly explained, along with an apology. Some English was a little difficult to understand, but hey, it's an airline from a non-English speaking country. Top marks Vietnam Airlines!"
202,Luba P,4,"The airfare was reasonably priced therefore i was not expecting much. However, I could see that they were trying to match Singapore Airlines with their service. Not quite there yet ,but at least they were trying. Seats were roomy for economy and their airline food was quite edible. Good in flight entertainment. Will definitely seek them out for future trips."
202,Koloblicin,4,"It is my second time flying with Vietnam Airlines and I thought the service is quite good. They attended to my needs within a reasonable period of time. The seat is quite comfortable, but that will depend on how tall you are. Also, the food is quite edible but I am not very picky with food anyways. You can also do on-line check-in with your app and choose your desired seats at no extra charge."
202,John,1,"Flown to the Far East on several occasions,but by far this is the worst airline I have experienced regarding the so called ‘food’it was best described has diabolical.my wife was served the identical meal for breakfast as the dinner a few hours before.anyway we did not eat any of meals it was garbage!"
202,Ausra,5,"Very clean, nice big plane. On time. Some free drinks and a blanket . Definitely would fly with them again."
203,Suzi P,4,"Pleasantly surprised as we hadn’t flown with them before but staff were good- some could have smiled more though- the food was really good for airplane food, and free wine was a nice surprise. The gourmet was bumpy but that’s no ones fault and they were understanding when I asked for wine to calm nerves. Lots of leg room compared to other flights. Early landing. Can’t complain!"
203,TH06MAY,3,"Arrived 3 hours before the flight. Asked at the Vietnam Airlines service desk where to check in as there was no check-in desk/gate on the boards. Queued where instructed and once we reached the front of the queue we were ushered away back to the service desk and told that our flight had been cancelled and that there were no other direct flights that day! We were given the option of an overnight hotel and 15:00 flight the next day or to fly to Danang and get a connecting flight to Siem Reap, arriving at 22:20, just over 2.5 hours later than planned. We opted for the latter. With only 40 minutes until the takeoff time, the Service Desk guy got a staff member to drive us across to the domestic departures terminal and we managed to jump the check in queue and use the crew lane to get through the security scans. We made the flight and the connecting flight but it was very very stressful - we never got an explanation of why our direct flight was cancelled, nor why we didn’t receive any prior notification. This would be a 1 Star review but the Service Desk Manager made it a 3 Star."
203,J Swift,2,"On our flight out to Vietnam on the 6th June VNO54. you could not fault the cabin staff.<br> Coming back on the 22 June, was a different flight. The cabin crew were not very helpfull or customer friendly.  For instance, they woke my wife to ask if he would like a meal, when serving breakfast before we landed I had to ask for my coffee as they forgot mine &amp; a few others.  I know we were in economy but that should not make any difference to the service you get."
203,Greggggg123,4,It's only 1 hour and 20 minutes to Hanoi so this was fine. Much prefer it over a budget airline and the price was fairly cheap.
203,Paris T,4,"It was a good fight the air line staff were very welcoming, the uniforms could do with a little up dating, the food was ok, the on board entertainment was great, I would of perfered to of sat on the end because I like to get up to much. Over all I had a good flight, I would use them again."
204,Dave Surath,5,"Friendly,knowledgeable staff.Splendid food and services.Spic and span bathrooms.Well trained staff was evident from my arrival onto my flight to landing."
204,David S,4,"Not a long haul but - thanks to very appealing in flight catering, a complimentary newspaper, and friendly cabin crew the journey went over smoothly and efficiently."
204,Jackie F,5,Excellent service. Friendly cabin crew. This was my 4th time flying and would recommend Vietnam Airlines. Check in was easy and very pleasant flight.
204,Ian O,2,"Terrible food which was cold ,flight attendants where not at all welcoming at all .we where on a 13 hr flight and we hardly saw the attendants.every flight we had during our tour around Vietnam the flight times where changed with no apologies.budget air line"
204,Natthan K,5,"I took Vietnan Airlines from KUL to ICN (via Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh). For the flight from Hanoi to ICN, the flight was delayed due to some aircraft operation, but I was excited to fly Airbus A350. The aircraft is new and clean with blue coloured seat, cabin crews were nice and kind even I asked for water several times."
205,Jane A,5,Flight was on time.  Food was excellent.  Staff was pleasant and friendly. Seat was comfortable with adequate leg room.  We were able to claim our baggages immediately.
205,Donald,2,"I have been flying with Vietnam airlines for ten years. The experience is okay, the foods so so, the planes are okay also. The problems for me start with the airlines so called ""loyalty program"", because in spite of them claiming they have one, it seems it only applies to first class. I can testify to this because I along with my family and business associates have spent around $150,000, and for my loyalty I have not received so much as a free pen or toothpick holder, let alone an upgrade, an upgrade for me is like the legendary sasquatch, I've heard fantastic tales but never actually seen one in real life. And when I asked staff at the airports for advice on how to ask questions of the airline and its so called ""loyalty program,"" they simply hand me an email address to contact, so I write to them, but no answer, and so I write again, no answer, and then a third email, no answer. I actually did call the Vietnam airlines switchboard and I asked about the lack of a response, the young Vietnamese woman who took my call begged me please not to ask her to take the matter to her bosses, when I asked her why? She answered me that, ""because my boss will get angry at me if I share your complaint with them."" My advice to Vietnam Airlines, please look beyond the shiny ""Business class passenger"" and take notice that there are some people traveling in Economy for years who have paid you thousands of dollars more than a one or two time Business class passenger. Respectfully, Donald G"
205,DiBurch2014,5,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines several times and always found them friendly, reliable, the service good and the seats comfortable. Never had any holds up or problems."
205,Denbur,5,Does what I says on the tin. Professional staff dad a very good job with a smile. All good with the loading and unloading. Good service
205,bling82016,5,"Vietnam Airlines was the carrier we went on to travel Hanoi, Hoian, (Da Nang) Ho Chi Minh. <br>Our outward trip in economy was really good, lovely clean planes, courteous staff, nice food, great care. <br>I was injured in Hoian and returned Business Class to Melbourne. From the ground staff to the on board staff, they could not have been more courteous, gentle and helpful. We did not have to even think about luggage, being  wheel chaired and transferred at Ho Chi Minh. They took care of everything with great grace and courtesy. <br>Sandi Trajdos"
206,Denise H,4,"The best long haul flight we have ever had. The service was excellent, the flight was seamless, the food outstanding and the lounges were very good also. The only problem was time keeping. All of the flights, bar one, were late leaving!!"
206,Sonja G,5,"We flew Vietnam Airlines the first time as a part of a tour of Vietnam &amp; Cambodia. Our tour consisted of a return International flight and six domestic flights.  On all flights, the staff were friendly and most helpful.  The food on the International flights was good as far as airline food goes.  We would definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
206,jzpietrzyk,5,"From start to finish the on-board staff were very professional, elegantly dressed and upbeat. The food was tasty and at just the right temperature. I will certainly be flying with them whenever I am in their service region."
206,AJ O'Grady,4,My wife and i have travelled on Vietnam Airlines a few times over the last few years. We have found the staff very accommodating and helpful. The meals are good and the in flight entertainments is also good. The planes are clean and comfortable. Vietnam Airlines meet our expectations consistently and consistency is very important in the airline business. We will be definitely flying with them  again in the future.
206,AGreatTraveller,5,"This is a great flight with VietnamAirlines ,Food was Okay , Staffs are Friendly , Good seat , i love Vietnam Airlines"
207,Petange,4,"Following a good start with breakfast in the Qantas Lounge which code shares with Vietnam airlines, we flew business class in an A350 plane, which was showing signs of wear and tear. The usual hot towel and drink were offered at the commencement, always welcome. All meals and service were very good, perhaps not as classy as other airlines we have travelled on. The entertainment offering was very average and struggled to find a current movie in English. Overall, a good flight."
207,tony r,1,I have flown Vietnam airlines 10 + return international flights over Asia and  australia with multiple domestic flights. For the most part they are excellent. However my last flight back to Australia reminded me of a previous flight. There is one crew no matter the class of your ticket that are rude to a point of almost aggressive. I spoke to a senior cabin crew member and he almost died of fright that I dared speak to him.. there is also a female cabin crew member that is so bad I shrunk in my seat when spoken to (barked at). it has made me think even as a previous gold lotus member and current titanium member to travel with another carriage services.
207,Huay Ping,1,"We were shocked to see massive use on unnecessary single use plastic at the lounge. All the forks and knifes used were plastic disposables. It would be great if the lounge an replace it with reusable forks and knife. Besides, all the dried noodles are covered with plastic cling wrap. With the plate as a cover, i feel the the cling warp is unnecessary. Is there any way we can avoid single use plastics?"
207,McQueen2014,1,"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and have just undergone 2 operations and am due to start chemotherapy shortly. I booked a family holiday to Vietnam for me, my husband and daughters before this unexpected news. I asked Vietnam Airlines if they could waiver the £150.00 per person cancellation charge as we need to cancel the flights leaving on 22/6/19. I spent a whole month waiting for replies from my many emails to customer service asking to answer my request and have been  shoved from pillar to post - everyone passing the buck, but no-one answering my question. And, along the way there have been lots of empty promises to call me to assist me with this matter, but no-one ever called. Finally, after all that i called and got to speak to someone in customer services who gave me a flat No! response saying as it was against company policy to waiver anything. It saddens me that this waste of time was so unnecessary and the way I have been treated makes it all so more horrible and unkind. I will not be book again with this airline."
207,Luxury Traveller,1,They changed our flight schedule from 18:05 to 15:30 ten days before our flight. Which put us in a very difficult position since we had planned everything according to our flight times. They reimbursed the flight ticket fee and we had to buy from another airline at much more expensive price and plus pay for a private transfer because of the flight time change.
208,Michael v,4,"Flew from FRA to HAN on the VN36 flight. Had not flown with Vietnam Airlines before, so did not know what to expect. Was absolutely fine. Are member of the Skyteam alliance, so checked in via KLM app. Efficient boarding, departed and arrived on time, luggage arrived. Modern plane (Boeing 787 Dreamliner), very smooth flight. I was in economy, which was at par with what you would get from KLM or other European airline. Good in-flight entertainment. Food was neither good, just airplane food. All in all a good flight. Would fly with them again."
208,Vicky S,5,All good.  A drink only as a short flight but the crew did all their proper security checks etc so safety was taken seriously.
208,Robbo44Melbourne,4,Had good flights to and from Nha Trang. Short flights so there was no food just a bottle of water which was fine. Quick efficient check in and baggage delivery
208,DEBORAH O,5,We had a couple of domestic flights and one international flight and all flights provided a very good service with no difficulties at all. Staff were friendly and helpful and seats were comfortable.
208,Chris Barringer,5,"My wife and I decided to splurge a bit for for anniversary trip and were not disappointed at all!  The seating was spacious, food excellent, drinks and wine were delicious ans the staff were impeccable.  Our flight was delayed by an hour or so out of Sydney and we (nor the check-in staff) thought that we would make our connecting flight in Ho Chi Minh to Hue.  Obviously they called ahead and there was airline staff were waiting for us at the gate, rushed us through customs &amp; immigration, collected our bags, ran us over to the Domestic terminal, had boarding passes waiting for us at Check-in, and we made our flight with about 8 minutes to spare.  I don't know if we would have gotten the same attention if we were flying Economy."
209,Yokimmy,1,I have spent the last two days on the Vietnam Airlines website and call centers to try and book my families flights from Hong Kong to Vietnam with no success and a lot of frustration.<br>After spending an hour inputting the personal information for 6 family members as well as my credit card to purchase the tickets the website told me that something went wrong and to come back later. After calling the customer support (in Vietnam as well as Canada) I got no help. <br>I tried again today to go on the site and still the same thing. I called again and again with no help. Just one rep after another telling me to call a different number. <br>Never again! I'll take my business elsewhere.
209,wayne b,3,"Our original flight was cancelled by the airline, no reason given! We took 6 flights with this airline during our holiday. The food was ok, the staff friendly. None of our flights took off on time, the worse being over an hour late. The most shocking thing, on the internal flights, during take off and landing, the cabin staff did not check the cabin and young children around us were not belted in, were standing up and moving around as we came into land! This happened on all the internal flights. We upgraded to premium and had plenty of leg room, but not sure I would use again"
209,TheDaddyP1967,4,"Good flight checked in quickly both ways, refreshments on the plane were fine. Cheap ticket. Would book again without hesitation"
209,IanPlatt,5,"The service on the aircraft could not have been better.  Friendly crew, good variety of entertainment on the screen and good food with plenty of it.  <br>Did take some extra snacks, but ate only a little of it.<br>Buy any snacks from supermarket before going to the airport, duty free is a rip-off.  The prices without tax is often twice what you pay in Coles.<br>We’re only short, economy had sufficient leg room for us.  Taller people may still find leg room a little insufficient.<br>Vietnam Airlines is as good as any other we have travelled."
209,pynemop,4,"Pleasantly surprised with the airline, staff as good as could be, handling local travelers, <br>e.g allowing children to run around when plane landing.<br>No food consumed on board"
210,Kathy R,4,"Great flight. Quite a bit of leg room, the staff were friendly and attentive and the food was good. The toilets were kept clean which was most appreciated!"
210,Rachel L,3,"It was my 1st time take Vietnam Airline, only two things I am a bit annoy are : 1) Flight was delay ( I was like running all the way to catch the other flight). 2. their announcement system not very clear. But the food on board is very good!"
210,Tamsyn L,5,"The plane was on time, boarding went smoothly and received free refreshments on board. Comfortable and worth our money."
210,Martin H,3,Warm drinks and a poor menu leaves a bitter tatste in the mouth. A great clean new fleet of aircraft unfortunately didnt tip the balance as the whole flight felt like a cheap budget airline lacking in  customer service. The most disturbing thing was that the safety demonstration was played via the video screen with very little crew interaction and while there were screaming kids jumping up and down while this was playing not only the parents didnt seem to care neither did the cabin crew.  Thats disturbing.
210,Gramoore10,5,"This was the return leg of my flight from Bangkok to Hanoi. From the online booking, check-in and the in-flight experience, this was seamless. This is a full-service airline and the price for the return flight was very reasonable. When I inquired in check-in at Hanoi if there were seats available with extra leg room, I was immediately given a window seat in the first row of economy. Perfect, in the seating configuration for this aircraft (A321).<br>Staff all friendly, helpful and attentive. I would happily fly with this airline again."
211,Fulvia H,4,"the flights there were great, friendly and very efficient. nice food. i was a bit concerned about the overuse of plastic, there is no need for it and they should reconsider their packaging. every individual item is packed in plastic... the return flights were a bit muddled up, we had to have 3 stops -camh ranh to hanoi to ho chi minh to Sydney and not much time in between so a lot of running to catch the next flight and stressful waiting to get through customs due to long lines and a lot of vietnamese people just push in front of you. . I asked them to cut out the Hanoi flight and go direct to Ho chi minh but they wanted to charge $200 AUD ea and were a bit rude about it so we just kept what we had. Overall the flights were on time, the food was nice and hostesses were friendly"
211,John E,5,"Vietnam Airlines is ""best of class"" in Vietnam using latest aircraft. The service is excellent. The plane was very new and also very clean. There were in flight magazines showing regional sites. The flight was on time and arrived on time. Recommended."
211,tysontrip,3,"We arrived at Phu Quoc Airport to be advised that the flight is 2 hours delayed. We have a connecting flight with VN from HCMC to Sydney that would depart minutes after the flight arrived. There was not a care taken, no instructions on what to do if we missed this flight. Nothing. Instead we were advised that if you have a complaint to tell them in HCMC. Great we can't really complain when we would be running for our lives to catch that plane. Our alternate was to stay in HCMC and organise ourselves another flight. But the dude at Phu Quoc wasn't going to help with that. On the flight we explained our issue to the attendant and there were a few people in the same boat so to speak. On arrival we were met with a grounds person who gave us instructions to collect our bags. As a team we ran thru the terminal following her; jumped the check in queue, checked our bags and ran onto the flight before they closed the doors. The flight was thankfully delayed to help us catch it. But it was a very nervous 3 hours without a clue of what was going to happen and if we would make it!"
211,Gerrod S,4,"The trip was on time and went as expected. We had no issues checking in and in fact, it took very little time. The cabin crew was nice and respectful and we arrived at our destination on time."
211,bbur970019,3,"This is a relatively short flight and they manage to squeeze in a full meal service.  The choice is chicken or fish and the same meal going to or returning from Hanoi.  Totally forgettable food but the staff was nice, the flight was on time and we made it safely."
212,mikeives2017,5,"Dedicated check in with very helpful staff. Lounge shared but OK average food reasonable drinks.<br>On board service excellent, great staff who could not do enough to make the trip a great experience. Good food and whilst a small selection wines and other drinks top quality.<br>6 hour stop over  in Ho Chee Min with a hotel provided. We stayed in the lounge which was a mistake. Average food but good drinks selection. Hotel next time.<br>Next leg to Heathrow another great experience. Cabinn crew first class, every attention to detail. Great laydown flat beds in modern very clean Dreamliner. <br>In summary a great exoerience at a fraction of Qantas, Emerates etc fares.<br>Recommend the experience to all?"
212,Trevor S,5,"Left Melbourne to HCM City. Staff are busy and easy to get drinks from.  Full service airline so very happy to be treated well. Flew onto Siem Reap, later to Hanoi and then south to Phu Quoc Island. In total 6 flights this trip all with Vietnam Airlines.. Our 3rd trip and will continue to use. Returning satisfied customers."
212,Lookslikerain,3,"Well, they took me to HCMC and brought me back. Apart from that the flight was totally forgetful (which is probably a good thing). One tip, when you leave HCMC airport turn left to the taxi rank Don't go near the white private cars outside the main entrance. If you do, photo the number plate of the car and the driver-you'll need it as evidence for the police as they're all crooks."
212,Faye Roberts,5,Really wanted to write a review as we flew with Vietnam Airlines multiple times when we stayed in Vietnam for over two weeks. We had a great experience with the airline with helpful and friendly staff and the flights were all on time (bar one that was only 15 minutes late). They were very efficient checking people in and filling the planes. Would recommend.
212,zuthee,3,"took short trip from Hanoi to BKK. Service from a steward was not impressive. in fact, a bit aggressive. cabin and seat was just fine."
213,Hanh Van Pham,5,"Although it is an only two hour flight, Vietnam Airlines offers a jumbo aircraft with excellent In-flight services. Tasty dinner was served, in-flight entertainment available on nearly the whole flight. Legroom was great as usual, and most importantly, flights are always on time despite over-capacity demand on SGN airport.<br>The Titanium Lotusmiles (or SkyTeam Elite) gives 10 extra kgs as well as priority check-in, boarding and baggage claiming, which is also very helpful.<br>Definitely the best choice for all domestic flights."
213,Great experiences,4,Comfortable flight.  Many empty seats so lots of room.  Food not too bad usually not too good.<br>Amenties need to be cleaned more frequently. <br>Baggage came off promptly.
213,Ianfung,3,Typical airline food but the pork was surprisingly tasty. Service can be better: ask for a large glass of white wine and stewardess came back with half a glass of white wine at room temperature...
213,Bob C,4,"Flew syd-saig, saig da nang, da nang hanoi, hanoi syd.<br>All with vietnam airlines. New planes, all clean, service and staff all good.<br>Checkin at Sydney took an hour. Checkin at Saigon domestic took so long we missed the plane, however they put us on the next one without drama."
213,Tanya K,3,"No frills, no inflight service, got me to my destination. Weather restricted early arrival. Landing was a bit rough. Check in very adequate and no problems"
214,GlobeTrottingDiva,4,"The flight service and overall experience was great.  Even thought the flight was under 3 hours, there was a full meal service.  The flight attendants were friendly and helpful and the ride smooth.  Great value for the money."
214,David T,1,"In one week 3 flights - Hanoi to Danang, Danang to Ho Chi Minh, and Ho Chi Minh to Siem Reap - not one flight on time.  Last flight was booked on flight VN813 to depart at 1620 25 May to attend planned dinner in Siem Reap - advised after arrival in Vietnam on 15 May we had been changed to VN815 departing at 1920 blowing our plans.  No explanation from airline and when called, unable to provide assistance even though another flight at 1720hrs.  At the airport, they  wanted to charge for luggage 2 kg overweight due to concerns over excess weight on plane - got on plane and only 20% full so not sure weight was a concern.  To top this debacle off - flight departed 30 minutes late.<br>Staff at gates of all 3 flights arrogant about delays - no explanation and staff at Hanoi advised one couple who asked just to sit and accept delay.  <br>Tour guides advised this is arrogance of airline who previously had a monopoly - noticed other airlines not having similar delays and staff more courteous.<br>Look elsewhere for flight and consider Vietnam Airlines a last choice - we won’t fly them again and have advised our travel agent to reconsider using them."
214,RATING255100,5,"Travelled by day Melbourne, Australia to Da Nang, Vietnam for one week holiday. Cabin Crew were extremely courteous and friendly, flight on time and Premium economy seating very comfortable.  I would definitely choose Vietnam Airlines if travelling to Vietnam again."
214,Joanne C,3,"We Had booked 3 internal flights during our stay at vietnam as I had heard about optiontown. so I booked 3 months ahead of our visit and paid optiontown for a bid to upgrade, we also checked in early. The thing that bothers me is that you can not book you seat no. so we didn't get the upgrade on any of the flights and at check in  they seem to put non Vietnamese people at the back of the plane. On our second flight we were at the very last row with a nice view of the toilets. for our third flight i commented to my husband if we will be sitting back with the crew this time as we could get any worse than the last flight. As we checked in we were asked if we wanted the emergency exit . I dont know how they do the seat allocation but when we flew with Jetstar Pacific we picked our own seats at a small cost but it was worth it so I will be going with them from now on."
214,GrangeyM,5,"We had great in flight service, smooth flight, they were new planes including connecting flights they were very quiet with plenty of leg room, the check ins were very efficient."
215,ZZTOP,5,"I arrived at Hanoi airport close to 3 hours ahead of my departure to Singapore. Since this is my first time flying Vietnam Airlines, given that they were unable to accommodate my request for an aisle seat, I was offered a window seat on the emergency exit row. This was very welcome to me as being close to 6 foot, extra leg room is appreciated. The inflight service experience was extremely good, all in all I'd give Vietnam Airlines a rating of 10/10."
215,DaycareDi,4,"We flew Vietnam airlines to Ho Chi Minh City, then Hanoi, then Hoi An then back to Ho Chi Minh again and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and comfort."
215,Cheryl F,5,"as usual we are treated like royalty.  It is certainly worth paying the extra for business class we believe.  Flew to Ho Chi Minh and then domestic to Da Nang, we still chose business class, even for the domestic flight.  We love this airline, and the sleep on the way home to Melbourne mean we arrive feeling pretty good."
215,Dylan L,5,"If you are flying domestic in Viet nam, I would highly suggest paying a little bit extra for Vietnam Air rather than the discount Vietjet.  Vietjet as many people know is very unreliable!  Vietjet is always late (ALWAYS) and sometimes cancelled.  The seats on Vietjet are also very tight, so if you are tall the flight can be a bit cramped.  I enjoyed my flight with Viet Nam airlines very much, and it was right on time!"
215,Trudy A,4,"I recently went to hoi an in North central Vietnam which was amazing my fight on This 4 star airline was great ,the flight service was great ,staff pleasant, the Airbus was large and comfortable and clean, all the mod con's were there ,food and beverages were good, they are aligned with Qantas, the flight was just over 8hrs ,it was a comfortable smooth flight ,then we changed from the international flight ,to a domestic flight to danang next door, this was an Airbus also, it was just over an hrs flight, so only beverages were served ,but the service was good, the plane was clean, staff very pleasant, Vietnam airlines have international pilots, as well as Vietnamese pilots ,they were very informative to us ,the planes are well maintained, my only advice, would be, to make sure you allow at least 2 to 3 hrs for you connecting flights, as the custom process is old fashioned, and slow ,and you have to collect your luggage from the carousel, to be inspected, ,the queues are long and slow, the customs are very serious, and scrutinize your visas and documents intensely,we had not much time between our flight, to danang and almost missed the connection, but the Vietnamese security realized our plight, so went into action and sped up things for us Australians, they rang the captain ,who offered to wait for us , they put transfer stickers on our chests and took our luggage from us ,then they said, run next door to the domestic terminal ,we all did ,but the signage is confusing, so luckily, we had some travellers with us, that had been here before, so guided us through the confusing terminal ,we were then  put on a bus and ,driven out to the tarmac, we boarded the full plane, and took off immediately,  all a bit of a rush , but we arrived safely ,and our baggage did too ,the return flights were easier, as the baggage was allowed to go all the way to Melb, and we had longer times between flights this time ,so it was more relaxing ,l have no qualms about flying again with Vietnam airlines at all they are safe , and of a high standard and are punctual"
216,Colin D,4,"I travelled Premium Economy from Australia to Europe, stopping over in Ho Chi Minh City.  I have flown Vietnam Airlines before, but Business Class.  (I was hoping to upgrade the overnight leg using points, but this was not available when I booked, and again when I checked in.)   An added benefit of Premium Economy and Business Class is that you may book a transit tour.  This includes visa fee, accommodation (4 star hotel for B.C.), meal and mini bus/taxi travel from and to the airport.<br><br>Check in was in the priority queue.  I got a priority pass for immigration and lounge access (a/c status level in Lotusmiles frequent flyer membership).  This was the Qantas business lounge in Melbourne.  Very good.<br><br>Take off was as scheduled.  I had an aisle seat, with an empty seat beside me.  Food, drinks and service were all good.   Landing was delayed due to a storm at Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>I was met just before immigration for the transit tour.  I was taken to Tan Son Nhat Hotel.  There was no time to visit any of the tourist sights.  On 5 transit tours I have been taken to 5 different hotels.  I think all the hotels had a pool.  This is a good way to break up the long journey."
216,Craig M,5,"Much better flight than last year(May). Flight attendants were a little bit older and seemed more experienced. Well trained, spoke very good english and friendly. Aircraft appeared to be brand new, can’t recall model but had the new skybeds. Flight home (nighttime) was a pleasure. Service A1. Congrats to Vietnam Airlines, much improved from last flight."
216,ATPhan,5,"Good services but inconvenience for flight transfer as have to check out and check in again, including baggages."
216,Bluejeanboy,4,"We have flown on Vietnam airlines several times and always a good experience. <br>In about half a dozen flights they have always been on time, check in was quick and easy and seating comfortable for short haul."
216,paul_g_haywood,4,"Our group of six used this airline for a round trip from Heathrow to Hanoi, in Business Class.  The outward flight was very good and the service and food were excellent.  However, on our return leg, the staff seemed inexperienced and made many mistakes for food and drinks (eg. drinks not delivered, or late delivered, wrong food delivered).  No doubt this was simply bad luck on our part but previous reviews echo our experience.  So far, VN have a monopoly for direct UK-Vietnam flights and perhaps the lack of competition makes them less efficient.  Service apart, the 1+2+1 seat layout and good schedules make VN an attractive and economical option compared to indirect and more expensive alternatives."
217,BHL_168,4,It's a good airlines company that I took for the first time. I usually took the Cathay Pacific airlines.
217,Patricia L,2,The lounge was crowded with a poor selection of food &amp; drink. Never mind we thought it will be OK on board - after all we were flying Business Class.<br><br>What a mistake !! After a glass of tepid champagne the menu arrived and I chose fish. The salmon starter was unappetising and the sea bream main course was so overcooked as to be inedible. I sent it back and was given an open sandwich.<br><br>Breakfast was also poor. Coffee was good but for the rest er no. They very quickly ran out of the western food - an omelette surrounded by a load of mush and offered noodles instead. For a flight to London where the great majority of passengers were westerners this was rubbish.<br><br>It also did not help that the cabin staff had a poor understanding of English.
217,Adrien_Hugon,1,"many of my flight have been changed, with some planned and unplanned delays. I miss one tour that i have planned because my plane can't arrive as scheduled.<br><br>i am too desapointed with this company."
217,Profbob,4,"Service Excellent. Language difficulties minimal. Planes, modern Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 well maintained and clean.<br>Business Seats  were the angled lay flat pod type which are only fair in the lay flat position for larger western people as they are a bit narrow. Food is good with an Asian touch and the cabin service as good as it gets. Lots of current in flight entertainment. <br>For all passengers with restricted mobility their are issues with any flights from all airlines into our out of Vietnam. Aero Bridges are often not functional so steps, lots of steps and stand off gates. The Business Class get their own mini bus but the 2 access steps have high risers. My wife is short and  has two knee replacements. She struggled at times but managed. Economy gets the bigger drop floor busses which are easier but are often standing room when full. <br>Ground Staff are much more helpful than in the West and will always help a struggling passenger as do fellow Vietnamese passengers. The Vietnamese public are among the friendliest and most helpful people you find anywhere in your travels."
217,Tung N,5,"Wonderfull experience with the trip. Ngoc Phuong , our flight attendant,is very attentive and professional. She is very detailed and provides exceptional care to her clients. She is cheerful and willing to go the distance to satisfy her customer needs. She is always pay attention and tries to accommodate us to the highest level as possible.  Food and drink are delicious. Her cheerful smile and  excellent service make our trip an unforgettable experience. She deserves 6 out of 5 stars for her service."
218,HanseySydney,5,"Vietnam Airlines Business Class is amazing. The food is excellent, service is outstanding, Entertainment is great with latest movies. <br>The menu is fantastic, the service is excellent.<br>I would highly recommend Vietnam Airlines Business Class."
218,Andyuk61,5,Our flight was great <br>Easy check in friendly staff <br>Comfortable seats on the 777 Dreamliner<br>For a 12 he flight it went very quickly<br>The staff were friendly and the food ok <br>For an airline
218,Jhoice,4,"I flew from Hongkong to Hanoi with Vietnam Airlines. It took a while to know the boarding gate but after patiently waiting for almost an hour and a half they finally decided which gate we were boarding from. Overall, smooth check in process. Flight attendants were nice and we were served a full meal although it was just a 2 and half hour flight. Comfortable seats and reasonable fares. Customer service is very responsive too."
218,Prokit Traveller,4,"When we took this airlines from Da Nang to Ho chi Minh, We have a very short transit time in Ho chi minh to catch up our connecting Sq flight to Jakarta. However the Vietnam Airline ground staff has helped to bring us to reach the international departure hall in faster way. we appreciate their service very much"
218,debbief517,5,"No complaints using this airline.  Flights were on time, comfortable( although, it was only a short 1 1/2 hour flight), very pleasant staff.  Seemed very efficient.   Would fly this airline again without hesitation."
219,Unelma333,3,"My review is based on two domestic and two long haul flights (Frankfurt - Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi - Frankfurt, HCMC - Da Nang, Hue - Hanoi). The flights were around 3 stars on average, but not better than that. Two cabins were old and run-down. The control system for the lights and on-board entertainment was built in the seat, so one often ended up putting on the lights or calling the flight attendant when falling asleep or not paying attention. The last breakfast was terrible. The food should have been warm, but it was cold and I personally found the sausage and peas disgusting. Coffee was bad, too.<br>On the positive side, the flights were on time and the seats fairly comfortable. Other meals (mostly the fish) were good. The entertainment system had a nice selection of movies and music. Some flight attendants were attentive and polite, others not really.<br>All in all, it was a rather mixed experience and I will probably try to avoid this airline in future, if possible."
219,James &amp; Amanda,4,A great not fantastic carrier. Decent amount of leg room for western passengers and food is of a decent standard. Staff are friendly and helpful. About what you’d expect from this level of carrier
219,swarny001,4,First time flying with Vietnam Airlines was a good experience. <br>The service and meals on board were good even cater for  my wife as she is gluten free cabin staff great<br>Overall  would recommend Vietnam Airlines even
219,Rschagrin,4,We flew Vietnam Airline on 3 intra Vietnam flights. The flights were pleasant.<br><br>The staff was just fair.
219,rkelly2018,5,Pleasant flight service was very good staff very courteous &amp; friendly nothing to difficult for them they seemed to go that extra mile to please every one and all with a smile
220,Lionel,5,This was the first time I had flown on Vietnam airlines. I have flown with a few other airlines in the past and I was very impressed with Vietnam Airlines. I am not a short person and found the leg room in economy to be sufficient. This service was first class. I highly recommend Vietnam airlines.
220,USS1117,5,"My Flight was from Singapore to Tokyo via Hanoi. I didn't expect that the flight would be really great. I just took this flight for the reason that it was the cheapest. After the booking then I did my research about the the said airline. My first impression was what a great color for an airline, not the usual and even the interior. Not to mention the cabin crew's uniform, it was very unique. Then my flight came in and I was really shocked about the service of the cabin crew, they were SUPERB! They were smiling through out the entire flight. Secondly was the food service, cause I had to fly from Singapore to Hanoi (lay over before flying to Tokyo) it was 2 hours flight and they serve hot meal for a short flight. I was really shocked about that. After the food service, clearing and beverage service they offered tea and coffee and they were able to finish all of that in just a short flight. AMAZING! not to mention the entire cabin was clean even the toilet. Great service VIETNAM airlines. After the flight I told myself I will really book my next trip with Japan airlines."
220,ianggrist,5,"We have had the pleasure of flying business class with 4 Airlines ....Qantas,Cathay, Jetstar and VIETNAM and VIETNAM is the equal of all of these..( but we don’t really class Jetstar business class as true Business class)<br>VIETNAM offer superb service and quality of food and drinks and super comfortable shell seating, only problem we had was the first leg from DaNang to Ho Chi Minh was delayed due to a technical problem with the aircraft and after two hours delay we went looking for assistance as we had a connecting flight to catch, however once we made contact with the staff it was explained that they had been looking for us in the Golden Lotus Lounge which is the Business class lounge, however we had left there when we were initially called to catch the flight that then became held up due to the technical problem.<br>One we made our selves known we were soon shifted to a another flight with an attendant taking us all the way to the gate this flight was leaving from and escorted through the gate onto the plane.<br>Amazing service from an excellent airline, and should we fly another route that VIETNAM airlines operate on there would be no doubt that it would be them we fly with."
220,ianggrist,5,"We flew Premium  economy to Ho Chi Mihn and this was the second time we have flown this class with VIETNAM Airlines and the flight  was outstanding, with one exception which is being required to close the window shade whilst flying across central Australia in daylight hours.<br>The food and service on this flight was excellent and equally as good or better than other premium economy flights we have taken with other airlines.<br>Just a word of warning, do not fall into the trap of purchasing the full service Visa On Arrival from the Company that offers Visa on Arrival services, as you will pay a great deal of money for no return, we were promised fast track through immigration and help with our luggage when all we got was the guy taking our passports and visa forms from us and leaving us until near everybody had gone through check in, in fact we were amongst the last half dozen to go through immigration, then when we were finnsly given our stamped passport we were just pointed to the queue where we were near last in the queue, and as for help with our luggage ....forget it as we didn’t see the guy again after he handed us back our passports, so just to end this saga DO NOT USE THE FULL SERVICE / FAST TRACKING option of visa on arrival.<br>But this all had nothing to do with VIETNAM Airlines and their Premium  Economy class is world class"
220,ElaineBristol,5,"We recently took 3 flights using Vietnam airlines. 1st premium economy direct from London Heathrow to Hanoi, 2nd business class from da nang to go chi Minh and 3rd economy from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore and all 3 took off on time with excellent service and friendly staff. Check in was quick and smooth with priority bags when had upgraded flights (didn’t happen with our return flight using BA). Would definitely use again. Really comfortable flights."
221,PushExplore,4,"We flew from Hanoi to Danang on Vietnam Airlines. The plane was new and was quite neat and clean from the inside. The Flight was quite short but quite comfortable. There was a lot of rain, so there was a bit of turbulence, but besides that the experience was nice. No food served on this short flight but they did have some beverages on offer.<br><br>Check in was fairly smooth, we had Priority Tags, but the luggage took quite a while to arrive. No in-flight entertainment, which was sad."
221,tommytug,3,I arrived at Changi and check in was pleasant. <br>I was flying to Hochi mihn city and then my final destination was Taiwan. <br>Both flights where short.  I was impressed both flights where bang on departure and arrival. <br>On board entertainment is limited no tv on seats.  One movie no choice.  The lack of information during the flight ie flight path etc is non existent. The meal served was ok on both flights.  Flight crew where pleasant and very busy. <br>I would use the airline again for short hsul flights.
221,vinvin6262,5,I always flight Vietnam airline.<br>but this is first time from Ha Noi To Yangon.<br>all process check in at international airport very smooth.<br>service from all crews very friendly.<br>i love the food on Plane provided by Viet Nam airline.<br>Viet nam airline no delay like Vietjet air that why i prefer Viet Nam airline.
221,672highf,5,First time flying with Vietnam Airlines was a no fuss flying experience. Check in was efficient even though there were long lines of passengers waiting to check in three hours before departure time.<br>On board I was lucky enough to ask to change seat to an exit aisle and these was done without question. The service and meals on board were as good as any and the cabin staff very efficient. <br>The departure was on time and the arrival was early.<br>Overall a very enjoyable flight and would recommend Vietnam Airlines even if they only claim 4 star status.
221,Michael L,4,"Poor communication of gate change, our tour group of 18 was waiting at gate 5, the initial notified gate. 10 minutes before boarding I noticed a flight arrival and passengers arriving, which seemed unusual.<br><br>I needed to walk some 50 metres to a flight screen to see gate change was on the screen and advised the group. Lucky that gate was only 100m distance, better to have that advice at the original gate!"
222,phale12017,4,"Left and arrived on time. The aeroplane was a Dreamliner and l found l had adequate space for a long journey . The staff were polite and helpful and supplied us with plenty of drinks . The food was also fine but unfortunately there was not a choice when the trolley came to me! The onboard entertainment was good with a wide variety l  of films, games and programs. I particularly liked the 3D world map! I would definitely travel with this airline again."
222,Binh Chau,2,"Travelled with my colleagues on a business trip and our seats are in the same row. When we tried to place our backpack into the cabin, the cabin was fully filled with other people bags so we put it in another empty cabin. One of the flight attendants didnot let us, said I must put the backpack in the cabin above my seat then left. This was ridiculous! None of the bags in the cabin above our seats were ours! Why didn't she ask whose bag were in my cabin and tell that person to put his bag in his cabin."
222,Michael H,2,"All together we had 4 Flights with Vietnam Airlines, two were Domestic and two were International, the two Domestic were fine, the aircraft clean on time and the Cabin Crew Friendly and helpful. the two International were both delayed by over 2 hours. They were from Bangkok to Hanoi and Return. The Outward flight was delayed with no explanation that was reasonable. Our return Flight was over Ho Chi Min City and this was cancelled so we had no option but to fly via Hanoi from Hue where we had been staying with a wait in Hanoi of over 4 hours, bad enough. The flight from Hue was actually early and then began the wait. Because my Wife who is disabled required a wheel chair we checked in and were taken to the gate where there was a Cafe.<br>We only found out from the Departures Board that our Flight had been delayed and the Departure Gate changed. I checked and it was correct ( the change). I got no sense from the staff at the desk, when someone arrived. Our Flight scheduled to leave at 16.05 left just after 1800, our wait was over 6 hours, I complained to Vietnam Airlines who are still looking into it."
222,emilie150389,2,"ok for direct flight, but not expect enjoying the flight.<br>food is quite good but not enough. for breakfast, tea and coffee come after you finished your tray... drinks are served separately as well ... <br>not many choices of movies, but if you like asians movies it's ok<br>seats are average, not excellent but there are better seats in others airlines."
222,Dutchman888,5,Very smooth flight. Check in and disembarking was efficient. The air hostesses were wonderful and friendly.
223,Margo,3,"Normal flight, nothing more, nothing less. The interior of the first flight was quite deteriorated, and seats were not very comfortable. No entertainment system."
223,vilar30,2,"Major disappointment.<br>Flight purchased and scheduled was for Boeing 787 Dreanliner; instead got a very old<br>A-321 in very poor shape. Old, torn, and stained seat covers. The interior in general was beyond its prime.<br>In flight service was mediocre at best. ."
223,vilar30,3,Nothing to rave about.<br>Boarding was quite disorganized<br>Mediocre service on board. Beverage selection poor. Ice limited to one piece.
223,jo chan,1,"Booked through trip.com and had my trip changed without my consent less than 24hrs before the flight. The new flight would land as my flight home would be departing so we tried with the help of trip.com agents to resolve the issue however they were less than helpful because of our ""ticket class"" . We had to book completely new tickets in order to make our flight home."
223,Philip L,5,"Efficient check-in, efficient boarding.<br>Adequate in-flight service. But most importantly: perfectly on time."
224,steveshears,5,"The best leg room and recline I've ever had in premium economy, service excellent, food o.k but not all to the English taste"
224,Jurussomano,1,"First time flying with this company and unfortunately have more flights that I have already bought. Awful service at Vientiane airport, staff barely speak English and when I wanted to anticipate my flight to a earliest one on the same day (what many companies do for free) they wanted to charge me USD 100 and I was wiling to pay but guess what? At the airport this company doesn’t accept credit card, can you believe this? And staff at the office not much friendly"
224,Tom Green,5,"I am a frequent flyer on Vietnam airlines, at the check in desk, I recieved a free business class upgrade. The seat comfort were very good.  The staff are great. <br>Highly recommend!"
224,Aliona_Valois,3,"Not so good. I flew from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh and then back. Airplanes are old, it feels very strong while flying. Sounds of creak, screech and airplane shakes a lot. The flight was one hour and half and they gave only to drink. Only two kinds of drinks: cola and simple water. There wasnt even tea or coffee. Usually on such flights with another airlines I got a sandwitch or bisquits. Other things are well."
224,Doc,3,"We recently took 3 flights with Vietnam Airlines: 1 Hong Kong to Hanoi; 2 Hanoi to Saigon; 3 Saigon to Siem Reap. <br><br>Generally the check in processes were straightforward if a little lengthy; all the aircraft were clean and comfortable; flights were smooth and the in flight service was good. There were, however some delays. <br><br>The flight from Hong Kong was delayed for half an hour (no reason given). Hanoi to Saigon was delayed over 4 hours. I suspect this was due to the high volume of travellers at holiday time (Re-Unification Day), although no reason or prior notification was given. We only found out when we arrived at the airport. Hanoi airport was chaotic, with delayed flights and long queues everywhere. Not the place to spend 6 hours. <br><br>These things can happen at peak times, but the real problem was VA staff did not seem to be prepared. <br><br>Their strategy was to waitlist those on delayed flights for the next available flight with instructions to return about half an hour before departure. Unsurprisingly of course there were no seats available so the process was repeated again and again. <br><br>This strategy was never going to work. Even if miraculously seats were available there would have been insufficient time to check in and complete disembarkation procedures. It was really just a holding manoeuvre that added to frustration. <br><br>It would have been more helpful and appreciated to:<br>A) advise of re-scheduled flights early if at all possible to avoid travelling to the airport too early;<br>B) provide some form of meal voucher."
225,mavis d,3,very long flight not a lot of food or drinks served on this return flight unlike outward flight drinks were available all the time
225,Red Ensign,4,"Really happy. Not a big name in Airlines but all good. Seats were good . Seats on the Dreamliner were better than A350. Service was great with attentive staff. Food was nice. Flew AIR FRANCE on the return leg. Paris to Saigon . Thought food on Vietnam Airlines was nicer. Like the way that the complete tray is placed in front of you. Instead of the trolley being pushed down the isle. Seemed to be faster.  Sky priority being good with separated gates and quick processing . Business Class lounge in Saigon small but comfortable with a nice range of food, drinks and snacks."
225,Geoff Y,4,The lounge in HCMC could provide more selection of food. On the flight the cabin crew are terrific. A mattress supplied made a good difference. Can not comment on quality of food as I went to sleep but the selection was quite good. Breakfast was a bit small but again selection quite good and tasty. You really need to serve the bread at the same time as serving the cold cuts. Also milk and sugar should be on the tray and not have to be asked for.
225,kevinjleary,5,"i Travelled to vietnam in june 2018 and the girls was so friendly , the meals was not too bad , i am going to V N on the 29th of May 2019 and i have already booked with Vietnam Airlines"
225,calvinfame,4,They do none stop from HCM city to Shanghai that’s why I fly with them for !!! Service is ok not bad but can be better!!!
226,Ruben James,4,Flight delays with budget flights are norm but Vietnam airlines have given me delays almost everytime I take them. The service and food is very good. Comfort of seats is perfect. Just the delays bring this ratings low. Work on that and they be a 4 star flight like they say
226,chillo2014,4,"All flights on this carrier were very efficient and the staff were as friendly as they could be. We took flights from Hanoi, DeNang, Ho Chi Minh. Ground staff committed to giving you information. Flight attendants very friendly and polite. All planes Airbus and Boeing were clean, good service and for the short flights good space."
226,bluewasp2000,4,"Food was good, service was attentive. Personally I found the seat not as comfortable as I was expecting but I do have some mobility issues."
226,John B,2,We are flying out to Hanoi this Friday. I have just received an email with yet another change of time. This is the fourth departure time so far and it’s become frustrating. Every change means we have to change the booking for the car to rake us to the airport from our hotel. We definitely won’t fly with them again. 😟
226,"IsnEd from Newcastle, Australia",2,"I am really concerned about the amount of plastics used by this airline and furthermore, how and where it is disposed. The airline needs to address this and become role models for others in Vietnam. Plastics are ubiquitous. Litter/Garbage is ubiquitous.  All of this needs to be managed better than it is currently."
227,"IsnEd from Newcastle, Australia",3,"We flew premium economy both directions. Flight to Ho Chi Minh was very uncomfortable. The foot rest was jammed in an upright position. In addition, the seats are poorly designed; certainly not designed ergonomically with an exaggerated backwards tilt in the upright position. I used the inflight cushion to provide lumbar support. The seats do not reach a conventional upright position as in other providers. I am tall and yet could not reach the fold down foot rest nor adjust it upwards to suit the awkwardness associated with the seat position. The service was hurried; it felt like a conveyer belt experience. The hostesses were polite. The food was at best warm. I was disappointed."
227,rdk1,4,"We flew Melbourne - Hanoi, changing planes at HCMC, then Hanoi to Hue, then Danang HCMC then finally back to Melbourne.<br><br>Nice new planes, excellent service. But we found the airbridges were generally not used on landing, and we had to get onto a bus to travel to the terminal. This happened at both Hanoi &amp; HCMC. This was not fun in the heat, and particularly not when we could see plenty of empty airbridges."
227,marknM3187EP,4,"Our family of five flew from Vietnam to Melbourne on Vietnam Airlines.  The overall experience was pretty good.  This was a night flight departing at around 8:45pm.  There was a small delay in leaving, but not a major.<br><br>The airplane, a Airbus A350-900 was really nice, large but with good seats and very comfortable for long haul.<br><br>The only real complaint is that by the time the drinks and meals had been served, it was close to midnight before the cabin lights were turned off, and they were then back on again before 4:00am so that breakfast can be served.  Given the time we were leaving and the time we were arriving, I am not sure why two meals are even required - who is eating dinner at 10:30pm and breakfast at 4:30am???  Would have preferred that neither of these were served and the option was there to sleep!  This is probably nitpicking though and not really a fault of Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>The entertainment is decent, a good range of modern movies, average range of TV shows but a very small selection of english kids stuff so would recommend anyone travelling with children takes their own entertainment.<br><br>Staff were friendly and food was pretty good.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines are a step below Air NZ and Qantas but they still do a good job, and I would have no hesitation flying with them again."
227,Kenichi H,1,"先日5月3日に女房と友達夫婦でホーチミンから仁川に行くのにVN406を利用しました<br>毎回思うが、ベトナムの人はイミグレから無愛想で、仕事が雑で、効率が悪すぎる、<br>今回は時間通りに飛行機は飛びました、相変わらず機内は臭く、シートはがたがた、CAも愛想がない、この辺りは想定内で我慢出来たが、今回一番腹が立ったのは、夜の便でベトナムで、遊び疲れる飛行機で休みたかったが、なんとバックヤードで彼らは大音量で音楽を流し談笑してました、最初はなんかのBGMだと思ってましたが、明らかにおかしいので覗きに行ったらカーテンの向こうで、やはり音楽を掛けてまるでパーティーをやってるかの様に談笑してました、私がクレームを言うとようやく音楽を切りました、勿論謝罪はなし。何かアクシデントが有った時彼らは適切に対処出来るか疑問に感じました。<br>未だに信じられないし、とにかく改善して欲しい。選択肢が有れば二度と使いたくないです。<br>I ,my wife and friend’s couple flew from Ho Chi Minh bound for Incheon by VN406 <br>In 3rd May 2019.<br>This was the worst flight ever I experienced <br>First of all CA was very unfriendly from begging to end.<br>In side air craft was so stink!!<br>Seat was broken and meal was taste bad especially bread was obviously old and toilet was awful no replacement of toilet paper. <br>Most lousy things was they had a like part behind the partition at rear with big sound(music) we could not sleep!!<br>At begging I thought it was some kind of BGM but I was aware that was not so I went to complain to them!<br>Then finally then stop the music.<br>I wonder if accident occur they would cope with properly!?<br>They are not professional.<br>I swear that I am not gonna use Vietnam air line if there are choice!!"
227,Geoff Y,4,A great flight in business class with the flat beds. Not quite Qantas but then also not as expensive. Friendly staff. Great food. Very good wine. Would definitely recommend and looking forward to the leg to Frankfurt
228,surfam2012,4,our flight were from kuala lumpur to saigon then connecting saigon to danang. stewardess are helpful and friendly. food was good. only hesitate of halal meal service when we flight back from saigon to kualalumpur. affordable promotional price. really worthy and comfy enough.<br><br>thank you vietnam airlines
228,Pob-Bob,4,"Flew from Hong Kong to Luang Prabang via Hanoi. Both flights OK, with a hot meal (ok by budget standards) on the first and a chicken sandwich on the second (which was a prop plane!). We also flew a few days later to Vientiane, also a prop plane, but no snack on this flight, as quite short. Seats were ok, and staff efficient."
228,TuThanhNguyen,5,"Great experience with Vietnam Airline. On time schedule, good service, best in-flight meal.<br>The only cons is that I can not do check in online. There must be something wrong with the mobile web, even within 24 hour prior to departure date.<br>Definitely flight with Vietnam Airline in near future when in need"
228,FamilyNYorks,4,"Our outward flight left on a sunny day and we were enjoying the warmth of the sun through the windows and the clear views below. The flight departed at 11.10am but by 2.30 London time, the windows had been dimmed and we were sitting in semi-darkness! We had no control over this. Food and drink were offered as expected but the staff didn't seem happy in their work.<br>Our seats were comfortable and we had plenty of legroom. Our screens offered plenty of entertainment and it was a pleasant flight."
228,HERMAN3,5,"We had never flown this airline, as the fare was very reasonable our expectations were not very high.<br>The premium economy seat was one of the best I ever sat in almost as good as business without the lay flat.<br>The service is very good, the experience was great.<br>The meals not of the highest standard, but for the price it was good.<br>I certainly would recommend this airline"
229,Jack C,5,"We flew fri melbourne to Saigon on Vietnam Airlines business A350.<br><br>It was a treat <br><br>The seats were very comfortable, stretching to a full bed allowing us to sleep during the flight <br><br>The service was excellent and the food outstanding <br><br>Will fly this service again"
229,UlstermaninNorfolk,4,"I had a return flight LHR to HAN and a return flight HAN to REP (Siem Reap).  Overall, I was impressed.  The cabin crew were friendly and courteous.  Food was good for economy.  Good entertainment.  Check in at Hanoi was chaotic.  Return flight almost 3 hour delay.  That said, I’d use Vietnam Airlines again."
229,brett m,5,We came back from Vietnam on these guys and the service was top notch the staff we friendly and happy to serve us
229,silverelb,4,"We went to travel to Thailand 1 week and booked VN airline on Traveloka. There was a promotion for purchasing flight to Bangkok so our tickets were cheaped and good-timing compared to other brands. <br>The only minus point that I can't give 10 grade is about the meal on flight. The meal on 2 way flights were almost same, simple and cold (except bread). And in the return flight, the meal was not fresh which happened with fruit and cold cut. So I hope the sky team could look forward to solve this problem"
229,Roger C,5,What a revelation. The staff were terrific the plane quiet and comfortable. The airline provided a hotel room and all meals plus a guided tour of Ho Chi Minh City during our 12 hour or so stop over. The price was very competitive and the whole journey very satisfactory. Congratulations Vietnam
230,benjoejack,3,"on the whole not to bad , unlike other airlines the seats dont recline right back , so thats a good thing not having a seat back in your face for 12 hours . They do the usual service well enough and as you might expect offer asian dishes too . <br>i didnt use the service button to get a drink , it was quite nice to get up and go get one myself.<br>non stop to saigon was a no brainer"
230,David T,4,Having flown with the airline before in premium economy on the Dreamliner was very impressed with service and the space given <br>Had a flight on the A350 the seat configuration was 2-4-2 and it still was good.The service was still very good but you could see the seat difference to the Dreamliner but nothing to complain about <br>Our return flight was on another A350 with seat configuration 3-3-3.<br>Unfortunately it didn’t have anything on the other two planes in configuration <br>The service was fantastic but if your paying for premium economy why have seat configuration the same as economy but more comfortable seating <br>Premium economy should be about paying for more space to stretch out and enjoy the flight <br>The Dreamliner is exactly what I would pay for but the airbus lags behind <br>You still get the fantastic service on both planes and a secluded area from economy for the premium economy costs but once you traveled on both planes you will understand the difference
230,geoffza,4,"Wish I had taken the offer to upgrade the flights, both to and from Vietnam. Being over 6ft tall, economy was cramped. The online booking system only allows you to book your seats 24 hrs before the flight departs - did not get the chance to do this until later in the day, by then all the seats were fully booked and we were in the tail! Got to the airport early and luckily were able to change seats to row 19 instead of 33 - had an aisle seat so did manage to stretch the legs. Flight back though was hell. Row 18 by the window - absolutely nowhere to put my legs [already suffer with problems with lower back and knee] - so bad that i have misaligned my pelvis and now ongoing osteo sessions to put right. Not the airlines fault at all. If you are above average height would recommend upgrading to premier economy if you get the chance or looking for a seat at an emergency exit - something I wish  I had had the opportunity to do. Onboard service though was fine - meal out was decent. Meal back though, well it was neither western nor Vietnamese and did leave a lot to be desired! That is the only fault I can make against the airline. Flew with them internally, Hanoi to Hue and Hue to HCMH - no issues whatsoever apart from the online checkin. Apparently there is no online service for flights from Hue, not made aware of this until we got to the airport!"
230,tintin 69,4,"Except the business lounge , the flight was exremely good (A350 plane) with top noch service . Quality of food good . Seat-bed confortableband clean . Luggage service prompt and easy ....  best price value and perfect timeline ( night flight) ."
230,yuenry,4,"There was a severe weather condition in Hong Kong on the day of departure. Plane arrived and could not unload passengers on tarmac. Finally boarded plane 1.5 hours later, then another one hour before takeoff because there were 30 planes in front of ours.  Once airborne, the service was good and the food served was delicious. Much better than Cathay pacific. Deplaning in HCM,  the business class passengers were bused to the terminal first before economy passengers. Excellent arrangement. Will definitely travel on Vietnam Airlines again."
232,captaindashing,1,"Delays are common with airlines. The issue I have is the last minute reschedule to my flight by 5 hours. This great affected my travel plans on the day in questioned. Apparently, this was because of changing from winter to summer schedule. The tickets were purchased about 1 month before travel. How can this airline not have adequate planning?"
232,redemigrant,2,"My wife and I flew from Sydney to London via Hanoi (on VN786 and VN55), paying a Premium Economy fare. The fare is cheaper than our other options, and was recommended by our agent based on feedback from her other clients.<br><br>The good news? Bigger seats than economy (2,3,2 formation in a 787), priority baggage and boarding (at least when checking in at Sydney, by Qantas staff).<br><br>The bad? The entertainment system on our side of the cabin didn't work at all on the Sydney -Hanoi leg, and not without intermittent issues (freezing completely,  or skipping forward) on the Hanoi - Heathrow sector - we were glad to have loaded books and songs onto our G-pads before boarding the 9 hour flight! The food was generally ok (marginally better than economy is, typically),  but they ran out of, or otherwise did not have one of the two breakfast options prior to reaching London, and served up a luke warm meal on the hanoi leg. The experience was inconsistent - we got priority boarding at Sydney, but not at Hanoi; the cutlery was plastic on the first leg, and steel on the second; and we were told by the check-in staff at Sydney that we could use the lounge, but refused at the lounge (along with a number of othe 'Premium') travellers.<br><br>Overall, if you are prepared to pay the extra for the bigger seat, and (sometimes) priority treatment, then Vietnam Airlines is ok. If you want a real 'premium' experience, maybe look elsewhere, though it will cost more. You get what you pay for, I guess."
232,GenoMichiganYooper,3,"Nice flight, easy check in, not a lot of perks, but also not a lot of cost to fly.<br><br>Seats were OK, the same as most discount airlines around the world.<br><br>Friendly staff, easy seat changes at check in counter, friendly flight staff, no issues, luggage made the flight.<br><br>Supposed to be part of FF program with Delta, Skyteam Alliance, we submitted our boarding passes for points when we got home...no go...somehow...the cheaper tickets would not give us frequent flyer points.<br><br>Mahalo"
232,TH LOW,3,"The airlines was ok, but the plane and its interiors are pretty old. Lots of cracking noice when plane is taking off and landing :-)"
232,Jamsoncoke,4,"Good flight, check in was very quick.<br>Paid for a mid level flex ticket to ensure my check in bag kgs were OK.<br>Requested &amp; received an aisle seat.<br>Inflight snack service efficient."
233,456xavierv,5,Just as Thaï Airways. A very good company for such long flights. I will definitively go with them again.
233,MFWONDERS,4,I used Vietnam Airlines 4 times during my latest trip to Vietnam with my friends of 9 people. we didn't face any issues of delays or missing bags and the crafts were good enough. prices are very reasonable as well. One main positive point is the seat is very very comfortable compared to other international airlines like Etihad Airways.
233,Sam J,5,"We flew with this airline twice on our Vietnam/Cambodia trip, we also flew with Cambodia Air which was a code share flight with Vietnam Airlines.  I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive with both airlines but I needn't have been.  All three flights were excellent, the check in was excellent whether it was Saigon, Siem Reap or Da Nang all three airports were very good.  Special mention has to be made of the team at Cambodia Air but see my review of them separately.  The Vietnam Arline's aircraft were very clean, modern and comfortable.  All in all my experience of this airline was positive and I'd fly them to any destination in Asia over Australian carriers, especially Jetstar."
233,oscarJ5945XG,5,"From check in to getting the bags in Hue, everything was ok. Better alternative than getting the train to Hue."
233,petejaus,4,"Flew with Vietnam between Seoul and HCM then onto KL and was pleasantly surprised. Both the 350 and 321 we flew on had a tonne of leg room and comfortable seats. The crew on board were fantastic and friendly, food was palatable but not up with the best I have had. Check in took forever and wasn’t a great start. Neither flights left on time, but this appeared to be the norm for Vietnam’s flights at both airports. All up a solid full service airline."
234,Alex M,4,"Priced accordingly, our business class flight was very good. Yes the likes of Qantas, Emirates, Singapore Airlines are better, however this is an excellent business class option without the price tag. Furthermore this is enhanced as they fly the newer 787 Dreamliner on this route, of which makes all the difference. I was disappointed however with the business class domestically, they were short flights so not a big deal."
234,Clare K,4,Our travel around Vietnam/Cambodia was very comfortable with Vietnam Airlines. Very professional and helpful service provided by staff. Meals were tasty and arrived hot. Toilets cleaned regularly. We had 3 internal flights plus our return flights in and out of the country. All flights were on time and buses were provided from the plane to the terminal. I would definitely fly with them again.
234,Steve H,4,"I arranged to take flights from Ho Chi Minh City - Hue and Hanoi all on Vietnam Airlines over a 2 week period.  Researching prior to purchasing the economy class tickets, I saw a significant number of reviews which led me to believe I might be in for something less than positive experiences while flying on Vietnam Airlines.  I worried for nothing.  All flights departed and arrived on time, the aircraft were clean, crews were professional and the overall experience was more than satisfactory.  So I did all that worrying for nothing.  Only comment I would have is that I wasn't able to pre-select my seats.  Would I fly Vietnam Airlines again?  Absolutely."
234,Sau Man L,1,"Very bad, rude and unhelpful ground staff! The original boarding is gate 20. When I arrived at gate 20 and the destination is not HK so I ask the ground staff for help but the first one rudely ignored me and the second one ask me to go gate 25. When I arrived gate 25, 10minuted before boarding time, the destination is to Siem reap! I asked again the ground staff and they told me they don't know the boarding gate!!! They said according to my boarding pass it's gate 25!!! But the fight number is not the same!!They ask me to check by myself!! It's really and and unhelpful!!!"
234,Billee58,5,Very professional good service and food. We also had 5 internal flights with them which were good and pretty much on time. They changed 1 flight to a time that did not suit but a phone call sorted that out. Would fly with them again
235,Hengistbury,2,"Our flight out to Ho Chi Minh City was a pre-booked package holiday including premium economy on a Boeing 787 which was extremely comfortable with first class service. However, 24 hours before our scheduled return flight home from Hanoi, we were notified that due to a change of aircraft, we had been reallocated to economy for the 12+hour journey. We later realised that the 787 aircraft was reconfigured to seat only business and economy class. The meals on the return flight did not include a ""western food menu"" and was particularly disappointing at breakfast time. This incident has put a lack of trust in the airline so wouldn't fly with them again."
235,Michael B,1,"We made a mistake and missed our flight from London to HCM city and we realize 1 hour before the departure. We called them and they said that there is nothing that they could do and that we have to call our agency. We assume our mistake and bought another ticket to HCM city thinking that we would be able to use all the rest of the tickets we paid for but they cancelled all of them because we missed the first one. They really did not care. It is so illogical, it is like if you pay in a bakery for 2 breads because there is promotion but after you pay you realize that you just want one and leave the other bread aside (even you paid for it) and the staff of the bakery comes and take the bread that you want to take home because it is both or nothing."
235,Kathleen B,5,We booked through Traveldream a package holiday and it included return flight from Sydney to Vietnam and 2 internal flights.  We were very hesitant and had no expectations the service was exceptional and the food was also in line with our Australian airline quality.  The flight was very pleasant and we would recommend to all looking forward to our flight home to Australia in a few days.  Thank you for looking after us.
235,OmniaKatoomba,5,I have been going to Vietnam for 20 yrs now and my last trip was a very good and comfortable flight with Vietnam airlines. I am flying with them again tomorrow to Hanoi then onto the UK.
235,WarrenChew,1,"Travelled on VN920 Hanoi to Phnom Penh. 20 Apr. The flight had practically no AC switched on right from boarding to disembarkation. <br>Attendants assured us when we were up in the air, it would become cooler. It didn't.  <br>It was suffocating.! There were no action taken by the crew members to relieve the situation.<br>Children were crying. <br>This was definitely a health violation issue.<br>At disembarkation in Phnom Penh, crew members were shouting for passengers to show their tickets which was both necessary and rude since it is not a regulation.<br>If I can help it that would be my last VN flight."
236,jodragon,3,Unfortunately for such a short flight approx 40 minutes we were 40 miuntes later which I found annoying for a major airline. Apart from that good quality aircraft and free drink during the journey. Staff pleasant enough.
236,GillMargo,4,"Vietnam Airlines classify themselves as a four star airline and I think this is a fair rating.  The beds in business class were not the most comfy we’ve had but comfortable enough.  Food wasn’t the best but service was good, especially from one girl Hai Oanh, she really is a credit to Vietnam Airlines as she was so lovely and friendly.  I would fly Vietnam airlines again."
236,Michael C,4,Left on time and arrived early. Good experience overall. Good value for money for an economy ticket. Had been recommended by a friend as being a reliable airline compared to others operating in Vietnam and Cambodia - lived up to this.
236,Louise B,2,"The flight was delayed by 30-40 mins and everything felt rushed after that.<br>Boarding - farcical!! Passengers  boarded from bus from both front and back doors. All good except seat numbers were not checked so people from back were trying to get to front and vice versa. A crazy chaotic and embarrassing scene!<br>Then I guess this inefficient method of filling the plane made us even later so then ensued a hair raising flight, like the pilot was rushing home for dinner.<br>Only water and Coca cola offered.<br>No cabin check prior to the scary fast sweaty palm bumpy landing.<br>Haven't flown other domestic carriers in Vietnam so can't compare. Just glad that was our only flight!"
236,Mandrake30,4,"Friendly service, good entertainment system. Food fine. Though seafood noodles for breakfast is probably an acquired taste. Price was good for premium economy and worth doing to avoid cattle class. that said, for the the daytime outbound flight the latter was absolutely fine. Alcoholic drinks on tap if needs be. I would definitely travel with this airline again."
237,jeffchia88,5,"I did a return trip from Singapore to Hue and DaNang Back to Singapore. The Service agents in Vietnam were very friendly and helpful and put me on a priority queue as I had problems with my leg. However, the Customer Service agent in Singapore were out to make money. The insisted that I pay $50 for a name change as the ticket had only captured my Christian Name. I had explained that I never had any issue using only my Christian name and surname using all would would not be possible due to space constrain. The agent was a trainee from Taiwan and supervisor I suspect must be a foreign talent from India being unaware that we use Christian names and Surname and Ethnic name. I am surprised at them being so stringent as a passenger's name is not unique as two passengers can have the same name. If the airline is to be so strict then reference to the passport number would be the most unique. I regret that the Customer Service at one of the top airports in the world would spoil my joy for looking forward to my holiday. Anyway I ended up signing a waiver of Responsibility the reason for which is not even documented in the form.  I had booked my ticket via Expedia which was not very helpful when I contacted the help desk.  Well, fortunately there were more intelligent agents and supervisors in Vietnam who did not find the name an issue as it was in my passport. Fortunately, the service on board was excellent and I had an excellent flight."
237,cam a,4,A very good experience. The flight was enjoyable and the staff were friendly end efficient. no issues with this airline at all.
237,ChrisandSueDopson,5,"Great little airline. Staff are friendly. This particular flight, we had the best landing we have ever had. Did not even realize we had touched down. Would definitely fly with them again."
237,mutednotes,5,"In flight food comes with your airline ticket. Really polite staff and clean airlines. Direct flights to Vietnam. If you are taking it from Noi Bai International airport, remember to check in online! The queues there are crazy."
237,RenTineea,5,"We used Vietnam airlines for a flight from BKK to Hanoi (round trip). Initially, I did make a mistake and booked a later flight, and was surprised to find that I needed to email them to make a change and pay the change fee instead of calling them. I was concerned they wouldn’t get back to me, but they did and everything was fine in terms of emailing our new itinerary. They sent an email for online check in for the BKK flight, and I did that with no problem. We had bags to check at BKK and that was fine. The flight was quick (1.5 hours) and smooth and wasn’t full so that was nice. They served a full meal, coffee and tea and also played relaxing music on both flights. The flight attendants were lovely. The pilots didn’t really communicate to us, which was a different experience for me, but maybe that’s just how they do things. I would fly with them again."
238,Robert N,3,"I traveled with my family over Easter.<br>Good Things: Price. Vietnam Airlines is very competitive. The food served on the airline in my opinion was better than all other airlines that I have traveled on. Staff were helpful , tolerant and polite. <br>Annoying Things: The website is very confusing and communication is not good. We got our flight times and almost missed our first flight as we hadn't checked (our fault) but the times had changed and the website is difficult to use. The staff they had were good but they didn't go around the plane very often. Thus if you needed a drink you had to go and find them. I was also concerned with the lack of enforcement by staff of the seatbelt signs, even though they did a good job of dealing with a very unruly group of thirty, lack of communication from the pilot on the way to Vietnam was annoying."
238,Posh Ollie,3,"OK - so we flew from Phu Quoc to Singapore via Ho Chi Minh City. The first thing to say when checking in at Phu Quoc is that you cant be checked in all the way through to your final destination when there is a domestic leg and then an international leg. This meant that when we arrived at Ho Chi Minh, we had to disembark, collect our luggage and transfer from the domestic terminal to the international terminal to check-in for our flight to Singapore. I found this bizarre! Anyway the check-in and boarding process (for both legs) was very easy, however the aircraft (for both legs) was a very (old) A321 (different aircraft) where the interior of the cabin was very worn and drab. The seats are not the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced and the leg room was good, however there was no inflight entertainment for 40min flight to Ho Chi Minh or the 2hr 05min flight to Singapore. No meal service was provided on the first leg (not surprising considering the length of the flight) however we were served with lunch on the flight to Singapore - the choice of chicken &amp; rice or fish &amp; noddle's. By the time they reached me, there was no more chicken so I had the fish which to be honest was pretty tasty and exceeded my expectations. A full bar service also followed so was able to enjoy a beer with my meal. The cabin crew on both flights were extremely friendly, polite and professional. I find Vietnam Airlines very competitively priced and for the route that I took, there were not many alternatives. Overall two very satisfactory flights."
238,Posh Ollie,3,"OK - first things first, we flew domestically in Vietnam and not Internationally. Check-In and boarding was very smooth and easy. The plane was an (old) A321 and to be honest had seen better days. The seats were not the most uncomfortable that I have ever experienced on an airline, but were well worn and again had seen better days! The flight was 1hr 50min and we were served with a snack which was terrible as well as drinks. As it was a domestic flight there was no inflight entertainment which when flying with children makes the flight more challenging. However the staff were extremely friendly and professional. Vietnam Airlines are not the worse airline in the world and if you are travelling within Vietnam and don't want to fly on a budget airline, they are probably the best  you can get. Plus for the route that I took, I think they were very competitively priced plus as a member of SkyTeam, you earn points!! Overall they were satisfactory."
238,MaxMaya,3,"My frequent flights to Vietnam have been mainly on Vietnam Airlines. Both on international and domestic flights. My travels are for both business and leisure. <br><br>Being base in Singapore, I have always welcome the services of the Vietnam Airlines check-in counters at Changi Airport. The counter ladies are a delight to see and be served. However, one irk that I have at the check-in counters are the Vietnamese passengers - they don't know the word 'Q'. They tend to cut Qs and when approached but other passengers in the Q, they act as though nothing has happened. I have witnessed and have action on these passengers with the staff that walks around the counters. But somehow the staff, I assume are supervisors that work for Vietnam Airlines, does not even give a damn and allow such Q cutting. A real disappointment.<br><br>The cabin of the plane is old and tired but still comfortable. However, the flight attendants uniforms are really old and some are stained. Some of the flight attendants (and on many flights) needs to keep their mouth and body odor in check. It is very unpleasant.<br><br>The flight attendants needs to help those that are aged or too short to put their cabin luggage on the over head compartment. All they do is stand and stare with no smile. Some don't even greet you when you walk down the aisles. <br><br>At the rear of the last few seats, I sometimes encounter flight attendants luggage being placed on the seats or blocking the toilet entrance. And these luggage would still be there upon take off and landing. Or the seats are filled with plastic bags of blankets. Isn't this a safety hazard?<br><br>Connecting the flights from city to city within Vietnam, the Vietnam Airlines must improved on their counter services. I rate a 1 out of 10. The staff seems so miserable to serve. Sad."
238,Kate T,4,"We flew both ways with Vietnam Airlines. Flight was smooth, food was good, legroom was decent, in-fight entertainment was excellent. They used to have gift pack for kids but not anymore."
239,phil v,5,Great airline very efficient and friendly even the airport staff from cleaners to check in staff very helpful and cheerful. The whole experience was pleasant I would certainly recommend this airline.
239,Madamdragon,5,"Fabulous seating, great movies, good food lots of choice. Would have liked more drinks. <br>Efficient staff very friendly. Quite hot asked fir air con to be turned up, instantly better. <br>Wonderful flight and very comfortable."
239,Jim M,5,"My wife and I arrived in Tokyo without boarding passes because we flew in on a different airline from the US.  Didn't know if we'd even have seats.  Got to the desk after a long haul through the airport and it wasn't even open yet.  An hour or so before the flight it opened and our fears were put to rest.  We had good seats together and were treated politely at the desk.  The flight was on time, the plane was spic and span, and all the attendants were great.  The seat size was reasonable for economy and we enjoyed the flight."
239,chuckymustdie,4,"From AU, Vietnam Airlines are one of the more inexpensive ways to go. Wish I could afford Business class but I can’t so Economy class it is. At the end of the day, no matter who you go with, it’s still a pain in the butt flying. It still takes the same amount of time and let’s face it, airline food is airline food. I sorta laugh at reviews from people flying economy and saying the food is “delicious”. <br>Two things I will say, we always get email notifications to any changes in the flight plan. Also, on the one occasion out flight was delayed 8 hours at the last minute, they bussed us all from the airport to a nice hotel, issued us all a room to use for the day, and fed us an excellent banquet lunch. We called it the best cancellation ever as it forced us to chill by the pool for a few hours and the delay, fortunately, didn’t impact our travel plans severely.<br>We’ve flown to Vietnam twice with this airline and probably will again."
239,cado_travels,3,We booked this airline due to a sale which drastically reduced the ticket cost. The luggage allowance is generous and the seats were a little more spacious than I expected. <br>The main concern is that our flight times kept changing. Our originally short layover of 1.5hrs extended to 5hrs by the time of boarding. This was super annoying as we had booked the times that had the least gaps. <br>The website is impossible to navigate if you want to select your seat or upgrade your booking. I spent some time attempting to do this and in the end I had to email them to complete it for me. <br>The customer service is brilliant via email and very speedy. The flight crew on board did their job. <br>Overall- if you’re happy to be extremely flexible with your flight times and don’t expect service beyond ok then this may just be for you. It was good but not great.
240,karen m,3,"It was the first time we had taken a long haul flight so didn't really know what to expect. The seating arrangement was in 3 rows of 3. Premium Economy was at the front of the craft. The seats were slightly wider with a little more legroom and there was also a leg support attached to the seat. We traveled in economy and it was more comfy then a package holiday flight but not as good as I expected. The service included a small pillow,blanket , slippers and earphones so you don't need to bring these with you as I found all the extra stuff cramped up my space a bit. The food was nice and you can also ask for sandwiches or noodles whenever you wish. I found the flight long but you do have your own TV and monitor which has a large selection of movies or music to help keep you entertained. We noticed that the back section of the plane was not full and quite a lot of people were switched on enough to move to the back before take off this securing themselves 3 seats to lie across..if travelling again I would book seats nearer the back and be quicker at moving into the empty seats.On arrival  We had no problems with luggage being internally moved to another aircraft for our flight to Cambodia. I would use this airline again if lucky enough to undertake another tour of Vietnam"
240,TomW59,1,Our flight times were changed without giving us a reason.  Flights were not cancelled<br><br>we were just bumped off.  Glad we found out now as we have to book 4 more flights <br><br>within Vietnam for 4 people in January/20.  Will not use this airline again!
240,mike s,5,flew international to and from the uk to vietnam plus internal flights and found the airline to be an excellent provider.
240,M.C.Rose,4,"Many Vietnam Airlines  flights were delayed when we were at Da Nang to fly to HCM city. They put priority on our luggage as we had to go from T1 to T2 (10 min walk with heavy cases) to pick up the connecting flight. Immigration queue was horrendous, we had to jump the queue to make our flight!! We had 2:30hr for connection but even though flight arrived was more or less on time we nearly missed flight to Dubai. Very stressful. If you fly via HCM city allow plenty of extra time. Only a drink (limited choice) offered on the Da Nang to HCM city leg."
240,rk-art,4,"Check in counter staff was friendly, not busy and efficient. I request to have a window seat and they can accommodate which is great. The seat is just like other airlines, food was good. The stewardess is very helpful however their English is a bit difficult to understand. I have to ask him 3 times to repeat the menu, just enough for me to understand that he meant beef with rice. The flight has few turbulence but not a big deal. We're still able to enjoy our meal. The flight was slightly delay but we reach our destination in time.   ."
241,Andrew H,4,Easy to negotiate airport at Da Nang. Easy check in and allowed to check in 23k with no extra charge 👍 Flight left and arrived SGN on time.
241,Handsomestgreg,3,"I took a short flight from Seoul to Bangkok and back transiting through Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines. The flight from Seoul to Hanoi was 9 across with in flight entertainment. Checkin at Seoul was normal and the actual boarding seemed smooth even when it started late. There wasn't too much leg room and I am only 6ft tall, so take that as you will. The food was good and the flight attendants were polite and very helpful. The check-in counter in Vietnam was a lot slower and chaotic (made a week stop in Vietnam before going back to Seoul). Arrive early if flying from Hanoi airport domestically! Very long and the slowest check-in process that I have ever dealt with.  Good overall for the price."
241,946JJ19,5,"Two of us were going to catch the flight at 23.30. Check in opened 2 hours before boarding. Both processes were very efficient. As it was late in the day we were asked whether we wanted to eat or go straight to sleep after take off. The flight left on time and a delicious meal was served soon after. The flight attendants were attentive, friendly and efficient. We landed on time after a very pleasant flight with up to date entertainments."
241,RATAI123,1,"Unfortunately, I had a pretty poor experience with this airline and will avoid flying with them again. <br>Booked a round trip throughout Vietnam with Vietnam Airline. I had 6 flight time changes, which completely messed up my plans, resulting in having to spend hours at the airport due to delays etc. I contacted their airline via email and they had 0 empathy, which was really disappointing to see. <br>Please also be aware, their cabin crew and their airport ground crew can have very limited English, so it was very difficult to communicate with them at times. If I was to book the same trip again, I would rather pay a lot more and travel with another airline."
241,Andrew H,4,Easy to negotiate airport at Hanoi and easy check in. Staff courteous and helpful and flight took off exactly on time
242,Dave,5,Excellent service.  Very comfortable and I don't normal sleep on planes but being able to lie flat was lovely.  Food was good and cocktails delicious.  Could have been a few more films available for a long flight
242,Peter C,5,"I have been using Vietnam airline for 4 yrs on this  route and can not fault there service and value for money. Classed as 2nd tier airline most people are quite sceptical , if you don't mind not drinking tope shelf champagne this is the airline to use"
242,iansiddall7,4,"Flew from London to Ho Chi Minh,flight was on time , the check in was easy, the crew were all friendly, we flew Premium economy which had lots of legroom and was well worth the reasonable extra cost. We also had 2 internal flights and a return flight from Hanoi, all were excellent. All on time and very comfortable."
242,Mark C,5,"Everything was great from checkin to our return flight.  The crew was friendly and helpful, and the seating seemed to provide a little more leg room even in Economy.  My only criticism was that there was an empty row next to us and our row was full and unfortunately another inconsiderate Aussie decided it was his right to take the whole row with no thought for the elder folk around him.  Anyway, but for that both our flights were fantastic, will fly VA again."
242,Mark L,5,"I've flown this airline before and it was (again) very nice. Easy check in, great service, no delays."
243,binonatrip,3,"After I turned up at the chaotically busy Ho Chi Minh City airport at 9.30pm and found the queue with about everyone else in the airport for the check in desk, I was told there was an hour’s delay on this flight. My boarding pass was marked to give me entry to the private area and a drink and food. The drink qualified me for one soft drink and the food was for a packet of crisps. At least it was a quieter area. We finally took off at 1.30am and were told that breakfast was to be served. When it arrived at 3.30am, there was no choice left. <br><br>My reading light kept switching itself on every few minutes and any films kept stopping working. The steward re-set the screen but everything soon reverted to haywire. I reset it my self a couple of times in order to stop the annoying light and try to get some rest. The seats seemed narrower and with less legroom than on the outbound flight. It was not an enjoyable or comfortable flight."
243,Judytripper,3,"We booked and flew Vietnam airlines to Vietnam. All was fine re service on aircraft. My main problem and with other passengers we paid for premium economy which was for our comfort and our flight home they changed the plane which had a seating configuration of 3,3.3 so we were no better off than normal economy. I would expect a refund for the extra money we paid but we will see.."
243,sarahU1662FX,4,"Plenty of room,friendly staff and soft drink included ( flight only took 75 minutes). Efficient check in and boarding."
243,Sightsee108192,1,"I was flying with VietnamAirlines in business class. First seat had a problem and wasn’t adjustable. Their only reaction “we can’t change that, maybe you can change the seat with someone!”. That alone is bad enough. Turned out that the seat that then I got had a broken table. This is definitely not an appropriate service level. Let’s hope they check the engines better than the interior."
243,binonatrip,3,"Although I was travelling alone and making day to day touring arrangements, I do like to have my flights pre arranged. I had booked the 10.30am flight but a couple of days before I received an email from the booking agents which appeared to indicate that this had been cancelled and replaced by a flight half an hour later. I had already prearranged a taxi pick up from Saigon airport. As I had left plenty of time for the flight and my hotel had checked the flight changes and printed out my boarding passes, I went to the check in desk as soon as it opened. They then asked me if I would like to take an earlier flight. It was in fact the same flight number as that cancelled but leaving at 10am, ie 30 minutes earlier than planned. I was told the alteration was due to a an aircraft reconfiguration.<br>I did not welcome the uncertainty this change caused."
244,Ls L,3,"Need more security gates to liberty number of people. After check in, the waiting lounge is small and so noisy, loudly with announcements every single minute..."
244,364danny,3,"A short flight between Hanoi and Da Nang.<br><br>Unorganised embarkation onto plane, with both entrances at the front and back being used, without directing passengers in certain seat numbers to access the entrance that was more relevant to their seat. <br><br>We received a complimentary drink, which we didn’t expect. Overall, the flight was fine and airline service was adequate for the duration of the journey."
244,GoingPlaces111,3,"I actually flew with Vietnam Airlines 3X: from HCMC to Da Nang, then from Da Nang to Hanoi, and then Hanoi to HCMC, all within 1 week. I like how we get a free check-in bag, on top of the free carry-on. Service at the Check-in counter was pretty much normal - like any other airline. I was part of a big group (26) traveling together for flight #1, then a smaller group (6) for #2, then all by myself for #3. For 2 out of 3 flights, we had to be transported by shuttle to/from the aircraft, there is no jet way to board or deplane. Not sure what kind of service they can provide for people who have disability or leg problems and cannot climb stairs, or carry their bags up the stairs. I checked in my carry-on after the first flight, didn't want to be bothered with dragging it up and down the stairs and in and out of the shuttle. There is not much leg room, and limited service on board. I think water/juice/tea were offered. All of my flights were less than 2 hours, I didn't even get up to use the bathroom. So I really didn't expect much. My biggest concern was the delay. We were delayed for about 1.5 hour during flight #1, and about 45 min for flight #2, and on time for flight #3. I think one should be mindful of the possibility of delays, but it's not a big deal.<br><br>All in all, I think Vietnam Airlines is fine. I haven't tried their international flight, so I have no idea of how its going to be. The price is good, especially when you factor in the free check-in bag. I would fly with this and not gamble with Viet Jet. My husband flew Viet Jet from Hong Kong to Vietnam, his flight was delayed for 3 hours. And no leg room whatsoever."
244,Kofu-Shi Boy,4,"What one would hope for on an international flight. Great selection of movies, delicious food options, and enough legroom to get a little sleep."
244,johnflexer878,3,Need to state that we flew Premium Economy which is not an option above. The flight is direct to Hanoi and is serviced by a 787 Dreamliner. The seating was comfortable with plenty of legroom. The TV screens come out of the chair arm and the screen size and quality were good. The food was ok but the food service was not that generous for an 11-hour flight. Also the airline is not very generous with their drinks. The cabin crew were polite and efficient but I never felt that they really engaged with the passengers. One concern was with cabin safety. On coming in to land there was no check on seats being in the upright position or seat belts being fastened. A minor concern maybe but makes you think what other safety checks do they fail to observe.
245,John1carter,2,"Comfortable enough seats in business but on both my outward and inward journeys to and from Hanoi, they were unable to provide my first choice for dinner - I was in the sixth row going and third row returning so this shouldn't have been the case.  <br><br>Staff were pleasant but forgot the drinks I had ordered on both flights. <br><br>The area around my seat had not been properly cleaned on the outward journey with debris from the inbound flight in the tray and locker."
245,Lyntonjen,3,"Seating was not really comfortable, as there was barely enough room for a medium height person. Someone with long legs travelling with us was quite uncomfortable. There were no nibbles provided with drinks."
245,Salman H,4,"I bought the tickets from Oman Air, and they were in co shier, which I used locally from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi. The aircrafts were new and clean and the crew was smiling and cooperative despite the local chaos and trying to control their organization. The meals were enough fine. In my opinion that the guest does not know more than this limit in the affairs of aviation!more !"
245,clarky1501,3,"Flew to hi Chi Minh Vietnam. Flight was delayed going out but still arrived on time. Staff were professional and efficient but not many smiles during flight. Food was typical airline food- choice of two meals- drinks included which was good. Meal had adequate amount of food but was nothing special. Flight coming home was also delayed but again arrived in Sydney on time. fight crew much happier on this flight ( and we had turbulence most of the way). Food was same quality as going out- two choices and if you don't eat seafood ( as I don't) then it's down to one. I did enjoy my meals but it's hard to get excited about plane food. Check-in both ways was done efficiently by staff. Not being able to take a drink to the boarding area( in ho Chi Minh) was strange, you couldn't buy one there or bring one ,you had to drink it before last security check( which isn't unusual) but you couldn't even buy water in waiting area but you could buy souvenirs. Enjoyable flight but no where near a 5 star. Seats where ok for width ( but I'm short) and leg room.comfort packs where ok, blanket is a good size and pillow was soft. Inflight entertainment was ok and had a reasonable choice of movies( yes they weren't current) but plenty of choice. I would pick a flight with them over Qantas as I thought they were all over the better  carrier( not impressed with Qantas for the price). I would definitely fly with them again but don't expect 5 star because they aren't but over all an enjoyable flight both ways. A bit expensive but you can pick other airlines if you want no frills flights. Baggage allowance is their best point 32kg per passenger."
245,julijana š,5,Very nice airline with friendly crew and a lot of leg space to sit normally. Flight was on time and people professional.
246,Karenmac13,5,"Great Ailine to fly with, the flight took off on time, the food &amp; service was great. The in flight intertainment was also very good."
246,helenP1770GS,4,"I recently flew on Vietnam Airlines internationally and domestically.  The positives about this airline is firstly the pricing, which is fantastic!  They are extremely reliable and friendly staff, more leg space than other airlines in economy class, and comfortable.Plus they allow 40kg whether it's an international or domestic flight.  The only negative was the food, it was disappointing, so on the way home I opted not to have dinner before boarding.  I do recommend this airline though."
246,Geoff Musselwhite,3,Our first impression was helpful check-in staff. The flight left on time but economy class was the same as numerous other airlines - average. Leg room was not good but cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The food was average. It was a 12 hour flight - the cramped conditions made me restless and unable to sleep.
246,Emm,4,"We recently flew business class from London to Hanoi return, with a several internal flights as well. Negatives, the food. For us it was just not business class quality. Presentation and service was good, it just lacked quality especially the chicken dish we had coming back, it wasn’t breast of chicken but I think thigh/leg meat. But then having travelled 3 weeks around Vietnam it was what we came to expect unless we asked. What do they do with all the chicken breast in Vietnam? This dish also lacked flavour and both my husband and myself left it. It had been a substitute for a pork dish we both ordered, but due to recent swine flu epidemic they had changed it. The service lounges leave a lot to be desired as well. One was right out of communist 60’s, and the staff only got up from where they were sitting eating to check our ticket. They did not clear any tables of rubbish while we were there. Having said that the Pho, (packet) was the best tasting we had tried!!! Along with the pitiful cakes/buns on offer that was it! The bigger lounge wasn’t the unusual business class standard either. With not much selection on offer, although you could generally find something even if it meant dairylea and bread and butter!! I think they could also do with tightening up their business class/economy class queues! Flights were called and board said boarding, but plane wasn’t even ready! We queued in the business class line, but there were people in front of us with economy class tickets, we even mentioned to the guy in front of us that he was in the wrong line, he just shrugged and remained. Despite this everyone went through. Now I know that sounds a bit snobbish, but what is the point of paying extra for these little differences if they are not dealt with in a professional manner. Toilets are small, and were not always stocked with the sprays and bits and pieces you get on business flights, they must have run out on the way out as my husband commented on the nice face freshener in the loo, but it wasn’t there when I went!  Overall, though I still have given 4 stars. At the end of the day it was a very comfortable flight, bed lies completely flat and I rested well. The staff even if though their English isn’t that good are very polite, professional and helpful. It is a question of you pay for what you get and this was a cheaper business class flight. Also, I had the misfortune to leave a favourite scarf behind (not expensive just one I like a lot) on the way out. On my return to the airport 3 weeks having passed, I thought I would enquire anyway, not expecting to ever see it again. Well, having gone through quite a rigmarole, a lost property office where I managed to explain in a way that was understood that I’d left my scarf on the plane, I was then told to follow, pointed in the direction of another office,  I went through security x-rays, to another office with police with guns, I finally got my scarf back though nobody talked to me the whole time, just pointed to sit, pointed to sign and pointed to leave! So communication is something they all need to get better at!! I would recommend Vietnam airlines, if you don’t mind the food not being up to much. Also, and this is more airport secuity more than Vietnam airlines fault, I actually went through one of their security checks with a two litre bottle of water in my back pack. It actually went through the scanner and came out the other side without a blink of an eye. So I think security could be looked at and tightened because even though I knew I was ok, someone else may not have been, and this aspect of it made me very nervous of flying within the country!"
246,Amanda Hey,1,"I will not be travelling with Vietnam Airlines again!!!! Multiple flight changes which resulted is us missing  accommodation we had paid for and tours!!! Our holiday dates had to be changed due to cancelled flights meaning more time off work!!! I have sent multiple complaint emails and and only heard back from one and that was just confirming my booking details!!! Our flight from Ho Chi Minh to Nah Trang was cancelled and we were told we would be put up in Ho Chi for the night (more on that later) Due to this we lost a night with our Luxury Escape package and had to notify them and cancel that night due to the package including transfers! After complaining in sydney about this when we did land in Ho Chi the airline said a Nha Trang flight was delayed and we could get to Nha Trang that night, however due to having to pre cancel our accommodation we had no where to stay and the airline would not help us find anywhere so they were happy to send 2 woman in a strange country with no idea on the area and no accommodation somewhere at 8pm at night!! In the end we had to stick to the accommodation supplied to us by the airline in Ho Chi Minh and have a 4.30am pick up! To say the accommodation was bad is a understatement! When we left the airport just on  dark the airline staff told us to no leave the hotel, too dangerous, airline would not look after us if something happened...Great start to holiday!!! Arrive at the hotel and couldn’t eat anything with the food vouchers we were given as it looked like we would get sick  from it (have since spoken to others who did get sick) so off a flight from Sydney and no food for the night! We did not feel safe at all in the hotel and hardly slept! I have tried to contact Vietnam airlines multiple times and nothing!!! Next time I will fly Jetstar over Vietnam and that’s saying something!!!"
247,Andy P,5,We visit London every 18 months or so to see family. This time we went Vietnam Airlines because we wanted to stopover in Vietnam on the way home. The price was good value and service was excellent. The aircraft type was A350 Melb to Saigon and 787 Dreamliner from Saigon to London. Both aircraft new and very good lay flat seats. The only negative was the 8 hour layover on the way there. Not enough time to leave airport and too long to be at airport terminal. On the way back it didn’t matter because we did a 2 week stopover but it is not a good choice for straight through. I hope they change the timing in the future as we would use every time
247,Judy H,2,"The two best things I can say about the flight is that it got us there safe and on time. Apart from that there was not much else positive about the flight. Plane looked old, and attention to pre take off requirements like seatbelts etc minimal.<br>When landed, getting our luggage took longer than our flight - over an hour.<br>But, safe and sound is good these days."
247,Roger L,4,"Can not find fault with this airline, the crews are very professional and friendly.  Sitting in the lounge waiting for the flight listening to so many other airline announcements about being delayed by hours or cancelled due to operational reasons.  Vietnam Airlines is far more reliable for internal travel."
247,binonatrip,5,"I was very impressed with this flight. Excellent check in staff with good communication who explained that while I had already checked in before reaching airport selecting an aisle seat, due to a change in configuration of the aircraft, I was being moved just a few rows behind. No problem. I had a spare seat next to me and this allowed a Vietnamese lady to stretch out during the flight. Food good, the lady next to me did not want hers, gave it to me.<br><br>While I thought the airline experience on this flight was a class apart, also offering excellent service, unfortunately it fell apart on my next two VA flights."
247,roadless120,5,"Really on the ball throughout. The check in staff were better than first class, very knowledgeable about visas as it is quite a complex process if you are coming out of Vietnam and back in again as we were from Cambodia.<br>The plane was Boeing 787 Dreamliner - first class plane with good leg room. The in flight entertainment was good.<br>The cabin staff were very helpful, willing and available. The price is right and I would recommend to one and all. We have done this trip several times over the last few years."
248,lyttlemarg,2,"No food or drink service, not even a water, old tired plane, glad it was a short flight, no in flight entertainment, (including music) Not sure why it was a business class flight, it wasn't even premium economy"
248,Kevin griffiths,5,Although the flight was long.The time passed quickly the plane is equipped with on board entertainment. the food was not great but enable.The flight back was a bit turbulent but not uncomfortable.
248,offshore09,3,"cant really complain the flight was short but had to take bags off AF flight and recheck in, it was easy enough and i was business so got voucher to go into the lounge, very few business seats on the short flight but staff did best they could and no complaints but did have an untidy feeling to it"
248,Mac1,1,"Not worth the money travelling business class with this airline. <br>Positive- check in, lady really helpful and put us on an earlier flight at no cost. Separate and quick business class transfer bus. Luggage arrived quickly.<br>Negative- business class lounge food awful. Come on top chef Luke Nyegan ( brand ambassador) !!!! cold french fries???? unbelievable. On boarding plane everyone made comment on the smell inside the cabin. Similar to a wet dirty dog or stagnant water. Complained to the female attendant who said she did not know what the smell was - she got the spray from the toilet and sprayed the first two rows!!<br>Male attendant at the front did no work throughout the flight apart from read out the audio messages. Played on his tablet and both on take off and landing did not fasten his seatbelt( breach of CAA regulation). In flight meal was 3 tiny triangular sandwiches- Luke????? You need to do some sample testing otherwise your professionalism could be questioned!!<br><br>If you need to use this airline use economy not business class, be warned."
248,Mindy,5,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines, choosing to pay the extra for Premium Economy Seating, for our March 2019 trip to Vietnam.  All staff from checking in at Sydney Airport to the Flight Attendants were very professional and courteous.  Seating was comfortable, meals of good quality produce, excellent variety of beverages included and entertainment selection.  A very comfortable flight.  During our 16 day tour we also had 3 Internal Flights with Vietnam Airlines and found it to be an excellent service.  Our Economy seats were allocated and there was plenty of room in the overhead lockers to store our carry on luggage.  The cabins, seating and toilets were clean and the flights ran to schedule."
249,The_bald_gourmet,4,"I recently flew from Hong Kong to Sydney via Ho Chi Minh City.  Check in was easy and the staff were excellent.  The lounge staff at Ho Chi Minh in particular were delightful. The food on both legs of the flight was also excellent.  Transit was easy even if the ground staff person that I met was the most rude and miserable flight ground staff I have ever encountered.  The flight from Hong Kong was comfortable and efficient.  The problem with the flight to Sydney was that the ""flat bed"" in business had a metal bar across the seat right in line with one's lower back.  By scrunching up to the top of the seat I was able to get a few hours' sleep.  Overall a reasonably good experience."
249,tricia275,4,Due to food poisoning myself and my husband had to miss a flight from Hanoi to Danang but booked a flight with Vietnam Airlines the following day. We then found out that all our future flights on a 2 week trip had been cancelled by the airline as we had failed to turn up for our original flight - even though my husband and our tour company had emailed the airline to explain. However we went to the airline desk at the airport and the staff on the desk were fantastic especially Ms Le Hoa. They managed to get us on the flight we should have been on with our friends by running us through to the boarding gate and they reinstated all of our future flights for our tour. It was such a relief and I cannot thank them enough for all their help.We flew Premium Economy and it was well worth it for the extra leg room etc on international flights.
249,David B,3,"The flight was on time and everything was pretty efficient. We took off at 1.00am and were given a meal which was good. I know it was sleep time but absolutely nothing then until nearly nine hours later. They ran out of water - really?Then breakfast. There is an option but they had ran out of the western option so it was noodles and prawns or nothing. My wife dislikes sea food so just the ancillary bits for her. Surely it is just a case of analysing the passenger list to have a good idea of the who will take up which option. Come on guys you run this same flight every day, I thing, so it just needs a bit of thought. It is a direct flight so definitely sufferable again because of that fact."
249,jjumpstart,4,"We flew Sydney to Hanoi on a 787 Dreamliner and the economy seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom. We also flew Hanoi to Quy Nhon on an Airbus A321 which was ok with no complaints.<br><br>The food was average (ok) and free alcohol was included with meals.<br><br>The 787 flight was only half full and the staff encouraged passengers to spread out into vacant seats and make themselves comfortable.  It was just as well the flight wasn’t full as half the toilets were blocked off (or out of order), and there would have been a few long queues if the flight was full (I had the feeling they may have locked a few off to save on cleaning etc???).<br><br>I’m usually good with accents, but I did have difficulty understanding many of their in-flight announcements."
249,Sandra F,5,"We travelled in Premium Economy, the seats were very roomy &amp; comfortable, the food was good &amp; the service excellent."
250,Ian H,4,"When I retired I always said I would travel to Australia. We did this as a cruise but decided to go business class on our way back. We had the option of British Airways or Vietnam airlines. The same seats, same plane but Vietnam was £2000 cheaper, a no brainier.<br>The stewards were excellent as was the food. A good movie choice also which made the flight go so much quicker"
250,AP,5,"Flew on Vietnam Airlines from London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City In Vietnam on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in premium economy class. First of all, I highly recommend premium economy and the extra legroom really helps with getting to sleep, as well as priority check in and boarding which was good to skip long queues. Normally I hate airplane food so much but the food on this flight was not bad at all. The staff were very friendly and would attend to anything. However to improve this flight, I found that the in flight entertainment was very limited but overall I highly recommend this airline."
250,B0bJ,5,"Our flight was on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which looked very new with many modern touches not seen in other mainstream airlines.  I am tall but found the legroom adequate in economy class. The seatback entertainment options were excellent and the meal service above my expectations, as was the amenity kit.  The cabin crew were helpful ,  attentive and absolutely charming. Despite the 12 hour flight, my memory of the flight is a positive one."
250,Jennifer T,1,"Dinner arrived, was told that there was only one option left as after row 26 they ran out of the pork and the fish with mornay was left. Lifted the foil lid and it looked like vomit. Thought I was the only one who took a deep breath but then I heard others complaining to the flight attendants. They only offered me a bread roll, didn't take it. Pissed off. Asked for a cold beer, don't have one, asked for a glass of wine and it was hotter than the vomit they offed me. Went to the back to get a cold beer was told they don't serve cold beer only beer with ice in it, they lady in the yellow dress said it saves on costs. I love going to Vietnam 7 times now, but now I have to go around the world to get there rather than use Vietnam Airlines. The toilets were clean."
250,Sam,5,Since my first flight in November 2014; I understood the quality of Vietnam airlines and its constant effort to go ahead. Thus I've stopped using other airlines since  then when I travel to Europe. Excellent service and immediate replies in case of queries
251,Jeff K,5,"When flying within Vietnam or to the surrounding countries in SE Asia, Vietnam Airlines is a great choice. The counter staff is friendly and organized, the planes were clean and we had lots of legroom even in economy. We have flown other airlines and Vietnam standards seemed that much higher. Thanks for the ride!"
251,244Diane10,3,We travelled internally in Vietnam on 3 Vietnam Airlines flights and every flight was delayed. My husband got good poisoning during the night before our last  flight and  was feeling awful in the morning.  We arrived at the airport to hear the flight was delayed. My husband found a spot to lie down over 3 seats at the airport while waiting for our flight. Then it was announced the gate no. had changed. Eventually  we boarded the plane but then sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes in a hot plane before take off. Doubt we will ever use Vietnam Airlines again. You can understand one flight bring delayed but 3 out of 3!   The excuse each time was the late arrival of the plane. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out the plane would have left it's destination late to arrive late. We also constantly heard announcements at the airport about  other Virtnsm flights being delayed.
251,SSChua28,4,"We travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi before flying back to Kuala Lumpur. I must say our first and second leg was not too pleasant as it was marred by a massive flight delay. Our flight from KL to HCM City was delayed by almost two hours but this was nothing compared to the flight delay from HCM City to Hanoi. That was almost a 4 hours delay resulting in a whole day wasted as by the time we reach our hotel at Hanoi it as almost too late to do anything except to find our dinner. This was made up by our return flight from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur. This was on time, thank goodness. Service-wise there is no complaint at all. The service crew were lovely and very obliging."
251,Frank S,4,An enjoyable three hour flight with actual leg space you Do Not find in economy with any of the Canadian airlines and at a most reasonable cost. Had good service as well at check-in and on board. A good meal was served. Will fly with them again if we're back that way.
251,jopo6662,5,"On a recent tour of Vietnam we had 3 internal flights with Vietnam Airlines..Boarding was efficient,Staff were attentive and seating in Economy class was comfortable..Highly recommended"
252,Scott,4,Overall a very good flight. Attendants were polite and helpful. Food ok and so too was the movie selections
252,Rodney Y,4,Service on this overnight flight was good. I was a bit annoyed to see 5 window rows each occupied by only 1 women (all seemed to be friends). Apparently they paid $50 extra whilst the rest of us were relatively jammed in together. Having a privileged few in economy was an insult. They should have paid for business class which at least was separate from us. We were 3 in a middle row to start with but the steward said he'd do something for us. After take off he came and found us a middle row for just the 2 of us. Thank you we got some sleep. Others were not so lucky.
252,yycyycyyc,4,"A friendly and enjoyable flight of 2.5 hours. Good service, at check-in and on board, a decent breakfast meal (the omelette tasted better than it looked!) Will happily fly with them again."
252,Rubyann40,4,"Flight was pleasant as the staff were attentive.  Selection of films, etc., was good and covered a number of subjects and nationalities.  Food was hot and tasty.  Seats reasonably spacious, cushions and blankets available immediately."
252,Reg Val F,4,"Great experience, from check-in, boarding, inflight service to arrival. Cannot fault the service and in hindsight it compares to anything i've experienced previously in air travel. Would I fly with them again - absolutely"
253,Mohalam G,1,"my previous international flight with VN Airlines dated since 1998, and 21 years later, the progress which was boasted is indeed a leap backward. In 2019, there is nothing improved and it's even better to take a bus than any of this airlines.  My in-laws happened to buy a tour in Japan from a local tour operator, and the flight Saigon - Kansai is part of the package.  VN Airlines boasts their on-line checking.  What a joke.  It never works in contrary to any other airlines in the region, and when it works, like 30 minutes before the flight then all seats are already booked. We are in 2019 and this airlines is still operated like in the 1970's and customers are actually people that annoyed the staff.  A couple registered at the same time, and my wife seat was 32C while mine is 37A !  You can tell anything to the staff - both ground and flying crew, they just ignore you.  VN Airlines staff are worldly renown for processing their work, careless of the human customers.  People, customers are simply invisible to those staff and the more you request, the opposite you get.  Communication is of course minimal, English that no one could decipher, less understand. Even in Vietnamese, the staff language defies any professional courtesy, just processing the work. At the meal, I just asked for a cup of water, then no more water, the stewardess served me apple juice on her own.  Asking for beef, she said no more and gave the seafood, then the passenger next to me who spoke Vietnamese (she is Vietnamese) requested seafood and got the beef.  The meal was expedite, and all the staff kept saying we will come back.  You can easily understand that none of them would, or may be on the next flight. But strange as it could be, and never seen on any airlines, even regional ones, the staff gather at the back of the plane to gossip and kept talking for hours so loud !  Like at the street market.  A simple word describe it all: they IGNORE the passengers. <br>Entertainment: none.  The plane was so old to provide any entertainment. Asking for a cup of water or orange juice, or coffee, and the answer is automatically;""Later one, we will bring it to you!""  Later with Vietnam Airlines staff means either forget it or never.<br>I guess every passenger was so happy to land and got out of this plane.  My evaluation is not even one star, but with the rating system of Trip Advisor, I have to put 1 star.  My recommendation is very clear: avoid this airline for any international flight, unless you take domestic flight in Vietnam, then you have no choice since it has the monopoly. <br>Of course, congratulations to Vietnam Airlines to use before any other airlines humanoid, less intelligent human that imitate a machine, the opposite of android, an intelligent machine that imitates man."
253,Frances B,4,"I found travelling with Vietnam Airlines really good. Their dedicated check-in desks at Hanoi airport were efficient and well staffed.<br>Although the flight was full, it was a new plane and really clean. The air stewards/stewardesses were all very friendly and well turned out.<br>The flight was only just over an hour long but during this time all passengers were offered a cold drink.<br>I would have no hesitation flying with this airline again, particularly on short haul trips."
253,MomentswithMel,5,"I was extremely nervous about this fkifht as it was my first long haul trip and I really didn't know what to expect.<br><br>After travelling with Vietnam Airlines I wish I had started long haul travel years ago! They would hand out meals and snacks every few hours, the food was delicious. We were given, our own individual blankets and pillows. The only thing missing was an eye mask!<br><br>Staff were very friendly and helpful. Book your flight now, you won't regret it!!"
253,lyndaclayton,1,"I booked our flights from Heathrow to Hanoi via Tamworth Co Op Travelcare.  Several times both my travel agent and myself tried to pre book sheets for the flight, even upgrade, but we were told this was not possible.  We had to wait until check-in 24 hours before we could book our seats, only to find that all the sheets were taken and we were left with 2 seats at the back.<br><br>The service overall was appaulling.  We were only offered 1 drink on outward and inward bound trips.  The food was dreadful.  As we were at the back of the plane on both trips, we were only left with one food choice as they had run out of the other option.  What was served, I would not give to a dog.<br><br>The staff were not friendly and it seemed too much trouble for them to help.<br><br>I would definitely never fly with this airline again.<br><br>Avoid at all costs."
253,Linda C,3,Very quick internal flight. Very basic seats...not particularly comfortable. Food was not good....no choices and the 'sandwich' was not very pleasant. Just something which had to be endured in order to travel quickly from north to south of country.
254,Diana T,5,"Pleasant flight.  The seats were spacious &amp; legroom.  Though our flight was a short flight, we got wet tissue &amp; fruit juice<br>Check in was orderly &amp; fast.  Will fly this airline when opportunity arises"
254,Janet B,5,"We flew London to Hanoi choosing premier economy seats. They were fabulous, so much space. You don’t annoy passengers behind by reclining. Food was good and they served sparkling wine. Happy flight."
254,TravelWeary49,5,A Sunday flight to London in economy on what appeared to be a new 787-9. A total surprise at the seat comfort and amount of legroom - at least 4” more pitch than Thai Airways. Service was good and the food was fine. All in all an extremely pleasant surprise.
254,Jennifer T,5,The plane was very clean the staff smiling and the food wasnt that bad at all overall a nice flight remember to alway go wiuth the flow as different countries have different values.
254,Kay L,1,"I experienced first-hand what it means to be a customer of Vietnam Airlines in February 2019. First of all, they have an issue on their website that doens't recognize UATP card. I was trying to book a flight VN522 from SGN to PVG on February 24, 2019 using UATP card and VN website recognizes that it is UATP card, yet shows an error - “Credit Card number is short”.<br><br>Following two days of email and phone communication with VN team, they still could not resolve the issue. As a result of this ongoing issue and lack of your Reservations team’s support, the price of a ticket has gone up from $282 to $356.<br><br>In the end, I decided to give up due to lack of support. I purchased a ticket using another (undesirable to me) form of payment. <br><br>When you get to SGN airport, Vietnam Airlines check-in process is simply terrible, never seen anything like that. I was in line for 1:20 minutes. Because the line was so long, their staff was running around with signs for flights boarding in the next 30 minutes and they pulled those customers out of the line, effectively penalising those who arrived early and wanted to check-in without any rush. Those people were left behind in favor to those who arrived last minute. Disgraceful! In fact, passengers were very vocal about this terrible practice, which happened over and over for flights from SGN to Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. <br><br>Overall, if you wish to fly in or out of Vietnam, do consider other options, because most airlines who operate out of Saigon and Hanoi are not even close as busy and don't put ALL passengers for ALL flights in one long line."
255,Tantrumxp,3,"My arrival flight from SGN to CXR was vietjet. return was business class on Vietnam Airlines. The plane was pretty old. A321. the business class seats were dirty and worn. I wish i had taken The Skyboss on Vietjet Airlines. Service was fine. i expected a little more in terms of product from the biggest airline in Vietnam. We did have our private bus from terminal to plane and vice versa. This flight was on-time. everything was fine, just thought the seats would have been cleaner."
255,Manager119,4,A very nice Airline ! We had a Great SAFE  round trip from Bangkok to Hanoi and it was  a very nice flight. Very polite cabin Crew they all speak english very good and clear. <br>The captain and his Co pilot made it a very smooth take off  Flight and Landing and the lunch was well cooked and tasty. No delays in Ceck In  and both flights were on time .<br>Its a BIG YES and thank you from us for VITENAM AIRLINES.
255,David M,5,"Great service and very comfortable flight. The choice of food was good with a range to suit any taste. The Vietnamese dishes were very tasty. The staff were attentive and helpful. Over all, a very good flight, twelve and a half hours from Heathrow to Ho Chi Min City airport. Not delays, luggage transferred without problem. Couldn’t ask for much more."
255,Tim S,5,"We had a 5 PM flight from Hanoi to DaNang. We didn’t want to push it as we were arriving by train around noon so 5 seemed fine. Arrived at airport slightly before noon and had to wait to check in. Went to Vietnam Airlines counter and they said our flight was delayed 1 hour but they said they would try to get us our on 2 PM flight. Bingo, we’re on the flight. What a great experience not having to wait it out at the airport"
255,ChrisandSueDopson,5,"Flight from Siem Reap was called on time and produced a good comfortable trip, The crew were very friendly and efficient, (very much liked their uniforms)  it was a short flight to Ho Chi Minh so no food provided but they gave us a bottle of water.<br>   In short nice airline."
256,Alex D,5,The flight was great. It departed early. Even for a short flight but they served Vietnamese sandwich with some drinks. Flight-attendants were friendly. I will always choose this airlines if I have a choice
256,Sabina T,3,"The main thing for me was to have a direct flight and to reach my destination in a shortest possible time. Check in was a nightmare as most Vietnamese had boxes and boxes of baggage and we were queuing for over an hour. They should have a separate queue for passengers with normal luggage. The cabin crew was attentive and professional. The food was ok, however for a lengthy flight could provide a couple of extra snacks. It was as comfortable as it could be in the economy class. Providing a pair of sleepers and a toothbrush with little toothpaste was a nice touch."
256,Grantman66,5,"I've flown VA a number of times over the last few years and really now prefer it to the other carrier's available out of Hong Kong.  I was booked on a flight from HAN to PVG (Shanghai) recently and at check in asked about upgrade space.  The staff at the airport upgraded me and my daughter for less then $200.00 USD a ticket which was far less than what the tickets were when I bought them.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Business class was extremely nice for this haul, a new Airbus A350.  Entertainment was quality and the food was, typical of VA, excellent, as was the service.  I would recommend Viet Nam airlines to anyone and will now fight to get a seat in the front of the plane, at least on that bird."
256,Hanh Van Pham,4,"Decided to choose Deluxe Economy as it was &lt; $200 more expensive than Economy. Experience proved that it is worth spending more: Legroom is much more generous, meal contains slightly more food and most importantly, sky priority saved me lots of time queueing in check-in and baggage claim counter. In-flight entertainment was diverse, crew were quick and friendly, sandwich was delicious and available infinitely! Something to improve: My entertainment screen was unable to touch, pre-recorded announcements were very hard to hear as the plane was much louder, fly attendants forgot to serve café and tea after the first meal.<br>Nonetheless, would definitely recommend this airline."
256,Offmefarm,5,"Seats were fantastic. Flat and roomy. Food excellent but maybe a little light on.<br>Loved that we were met at airport by airline staff who organised our baggage from Saigon to Hanoi and then same at Hanoi. Silliness of visa for transit but the staff made it easy. On the way back from Paris we flew code share with Air France. Fabulous food but the seats were not nearly as good. Much older plane. Stopover for 12 hours in Saigon. Provide with hotel, tour of city and 2 meals- all include in the $4400 cost of the return ticket Melb to Paris. Will be very hard to go back to economy on a long haul flight! Would rather save more and travel with Vietnam Airlines. Code share partners are pretty good too so SkyTeam will be our preferred points system"
257,Explorer728870,5,Just ensure if you are getting a connecting flight you collect your bags and take to small counter on the right as you head outside. They check you luggage the you walk to domestic terminal. Bags are not automatically onforwarded to your next flight. Hanoi &amp; Danang automatically onforward your bags. Great airline though we flew 5 flights and had a great time on all flights
257,cwsjms,5,We booked through DialAFlight and were very pleased with their service as we have been previously. Although flying direct from London to Hanoi cost a bit more it was well worth it not to have an intermediate stop. The lounges were good and the Dreamliner does the journey in under 11 hours in great comfort. The return was not quite as good and took over 12 hours but both flights ran to time. The food was excellent and the staff very attentive.
257,dmrbay,5,This was the first time I fly with Vietnam Airlines and flew between 1. Phnom Penh - Hanoi  2. Hanoi- Da Nang 3. Da Nang - Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). The planes were very clean and good leg space for the economy class. Very reasonable prices and on-time flights. Baggage Allowance 20K and 7 kg carryon. Buy directly from Vietnam Airlines web site so it will be easy to check in with your reservation code. I bought one ticket from another site and I had difficulty to check in with the reservation number.
257,Jule0902,3,"On journey out ran out of food choice for the dinner, was told they would start at rest of plane for breakfast so breakfast choice would be guaranteed, did not do this so no choice again.  Ran out of drinks, only water and juice available.<br><br>Woke me up for food, not that I had a choice to choose from, but did not wake me up when handing out entry documents that had to be completed prior to entering country.<br><br>Journey back again ran out of choice for food, was left with fish option, explained that I couldn’t eat fish was offered a plain bread roll. The cabin manageress noticed I didn’t have food, managed to get home from business class for my roll.<br><br>Was told they bring 50% of each choice and once it’s gone, it’s gone.  Poor service for 14 hour flight, felt everything was rushed so staff could get their heads down.<br><br>TV screen not working on way out and not much better on return.<br><br>Travelled with airline 2 years ago and feel they have declined greatly in the service they provide."
257,Starbucks,1,"국가모독적 발언과<br>국가차별적 발언을 한<br>thang이라는 cabin manager 가<br>베트남 항공에 근무하는 한<br>베트남항공은 선진 항공사가 아니라고 생각한다<br><br>Your contemptuous attitude toward the disabled.<br>I knew well about the hateful attitude toward Koreans.<br>You're not qualified as a manager.<br>Also, you are far less qualified as a flight attendant.<br>I hope someday you will be judged by your comments &amp; actions."
258,Basia,5,Plane was clean and extra leg room was a plus staff were efficient and friendly the free hot meal was a bonus and delicious
258,Martha C,4,"Impressed with the legroom we had in economy  food was no better or worse than any other airline except for the coffee.  It was dire .  Current films showing , which was good Flights on time, always a bonus Would use again without any qualms"
258,Phan Thế Anh,4,"I think the food this time was bad, I used this airline many times and my last experience with them is quite bad, but the service is quite nice btw"
258,Noddy52,3,"Recently travelled with Vietnam Airlines, from Phnom Penh to Da Nang and return.  The Flight from Phnom Penh to HoChiMinh City was on time, however the flight from HCM  to Da Nang was 1.5 hrs late, the return flight from Da Nang to HCM was changed and flight time was put back, then the flight was delayed which made us almost miss the connecting flight back to Phnom Penh, which luckily was also late.<br>Have flown with Vietnam Airlines before and have had a cancelled flight the have experienced flight delays, seems common for this airline.<br>Once on the flight the service is satisfactory."
258,Keith T,4,Our flight out to Ho Chi Minh City had been exceptional in having lots of spare seats but the return did not have this luxury.  Our flight was delayed with no real explanation of the cause.  Eventually boarding proceeded and we got aisle and middle seats as requested. The legroom was adequate for my wife but a little tight for me. The service on this overnight flight was good and the entertainment on offer also about average.  We had no major issues with our flight it arrived only a little later than advertised.  As we had an onward flight from Terminal 3 this gave us sufficient time to use the free transfer and still be in time for checking in.  This was our first experience of this airline and we would have no hesitation of using them again
259,Tim L,3,average value and services<br>lounge in Guangzhou china is lower standard for business class services<br>bad
259,Alan B,3,"The flights and service were just fine, but the Dreamliner experience was not really special at all. <br><br>We had hoped for something more special, and perhaps were looking for too much? <br><br>The pilots made two very good landings, which is what really counts, of course!<br><br>Vietnam service is not as superb as Singaporean or Malaysian, for example.<br><br>The film selection was not very up to date, but there were some interesting local, Vietnamese films that were worth watching, if you wanted to get a feel for the local lifestyles of several decades ago, or some of the problems of living through a war, and could put up with subtitles."
259,SouthCoastBritRachel,3,"We flew business out and back from London to Ho Chi Minh city. The staff were friendly but not madly efficient. On our return my husband was asked if he would like a cocktail before dinner and he ordered a whisky and ginger but wanted to  mix it himself as usually the whisky is drowned in the ginger. he got a large tumbler of ginger, and the whisky in a small bottle which rather defeated the object!<br>I was not asked if I would like a cocktail but did get some wine with my meal which he did not. The whole service was very rushed and the food was ok but not great.<br>The seats were not particularly comfortable for my small frame and the seat belt is strangely solid on one side which made it uncomfortable for sleeping. The seats fully recline but because of the sculpturing of the seat they are fairly uncomfortable. I should not complain too much thinking of the poor souls in economy!<br>My biggest gripe is that having flown 12 hours to Saigon we then had an onward fight to Siem Reap. This should have been a couple of hours wait, but the flight was cancelled leading to a six hour wait. As the onward flight was single class with no business class available, we were denied use of the lounge despite having flown by far the longest stretch business."
259,Mac1,1,"I would not recommend flying business class on a domestic flight with this airline. It is not worth the money. The worst experience having flown for over 30 years. Can only select your seats from within 24 hours and even then the website did not work as although managed to select seats eventually we did not receive our boarding cards as advised. The check in experience was cold and unprofessional. No welcome or feeling your custom was appreciated. The business class lounge experience was terrible. The place was not clean and again the staff were not welcoming or even appear interested. (complete opposite of our experiences in Ho Chi Minh hotel and around the city which was first class and very polite and respectful) When boarding called busses were used and a separate bus for business class passengers. The staff did not pay attention to who got on it and ended up overfull with others who were in economy , no control whatsoever. On board the attitude of one of the attendants was shocking. Very cold in her approach, appeared disinterested and rushed through with the service. The seat area was dirty, the seat controls did not work and the meal was disgusting. It was meant to be a breakfast but was a tasteless bean type pie with salad green leaves that were wilted bordering on rotten. I cannot believe top Chef Luke NgYuen who is the brand ambassador for this airline would endorse and associate his profession and integrity to this standard of food. Asked if they had a glass of wine and was bluntly told there was none. The tea provided was awful.<br><br>Really disappointed with this flight given the price we paid to fly business class. Not worth the money at all and VA really need to review the service and the training given to the attendants who they are selecting to work in business class however saying that the attitude would not be acceptable in economy class. And Luke do some spot checks!"
259,Steve T,4,Comfortable Boeing dreamliner with good service ang reasonable food. Legroom in economy better than most imo and mostly male staff very attentive.
260,Brannon Wheeler,5,On time. comfortable seats. no food service on the short flight. seats are comfortable and attendants are friendly.
260,Andy,5,"All good with premium economy( go in Business class when lining up as well) extra leg room extra attention from staff which made drinks and food more readily available, all in all a good experience."
260,Bridstow,5,This was our first experience of Vietnam Airlines. It was a 12.5 hour flight.<br><br>Our flight was about 30 minutes late leaving and 45 minutes late arriving.<br><br>That aside we had a good air crew - all polite and very efficient.<br><br>The seats in economy were comfortable. The flight wasn’t busy so we had three seats to two of us making it a more pleasant journey.<br><br>The aircraft was very clean and rest room facilities were well stocked and looked after through the flight.<br><br>A good introduction to the airline as we had numerous other flights booked with them during our trip.
260,SH.M,5,"good price, good service. Food was much better than I expected. Flight attendants in Áo dài (Vietnamese traditional tunic) were beautiful"
260,ScotlandWeelass,4,"flew in Premier Economy and also back from Saigon to LHR.   Very happy with this service.  Aircrew were really polite and lovely.   Plane was on time going out, and those in PE were invited to board at the same time as business passengers.  (note this did not happen at Saigon where the ground staff were really rude when we went u to board, and told us we were economy and get to back of line!)<br><br>So good staff on board, lovely slippers, eye masks and hot towels handed out.   Also blankets.  Food okay on way out.  Bit weird on way back.   both ways you could request extra snacks (sandwiches and pot noodles).   IFE was good.  Safety announcements were a bit quiet and I wouldn't have said a lot of safety checks of passengers were carried out in terms of seat belts etc.<br><br>would be very happy to fly with them again and use PE as well.<br><br>Please note that as a vertically challenged soul, legroom was more than generous!  seemed good for tall folks as well (said boyfriend!)"
261,Sandy Ta,4,"Pleasant, good-for value flight<br><br>This is my preferred option to travel to Hanoi: value-for money fares, good food, generous luggage allowance (30kg) and much improved services. The timing was the best for me as I'm traveling with kid and we don't want to do odd hour like earlier morning and mid-night. <br><br>There’s not much of in-flight entertainment except for some classic radio and mini commune screens showing some fun show. It’s fine by me as the flight is relatively short (~3h), I read a book while my 4-year olds happily explored the “amazing chair” with music. Just want to highlight that the food now really suited my taste and fresh. I liked the salad and fresh fruit while my son loved the meat and vegetable. I guess Luke Nguyen isn’t just for show. <br>Services also have improved much, the crew smiled a little bit more and was generally polite and gentle when answering requests from passengers. They were quite friendly to kids so it's a plus for me. The skill of pilot was good. Landing and taking off were very smooth, not much jerking which make me really happy (this is the number one reason why I hate flight)."
261,Kippine,1,"Returned Friday from HCM after a challenging flight.  At checkin it was confirmed the flight was overbooked, should have known what to expect 4 hours later!   Change of gates - one end of departures to the other, not announced by staff it just appeared on the board, poor communication was consistent, downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy with resulting bun fight for seats.  We were told the plane had a technical fault but the new plane had spare capacity and we are thinking back to the over booking statement at checkin.  The food was inedible and cold, not seen spam since childhood but a breakfast option, only one drinks service offered in a 14 hour flight, space and seats terrible.  The outgoing leg LHR to HAN was much better but still one drinks service and food inedible.   Staff were pleasant, keeping in mind the challenging system they work within.  Two internal flights were packed and uncomfortable. We will not use this airline again - that is ever."
261,helinapaj,5,"People are friendly, airplane is clean, they give you wet wipe when you start flying for your hands. Prices are really good and definitely would recommend that airline!"
261,SuzyQScotlandUk,1,"When we arrived at Ho chi ming airport we thought the taxi had dropped is off in a different country. The staff were blatantly rude at check in. The lotus lounge was smelling of cooking dirty with lots of people snorting or slurping their food. When leaving the lounge the staff didn't lift their heads no friendliness or smiles. We were put on a separate bus which was old and dirty. The seat on the plane were 2 -2 old style business class. We departed 40 minutes late. The buttons didn't work. The table was dirty and caked underneath with grease. The "" snack"" was inedible and no idea what it was looked like a pastie but hey pasties are usually crisp. The salad leaves were wilted and brown, the fruit was hard with no juice. Love Luke Nguyen the chef but don't understand how he wants to be affiliated with this airlines food. Good arrival process baggage arrived prompt. Was considering this airline from UK not anymore."
261,Chris P,4,"We actually flew premium economy. The extra width and quality of seat plus extra legroom was worth it on a flight of over 12 hours.<br>There are no window blinds but a system whereby they control the amount of light that comes in. So by 1400 UK time, 3 hours into flight it appeared pitch black outside. Didn’t like that aspect."
262,Hiệp,4,Vietnam airline has a good service. I checked in for my flight very fast ( maybe because it's a domestic flight ). The seat was comfortable and the staff very nice. The crew only served drink for passengers because the flight just took only more than an hour
262,Stovi1kanobi,5,"any online review you can read about Vietnam Airlines premium economy does not do it justice, the seats are large and very comfortable with a great pitch recline and foot rests, I am 6 foot 3 and a pretty big guy approx 125kgs, the PE comfort level was amazing, the flight crew could not do enough for us and the check in experience was amazing as PE class customers get express check in just like business class. The food and beverage on offer was also of a very good quality, i can definitely justify and highly recommend the premium economy cost and option when flying Vietnam Airlines"
262,Erik Andreassen,5,"A while since I flew the national carrier, but was surprised how much they have improved.<br>The check in was well organised and quick, staff were very polite and were very helpful.<br>The flight was on time, the in flight meal was very tasty and served with a smile from the excellent air crew.<br>Keep it up Vietnam Airlines, you are right up there with the others where quality &amp; value for money is concerned."
262,Nick T,3,"Wanted to book direct flights to Ho Chi Minh from the UK which meant only one option of using Vietnam Airlines but knowing they used new Dreamliners meant that we should get a great flight!<br><br>On boarding in LHR we were pleasantly surprised at the business class cabin, clean, spacious 1/2/1 seating etc. However straight away it was obvious the seats were not that special.  I am just over 6ft so it is impossible to actually put both legs out fully into the declining width leg space when the seat is reclined, the seats are also very hard and quite uncomfortable and also fairly narrow. <br><br>The next issue was we were only in row 3 however my wife’s first choice of main was already unavailable, bearing in mind approx only 6 people had chosen and the two in front of me did not make her choice it seems they have very few of each meal option  available.<br><br>The flight to HCM was uneventful and service during the flight was good with no issues and luggage was quick to come off the plane so that was good.<br><br>We had a couple of internal flights to Nha Trang, both on much older A321s and the service was ok, both the international flights and domestic are very old fashioned though with regards to no use of phones until at the gate, ICE doesnt come on until about 15 mins after take off and everything switched off about 2o mins before landing.<br><br>Flight home from HCM to LHR was a nightmare, no information on why we couldn’t board then we were told another plane was being brought in but no idea when, only when we complained were we told the first plane was broken unrepairable due to an engine issue and the replacement had other issues that meant it would take time to repair too. We ended up departing a couple of hours late but the service on this flight was very poor, no offers of food or drink for around 10 hours of the flight and no crew around (well one was asleep in their chair!) all in all not great for a £2200 seat!"
262,Billscottmorri,4,"I fly long haul several times a year and thia was my first on Vietnam.<br>It was a 787, so that's a good start. Media choice was fine, food very good, service excellent. <br>I would definately fly VA next time.<br>Short critisim is that the media did not come on until quite late in the flight and was switched off early."
263,61lewism,3,Inside Vietnam you have some choices as to how to fly. Vietnam Air is a good not great airline.  The seats are tight for a wider westerner. There is no entertainment on board and the planes are pretty basic. <br><br>We also flew from Danang to Saigon on Vietnam Air as well. In both cases we flew on an airbus.
263,Anne C,4,"We flew 6 years ago with this airline from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City in economy and found it cramped and we are not large people. So when we were travelling again I had some misgivings especially about luggage allowance as the Vietnamese were very strict and charge quite a bit if you are over so we booked Business Class for the 30 kgs standard allowance for £15 per person extra. This turned out to be more with the extra taxes etc added!<br>I can't comment about economy but business class was worth the extra money, lovely comfortable seat and excellent service, the flight attendants were very helpful and their English was good."
263,maggiemayn0t,5,We travelled on a Dreamliner. Was excellent with much more leg room than other planes. Size of seat was bigger too. Very good service with delicious food (both veggie and non veggie).Good selection of entertainment.
263,jeff5092016,4,"Travelled with 3 others to Hanoi for touring holiday. No real problems at all. None of us being over 5'-8"" tall there was no problem with seat legroom.one of us had some mobility problems but the staff inside the airport and in flight were very helpful. The flight itself was uneventful with plenty to eat and drink on the journey. Flight time was 11 hours. The aircraft staff were fine and were pretty prompt if called for. On the whole a reasonable experience given the flight time. Premium economy is obviously the better choice but the extra cost is quite extreme."
263,Imasha,4,I took a domestic flight within Vietnam on this airline and was pleasantly surprised with their in-flight service because it was upto the International level. Specially their in-flight entertainment was upto date with all the latest movies of the world.
264,Linda K,4,"Recently visited Vietnam for the first time. We booked return fares Premium Economy plus economy for internal flights. For the international legs the seats were comfortable, in flight entertainment although limited was sufficient, there was a choice of menu and quality of wines excellent plus plenty of water.  The staff were friendly and helpful on all flights. The toilets always clean. No comment on the internal flights as they were all quite short. The only negatives for us was that none of the flights left on time and safety checks for hand luggage being either overhead or under the seat was not enforced on some of the flights."
264,Tracy S,1,"We had 6 flights in total (London to ho Chi min, ho Chi min to Hanoi, Hanoi to Danang, Danang to Cambodia, Cambodia to ho Chi min and ho Chi min to London.<br><br>Our premium economy flight from uk, had no food choice available when they reached us, not what you expect when paying a premium price!<br>Two of our flights were delayed first hanoi to Danang by 2 hours, tech fault but not kept informed, flight Danang to Cambodia 5 1/2 hours delay, with 3 fate changes and no info. A fellow passenger gave us more info than the airline after finding it online! They gave us a meal at the boarding gate whilst we were waiting within the hour I was violently ill continuing on the flight. I asked to sit near the toilet but was told to return to my seat when it was obvious seats were unoccupied no water was offered the whole flight.<br><br>I have emailed the airline customer service department twice last time 3 days ago and still nothing. We only had 3 nights booked in Cambodiso when didn't arrive until 3am and being ill we lost two nights. We will definitely not travel with this airline again"
264,Kimberly L,2,"This was my 2nd time flying with VN. My previous experiences were pleasant thus I choose to fly with them again.<br><br>During my recent flight, my family (3 adults) were put to sit at the last few rows of the aircraft. When food service was served, we were only left with the option of ""beef"" as ""chicken"" ran out due to a huge popular selection from the crowd infront. Due to religious reasons, my family and I are unable to consume beef at all. We were then given only a bun as a replacement of the main meal for lunch. This is very unfair for us. It is common in many parts of Asia that people do not consume beef and thus, the airline should have catered more chicken options instead. <br><br>When I feedback this to the airline, we were told that they will look into their menu options internally. I am baffled that with such a common route, the airline had never consider looking into this before.<br><br>This unfair experience is nothing but a great disappointment. <br><br>Never flying with VN anymore."
264,Lee B,4,"We booked in early at the airport and were asked if we wanted an earlier flight, this was great but flight was very full so not very many spare seats. This made travelling up and down the aisles very awkward when they had the drink carts out which seemed to be the entire flight.<br>Our flight was about 1 1/2 hrs and was very smooth"
264,Becky,5,"We actually flew this airline 5 times during our stay in Vietnam.  It was efficient, clean, orderly, and on time,, every time.  We were very pleased."
265,Benton R,5,Very nice airlines.   Staff and crew were very friendly with great service!  Cheaper to book your flight once in country.
265,ESVincent,2,"Vn airlines outsources its upgrades to optiontown. This means that if you want to buy an upgrade you go though optiontown.<br><br>This means that you can get a good value for money upgrade through optiontown BUT this whole process is very problematic.<br><br>First of all you don't get confirmation of your upgrade until a few hours before the flight ( of course you have paid for this in advance), secondly the confirmation doesn't guarantee you the actual upgrade and finally you don't know if you are successful until you get to the gate.<br><br>I had a confirmed upgrade and was then told at the gate that there were no seats available and I was of about four who were confirmed upgrades and then denied. This isnt the problem of optiontown but is very much the problem of Vietnam airlines and its a poor way to do business.<br><br>Optiontown refunded the money in about 7 work day but the whole process was very frustrating and unrewarding. Come on Vietnam airlines you can do better than this and its not a good reflection on its sky-team membership"
265,NickyMoffattdeVries,4,This is the first time I had flown Vietnam Airlines. Seats were very comfortable with plenty of leg room. Food on board was very nice and plenty of choice with drinks. Staff were helpful when required
265,Barry F,5,"We flew back from our Vietnam and Cambodia tour in Premium Economy on Vietnam Airlines Flight number VN55. The seats were very generously sized, comfortable and with a lot of legroom. The  food was very reasonable for airline food with a choice of Asian or European. The choice of films was extensive. The flight took off on time and we arrived at LHR 30 minutes early. Premium Economy gives you priority boarding and priority baggage. We would certainly fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
265,DavidLee1234,5,"We took a night flight from SIN to SGN with a 2hr transit then an over night flight from SGN to NRT. <br><br>Both flights took off and landed on schedule. Great meals both dinner and breakfast, drinks and sevice for both flights. Good IFE on the SGN to NRT flight. I was really impressed that sake was served on an economy flight! Cabin temperature was just cooling enough. All of these for a reasonable price. Will fly Vietnam Air again if needed."
266,arnell b,4,"AWESOME SERVICE from commencing the booking, communication throughout flights (we had two different flights) and after the last flight as well.<br>The communication via email even offering a taxi service was Professional.<br>The cabin attendants were visible throughout and offered me assistance as a physically challenged traveler.<br>booking in was alwyas quick &amp; thorough.<br>My only negative is that Vietnam Airlines publishes your name details in the backward manner which is NOT how it appears on our passports. This resulted in TAIPA FERRY SERVICE in Macau to reject our ferry ticket booking request and we had to proceed to Macay ferry Service who processed without a problem."
266,Traveling Llamas,4,Good economical flight within the country. Clean and friendly service.  Minor challenge as they did not use jetways at the two airports but rather stairs.  Overall good flight that exceeded expectations
266,sandflopper j,5,We travelled premium economy and this was the best we ever experienced on a Boeing 787 (9)  Really comfortable seats with excellent leg room.  really comfy and with a great rake to allow you to sleep.  The downside was that the entertainment system accoustics were not very good.  The food was really decent and head and shoulders above the same service on our National Carrier (BA).  A lovely experience just spoiled by indolent immigration in HCMC airport.  Beware the two hour wait for visas even with letter of intro.
266,Linda H,1,"Just back from holiday and flew from Cambodia to Hanoi, Vietnam then to London Heathrow. In Cambodia we were given boarding cards to Hanoi and premium economy boarding passes (as booked 12 months ago) to Heathrow. Imagine our shock at the boarding gate when the passes to Heathrow were destroyed because the plane had been overbooked according to them. When we arrived in Hanoi we complained along with other passengers who had been downgraded to economy class seats for our 12 1!2 hour flight! We waited for over 2 hours before anyone came to speak us and we're literally boarding before anyone even bothered to speak to us. Their customer service as deplorable. Premium economy seats were booked because our first flight was early evening and the second early morning and a very long one at that. In actual fact the plane they used only had a few business class seats and the rest were economy! By the time we reached London and and 6 hours later home, we were exhausted from lack of sleep.Even though the cabin crew were good I would never want to travel with this airline again."
266,Amy A,4,"Just recently flown for the first time with Vietnam Airlines from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City, then from Ho Chi Minh up to Danang.<br><br>Both flights were bang on time, aircraft were clean, flight attendants were lovely. Meal and drinks were provided between HKG and Ho Chi Minh. Meal was ok as far as economy airline food goes. Drinks were provided on the domestic route. All in all would definitely fly Vietnam airlines again."
267,Ted G,5,This was the first time I had flown Vietnam Airlines and I was quite impressed.  They were very friendly and provided very good service.  The flights were on-time and we were able to confidently have time for a connection in Ho Chi Min City to Da Nang.  I would happily fly with Vietnam Airlines when I return to Vietnam.
267,Traveller88,5,"Flight from Bangkok to Ho Chi Min, was nice and smooth would definitely recommend this airline and will surly use them again"
267,Traveller88,5,"Great airline, very friendly cabin crew, will surly use them again and again, should have direct flights to Da Nang do 😆"
267,Jackie2106,3,"Have no complaints about the seating  (close together but aren’t they always in economy?). The staff were generally very pleasant. The planes was clean and the add ons ( pillow, blankets, slippers, shades) all very acceptable. The failures? Firstly no updates to notify us that the plane was boarding, fairly fundamental! We had pre booked our seats but on boarding we’re told they had been changed . We had specifically selected aisle seats but ended up next to window necessitating asking poor passenger on aisle to move regularly for our visits to the loo. Three of us were squashed in on three seats whilst other passengers had one to three seats.<br>I pre ordered vegetarian food and no problem in obtaining it but the food was very boring. Every pudding of the four meals was fresh fruit, every starter was salad ( my husband had far more varied choices. <br>Also surprised the movies selection was the same,on the return flight as per the outward flight. Usually this is different. Disappointing because we had seen our preferred choices on outward flight"
267,KenOC60,1,"For what is deemed to be a 13 hour flight, I was not impressed. Average seat comfort but they only gave us 1 small bottle of water and 2 very small plastic cups half filled thriughout the rntire flight. Surely water provision on a flight needs to be stepped up better than this.. also drinks availability was limited to one round for the entire flight (most airlines will give you 2/3).<br><br>Also .. one of the cabin crew members had a cold and I caught it part way through my vacation..probably so did others.. If you have a cold and are cabin crew.. please be considerate towards your customers and stay on the ground.<br><br>Won't be flying with them again."
268,Emma J,5,"I booked a flight with Vietnam Airways, It was a complicated booking as there was a stay over of 12 hours in Vietnam back to Heathrow so I needed assistance to allow a stay over of 2 days which made the booking complicated. Vietnam airways were extremely patient and organised all the booking for me over email. <br>Then life happened and work asked me to stay a few days extra, Vietnam airways customer service incredibly allowed all my flights to be cancelled with no hassal and refunded all the flights back to my card so i could rebook.<br>Huge thanks too Vietnam Airways and thanks to customer service for been so incredibly patient."
268,Runesyzygy,1,"Previously I thought Berlin airlines was number one but after 3  flight in 10 days with delays over 1 hrs (as I write this we are working on 4 hrs) I've decided Vietnam airlines takes the cake. 3 hrs before the flight they had a half hr delay, then 15 minutes prior to boarding they delay 1hr more, they then proceeded to load a full bus only to stay at the gate for 20 minutes only to take us back off until......who knows. With over 1MM miles around the world I've flown some losers but this is the worst. Funny the government claims 75% on time."
268,Taznoh,5,There is a really lot of space between seats (not like in charter flights) so it's comfy for taller people :-)<br><br>For all service classes is at least 20 kg checked baggage included in price!<br><br>Good experience with Android application when buying flight tickets and online check in.
268,Alexander R,3,"All would have been fine except my seat back control was broken with the seat constanty falling back on the person behind. The cabin crew seemed to have little concern or care about this, Makes you wonder about the rest of the aircraft.  In flight snacks and drinks poor.<br>Safety video completely inaudible and ignored by most everybody."
268,albiehodder,4,All went well and on time. Food choice was sufficient for all requirements. Staff were OK but English was poor.<br>Safety details were inadequate with children in the Isles on takeoff and landing and people getting luggage down even before the plane had reached the stand. <br>Value for money and modern equipment.
269,William H,5,"The airlines accept a passport or booking number, different to UK. They also accept your luggage if it's slightly over free of charge, but best is when booking in its free to sit together. On the aircraft you get a cool towel and drink, as all in Vietnam the people are so polite and helpful. The aircraft was immaculate and lots of seating room. We flew again to Saigon and the service was the same fabulous. If I am flying to Vietnam again I will fly direct with Vietnam Airlines. The UK services could learn so much as it made our travelling experience enjoyable, stress free and great staff."
269,kr1129,4,This airline is certainly a good 4 star. The crew were excellent and the food very good.<br><br>The seats ok and being sblr to lie flat the advantage of business class.<br><br>The films ok though not up to the minute.<br><br>Would recommend this airline as the flights were direct to Hanoi 10 hrs going 12 hours coming back.<br><br>On arrival back at Heathrow after 9 hours sleep on the plane felt fine to carry on with the day. <br><br>Worth the extra money. Business lounge ok.
269,Virginia A,4,Booked this flight on line while still in the USA. Quite difficult to get questions answered on line. Finally found US contact number! Have visa ready to speed up immigration process.
269,Ashley C,3,Aircraft is good and very comfortable seat. Cabin crew seem nice and flight is smooth landing. i'm really appreciate how they're so friendly and i have no compliant about. I prefer Economy is enough because it's only took me short flight from my country to Vietnam. they're also speak english well so i don't have to worries about anything if there's something happen unexpected.
269,fizzy1991,3,"There is no boarding “system “ in place for a smooth process.  People climbing over each other in the aisles to get to their row because boarding is from the back and front with no designation to which one you should use compared to your seat assignment.  The plane interior is warm and old looking.  The flight attendants are just ok, not the gracious type we expected having flown on Thai and Singapore airlines.  Maybe my expectations were too high."
270,splenetic,3,"The flight out was pretty good: reasonable comfort despite 9-seat wide configuration on the 787. Entertainment system is OK but film selection is a little limited. Snacks and drinks served promptly then meals at the beginning and end, with some snacks in between and endless soft drinks throughout. Flight back from HCMC was similar but not quite up to scratch: rows 26-40 were made to queue inexplicably for 20 minutes before boarding, and required to stand single file. Never did find out why the delay. Service went straight into supper, with no snacks and drinks first and it was 10 hours before we saw any more food. Also no sign of anyone serving water/soft drinks during the flight. You could go and ask for drinks or instant noodles, which is good, but it was definitely sub-standard service compared to the flight out."
270,Anne F,5,"We were lucky enough to get upgraded to Premium Economy for our flight to Hanoi. Food was excellent, as was the service and flight.  My only criticism was lack of good quality recent movie releases."
270,Amazingtraveler,4,"At the beginning of February , My family and I went to Viet Nam together. It was the first time I went there, so I was very excited.<br>The flight from Beijing to Hanoi, Viet Nam was great! Flight attendants had a good attitude to us , they were friendly and kind. But the speed of border checks is very slow.we waited for a long time.We arrived there in the evening . It was wet and hot ,so I only wore a shirt. We were hungry so we had some Vietnamese traditional food----Pho. It's a type of noodles. It was delicious! Then , we went to a supermarket to buy some bags of dry coffee. After that ,we went to a cafe near our hotel to have a cup of coffee, which is made by a special type . I fell amazed of it .After that ,we went back to the hotel to have a good sleep."
270,407willemw,5,"For the first time in my extensive travels across Asia, I left my passport in the back of the seat in front of me - only because I got a seat upgrade as I was sitting down.<br>I realised when I checked into the Hotel in Saigon.<br>After a frantic phone call from the hotel Concierge, VNA went to work and within an hour we had a call back to say that the passport had been found and was waiting for me back at the airport.<br>I can't compliment VNA highly enough. Very efficient and helpful."
270,M1473YFstephenh,5,"My wife and I flew to Vietnam and back with Vietnam Airlines in February. We chose them because they were the only carrier to fly direct to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). We also used them for the return flight from Hanoi. It turned out to be a very good choice. The Dreamliner aircraft which Vietnam Airlines now use for long haul flights was comfortable with plenty of leg room even in economy. The 11 hour flights were relaxing. The service on board was as good as anything we have encountered with friendly, young staff working extremely hard to ensure customer comfort. The food on board was also good. Each flight was also on time (in fact the return flight was early). This airline is clearly working very hard to improve its status and attract customers and from our experience they are succeeeding."
271,tootlepips,1,"during our tour we were on 7 vna flights,<br>from cdg to hanoi, from hanoi to da nang, from hue to ho chi minh city from phu quoc to ho chi minh city, from ho chi minh city to hanoi and from hanoi to cdg paris<br>all over the pilots are not fit for purpose, the captains english is bad, and they better should stick to driving a scooter.<br>our trip back home , our boarding passes wr printed in ho chi minh , after our flight amongst the cattle to hanoi , first security check, after a loooong time queuing it seemed the barcode on the boarding card couldn't be read, we had to go back to check in and start over again, we just managed to get on our flight to paris, the staff on the plane was terrible, the first drinks wr offered after 1 hour in the air, and at the same time dinner was served, the food..well we all know airline food is not the best, but this was not eatable !! never vietnam airlines again!!"
271,Edgar H,4,"Somethings you can improve quite easy and not much cost. It's the smiling, the attitude of well taking care passengers. Still."
271,Kari H,1,"We had booked a flight from Helsinki (Finnair) to DaNang via Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam Airlines). The ticket included both flights and our luggage was checked in all the way from Helsinki to DaNang.<br><br>However, after arriving in Ho Chi Minh and making the transfer between terminals we were told by Vietnam Airlines officials at the information desk that our luggage was not automatically transferred between the connecting flights although this was clearly indicated in the stickers attached to our luggage.<br><br>So we had to return back to the international terminal to collect our luggage and return back with them to the domestic terminal for check-in. Had the Vietnam Airlines flight been on time, we would have missed our transfer flight. <br><br>This kind of negligence and untrustworthiness in luggage services by Vietnam Airlines should not belong to the airline industry. It also calls for serious discussions between the two partners Finnair and Vietnam Airlines for due diligence and to integrate their travel services much better!"
271,Richard,5,"Travelling back from Vietnam to Australia, our flight was on time.<br>boarding was quick and easy.<br>Seats were comfortable although like all planes more leg room would have been nice. There was a good selection of movies and games etc .<br>The plane was clean and kept that way the entire trip. the staff were friendly and the meals very nice.<br>While away I had to email Vietnam airline several times for flight changes and confirmation, every response was friendly clear and helpful <br>We would happily fly Vietnam airlines again"
271,keith m,2,"For the first time ever decided to upgrade to premium economy and what a waste of money. During the tour we had 4 internal flights with the same airline in standard economy and the seats were far better.<br>The seat in normal upright position was very laid back making it uncomfortable ( I do suffer with back problems and normally never recline my seat). Seats had the TV screen and table in either armrest reducing the seat width considerably. Laid back in flight it was better (even for me) but when the seat in front is reclined it is impossible for the centre seat to get out without disturbing their neighbour. You have to pack away your TV screen and table for them to get out.<br>I know we have all heard the safety briefing many times but on this flight all there was was a small screen at the front of the cabin, no sound and the crew gesticulating in the air. Pre take-off checks were very poor and no action taken regarding passengers with considerable amounts of luggage laying loose at their feet. <br>TV screen kept turning itself off, choice of entertainment was very poor, had to have 3 sets of headphones before they worked but still unable to clearly hear the soundtrack. Return flight food was not edible.<br>Not a good experience."
272,Scottiehere,3,"We booked Premium economy for this flight which to be honest was slightly better than we had expected in terms of leg room and seat comfort and pricing was  pretty good! Now one of my in flight nightmares is not having the in-flight entertainment system working properly. Unfortunately this was the case, even though it was only one speaker in the headphones not working, when this is your only form of entertainment for 8 hrs, you want it to be working properly so this did unfortunately bring my score down. <br>Service in flight was very good. Food, well we all know what most plane food is like to be honest! <br>We had a very VERY tight connection even though we had booked the flight all the way through to our destination on one ticket. Departing almost 30 min late didn't help matters. The initial effort to meet us and fast track us through immigration, then wait with us to get our baggage and then walk us to the next terminal to get our connecting flight was excellent!! But unfortunately we were left  with no escort at a crucial moment of having 5 min left to board and a queue of over 1000 people waiting to get through security... we weren't hopeful of making the flight. We had to beg and plead with immigration to allow us to jump the queue and even then no one seemed to care very much at all. Still to this day we don't know how we made it to the gate as they were literally closing the plane door....but there were others who were transiting with us who weren't so lucky who didn't make the flight.<br>This made the start of our holiday somewhat stressful and not something we would want to experience again. The thing is we did try to find out information about the connection and if we really would have time and if someone would be meeting us but the information I got was incorrect (direct from the airline) so there did seem to be somewhat a lack of communication between the airline and passengers as to the exact process of what was going to happen with regards to the transit process once we landed. <br>We wouldn't have a problem flying with Vietnam Airlines again but as mentioned previously we would NEVER take this same flight again with such a manic connection.<br>Overall my score would really be 3.5/5 if i could score by halves."
272,Inkstander,4,"Vietnam Airlines is developing a strong following of loyal customers because the quality of service is better than other airlines flying between Europe and Asia at a cheaper price. Criticisms of its service are often ignorant: eg. One review complains that they were only fed twice during the flight, but that is true for all airlines flying between the two regions."
272,Anna O,5,"Quick flight from Bangkok to Hanoi. Speedy boarding, plenty of legroom in economy class, delicious unexpected meal and drinks included in price of less than two hours flight. Fully enjoyed."
272,John H,4,"A lovely flight home after two weeks travelling around Vietnam.  It was the fourth flight that we had taken with them in the two weeks.  London to Hanoi, Hanoi to Penang, Penang to Ho Chi Minh and then home to London.<br><br>All of the flights were on time."
272,fraser_macleod,3,"We travelled from Ho Chi Minh City to London Heathrow. The flight took 13.5 hours and we only got fed twice. The first time was 45 minuets after take off at 01.30am                Who wants to eat at that time  The second time was 2 Hours before we landed, That is a long time between meals with no other service.Having no wifi on board is a bit behind the times.   Perhaps a rethink of how to look after your passengers is required"
273,Kevin Wilson,4,Very good service on our flights to and from vietnam. food was good and drinks served when  requested
273,Angela S,3,"First time we,d flown Vietnam air,we paid extra for economy plus and liked the extra room. The food was fine as flight meals go . On board entertainment good a reasonable choice of films to view. Staff were helpful but not especially friendly.Not a bad experience for an 11 hour flight when the flying is the least enjoyable part of your holiday."
273,platossydney,4,"We asked for exit row seats and got them (not on the way back when I was deemed to be too old for the regulations .... just 70 ....), so we had great legroom and easy access to facilities.  <br><br>Service overall was not overly friendly but adequate, the food quite good, and drinks were replenished. The female flight attendant for our section found it hard to smile, in contrast to the others we could observe. <br><br>The plane and the toilets were kept clean throughout the flight although one of the toilets was not in service for the whole flight."
273,Brian T,3,"i have flown Vietnam Air many times when I am in SE Asia. the attendants are friendly enough, the food is not so good. Flights from Gateway cities are ok,. The seating is somewhat cramped on in country flights, tall people beware."
273,Paula G,2,"Flew Heathrow - Ho Chi Min economy class. Flight was fine except half the plane including us had no inflight entertainment for a 12 hr 15 min flight . <br>We had booked premium economy for the return flight for a little more comfort and luxury . However , this was not to be the case . <br>I think the main problem is that the flight attendants barely speak English . They have set sentences they say but if you speak back to them they haven’t a clue .<br>While we were still climbing from take off they started serving dinner . No pre dinner drink or packet of nuts . <br>Two choices . Beef or chicken . I don’t eat meat but eat fish . Was told I should have ordered a vegetarian meal so I took the chicken and ate the fruit and bread roll . She asked me what I’d like to drink . Glass of wine please . No ! Juice or water ! Strange as others had wine . My husband managed to get me an eye bath of wine . While passengers were eating their chicken and beef they served coffee then cleared . My husband noted on the menu you could request a sandwich , which he did . Was told they would serve them later . That was the last we saw of any staff till 90 minutes before landing . Basically they they took the night off. <br>My husband queried the sandwich and she said they’d run out but in the galley we could see the flight attendants eating sandwiches. <br>Seats were large and comfortable . <br>12 hours thirsty and hungry ."
274,JnVSydney,5,"Checkin and boarding went smoothly everything on time, the Plane an, A320, was very clean, however the seats are tight, so we went the exit row option (at checkin), the plane wasnt very full, however no was allowed to move, (which isnt a bad thing), The 1hr 30 flight went smoothly. Food service, (there was one), offering a lunch pack, sammie etc. Drinks service, much better, (than shorter flights) selection of non alcoholic drinks. All in all it was a nice way to finish our experience with this airline."
274,mayfly,2,"plain on business class far more than middle east airlines.<br>- good for 1-2-1 but seat getting old<br>- movies choices limited and old<br>- plain service from crews, not pay much attention. Most walked pass with out notice at least should glance to every passengers to see if they need something. it's biz class not much seat! i gotta walk to catering space for a bottle of water. and signature drinks was good only 1st glass, 2nd one like water and ice getting melt.<br>- dessert i chose run out as they come from 1 row and i was in 7 of 8 row, not a big deal but biz class i expect more choices. if your local dessert no one want or familiar u should add more international dessert ppl can eat."
274,TanyaWx,5,"So far I’ve taken two flights, both with Vietnam Airlines. One from Hanoi to Da nang, then the second 5 days later, from Da nang to Ho Chi Minh. <br>Currently been in Ho Chi Minh four days and tomorrow I take my third flight from Saigon (Ho Chi Minh) to Seam reap. <br>The airline is great and organised, the planes are clean and crew helpful.. so far two great flights."
274,GWYN33,3,"I looked forward to this flight - it was the start of a 2 week adventure motorcycling tour of Vietnam. I was looking forward to flying in the Dreamliner which was an added bonus. Everything seemed to go well at Heathrow and my bag disappeared along a conveyer belt. All aboard I settled for the flight. Dreamliner was a little disappointing after all the hype, leg room was just the same as any other scheduled airline's aircraft as were the noise levels. Not a big deal really other than that no real complaints about either flight inbound or outbound. My bag went missing between Heathrow and Hanoi and remained so for nearly a week - this marred my trip, disappointed that there was no apology from the airline, even a class upgrade on the way home would have left me a little happier, but this was not forthcoming. All in all, not a bad flying experience, but customer service was a little below expectation."
274,Angela L,5,"Although only a short flight check in good, aircraft clean, staff friendly.  Flight was on time and the baggage was checked on and off efficiently"
275,john O,5,"It was a long flight, but very comfortable on the Dreamliner plane. The air hostesses were excellent and very pleasant."
275,ray m,5,"For a long haul flight ( 13 hours ), it was relatively comfortable with some of the best airline food we have ever had.The Dreamliner is a typical long haul aircraft but the inflight entertainment is excellent with a large choice of subjects to choose from.Overall a pleasant experience."
275,749vanesab,3,We used this airline twice. We had almost 2 hours delay from HCMC to Nha Trang. You can have up to 20 kg checked baggage and they also serve coffe/tea .
275,leonspain,3,"Not quite got the Business Class idea ! No names , no finesse - just  avery average service not what I expected ! Seat showed its age and the whole Cabin was dull , not my choice to return to !"
275,Paul S,4,"We were impressed with the efficiency of this airline and the friendliness of the staff, our flight went on time and the business class section was good although the seating was a little tired."
276,alanapw,4,This is rapidly becoming a high quality service. Flying the Dreamliner on this route.Very solicitous cabin crew beginning in my view to reach the standards of Emirates.  It is not cheap largely because of the huge tax the Vietnam government puts on the seats.<br>Internal flights on this airline using Economy are reasonably good and comfortable. I have flown 6 sectors like this in the last year and have not had a bad experience.
276,cambo2009,5,"No complaints here, great airline to fly with.  Bit dearer but it is a full service airline that includes meals, drinks, entertainment &amp; baggage.<br>Will be flying with them again this September direct to Hanoi."
276,robincornah,4,Crew very friendly and efficient and food very good. On line check in and seat selection was scrappy wi th no decent ph one back up to call - only on office who knew nothing.
276,Allison T,4,"This airline is more expensive than others, but oh, so nice!  The crew was friendly and kind, the legroom and headroom were great (our group were 5""4"" to 6' in height), the food for a short flight was fine and the plane was clean and welcoming.  I would fly with them again anytime!"
276,ged229,4,"OK, the good stuff first. Airline staff very good, attentive and generally a good bunch. Food and wine on the flight both very good. Flown them a lot and the planes are 95%+ on time. <br><br>Check in at Shanghai to HCM is a long queue even for business class as they double up with Sky Priority. Staff at Pudong not employed by VNA so they don't really care too much. If you see someone with a VNA name tag, grab them and they will get you checked in quicker over at the Hanoi check in lane, which does for some reason, have its own business check in. First World problem I know.<br><br>The movies on the flight are limited in number, so recommend you load one or two to your lap top.<br><br>Overall would recommend this airline though, as the FF program is pretty good too, and unlike some other airlines, seems to have plenty of reward flights available whenever you want one."
277,Manny M,4,"All Flights that Vietnam Airlines controlled, were terrific and clean and efficient, and the flight crews were top notch.  Our last leg of the flight was contracted with Air China, and as such, we were unable to pre-pick our seats.  They smiled constantly and said, ""sorry, but nothing we can do."" The flight was a twelve hour nightmare for me, as I had to stand for nearly six hours, to avoid my two neighbors from both sleeping on top of me!!!  When I tried explaining the situation to the flight crew, they smiled and said sorry...  By far, my most miserable flight ever.  That situation will never happen again, as we will not book flights where we cannot book all of our seats."
277,antonseiler,4,"Good service, good seats, good entetainment program,<br>no peoblem with check in,<br>economy class ok, but always very crowded"
277,verriberry,5,"After reading many negative reviews on the concurrents of Vietnam Airlines I decided that it’s worth paying couple of more bucks to have piece in mind and booked 2 flights. One from Nha Trang to Da Nang and another from Da Nang to Hanoi. Both flights were on time. Service was good and airplane was recent. Our flight to Hanoi was on Tet (new year) and they give to all of us a small gift - rice cake, something typical eaten in Vietnam on that day. Nice gesture."
277,Richard H,4,"We worried about travelling economy with a little one, however we were pleasantly surprised and £3k better off, only down side was the food which was not great, although edible, just take some food from the airport"
277,cherlylh,4,Comfortable enough seats. Plentiful of drinks if needed. Clean toilets and plane. Some meals were okay others not so but that's plane food. Pleasant Stewart's.
278,Helmut B,4,"Although it was a short flight and almost full the service was efficient and I was satisfied with check-in as well as food and drinks considering the price paid for. One other good thing has been the punctuality, this goes for both flights in- and outbound."
278,Renee P,3,"We travelled to Paris via HCMC  with 2 adults and 2 kids (8yrs and 11yrs). I wasn't expecting much as reviews were a bit hit and miss but we had good flight on each leg. Food was generally ok, except between HCMC and Paris where I was very glad we had eaten at the airport so I wasn't hungry! Husband said the meal was inedible. Breakfasts were very Asian and limited selection of non-noodle choices but that is to be expected. Seats are comfy with 3-3-3 layout which doesn't really suit a family of 4 but we did 2-2 which worked. Onboard entertainment was fine, headphones provided. Toiletries were also provided (slippers, toothbrush/paste and eye mask). Service was ok and toilets were kept clean. Only real complaint is the loooonnngg layover both directions in HCMC- 6hrs to Europe and 16hrs from. HCMC airport is tiny and we had trouble entertaining ourselves. Got visas so we could leave airport on way back. Vietnam Airlines provides you with a meal voucher for long layover but restaurant we  could use it at was mostly out of food and what was left was pretty bland. Overall for the price 4 people return Melb to Paris for under $4k in September - can't complain and would fly them again."
278,Alexandra D,5,"Vietnam Airlines are fabulous, we upgraded from Hi Chi Minh City to Sydney for a small price. The food and service are fabulous"
278,vinzware,4,"The plane was really comfortable. food and beverage good and they give you free wine as well. <br><br>i'm travelling from Vietnam to Jakarta. if you are looking for a one way flight from Vietnam to Jakarta, Vietnam Airlines is your best choice!. <br><br>Price was decent not expensive."
278,gutygroup,5,"Great airline. Felt like it was first class!  We were fed, staff were quick to ensure our comfort, lots of drink service.  Flight was clean, and comfortable.  They also spoke English which was an added bonus. <br><br> Wet professional would absolutely recommend!"
279,GARY N,4,A321 planes a little older but service very acceptable. Plane was delayed but no different than being in North America. Understand prices better than North America but not sure how much as we booked through tour. Airport in Hanoi very clean and modern.
279,Geoff,5,We have been using this airline for the last 5 years. And over the years we have seen a good improvement. In the service and the airplanes.. We fly about 4 times a year a mostly fly premium economy.... They also have a lotus airmiles card which to be honest can be a bit hit and miss weather you get your airmiles or not.. But it is inproveing alot.. All in all its a good airline and yes we would recommend them....
279,Vietnam Lovely Travel,5,"I flew a night flight, but it was right time, no delay, the crew was very helful and friendly.<br>Seat was also comfortable.<br>Thank you Vietnam Airline!"
279,Teddy N,1,We were running late because of a car accident on the road to the airport. But not too late we made it in time before the flight 30 minutes . The representative from the airline said we’re late OK .  Then I asked Is there any other flight going back to Ho Chi Minh City she said yes 3 more but she has to check the availability. Then  representative from the airline told me that I have to pay again to fly back to Ho Chi Minh City. I was like?  I missed my flight why do you have to pay another flight to Ho Chi Minh City  Full price for two people I was like wow .  I asked her the plane is still here it’s delayed for two hours can I get on the plane No checking in time is over she said <br> Worst airline I have ever used and yes I paid full price for two more tickets to go back Ho Chi Minh City
279,jim t,4,Have flown Vietnam airlines many times international and domestic with no problem. However on this recent flight my partner and I were sat in front of a guy who coughed the entire trip. Next day we went down with flu and mine was further complicated with pneumonia. This has so far ruined five days of our trip. No fault of the airline but will be wearing a mask on all internal flights from now on!
280,Roger N,3,"Airports nicely laid out and relaxed. Boarding well organised and information clear. However food had no vegetarian offering - when I asked I was told I should have requested this in advance - fair enough but only option I could see was check in 2; hours prior to take off and then only seat selection, <br><br>There is nothing at Ho Chi Minh Airport to tell you your collected baggage will be crosschecked against your boarding card before exit - nor that there are separate checks and exits for different flight providers - hence we were in wrong queue and had to then go to the back of the right queue."
280,_john_elliott1,4,"crew were friendly and helpful, travelling with 16 month grand daughter and we had no problems, food was good for airline food. travelling with baby we had more leg more but bassinet took up some room"
280,Fernand D,4,I was quite scare to fly with this company but my experience has been very positive. <br>Staff has been nice and helpfull. Plane was clean. Food was ok for a sort flight but the beverage offer was really too short .
280,JM5975,5,We went Premium Economy and could not fault it. Service was excellent.<br>Seats were big and wide. We were in the back row of PE and with the persons seat in front laid back....you wouldn't even know. Very comfortable seats and flight. We have just re booked to go again this July.
280,gocegd,4,It was a short flight but we felt like we were in First class.  We are a family of 5. 2 adults and 3 children.  Very good service. The plane  Tv/ entertainment wasn't the latest on this flight but the service was great.
281,nealmarriott,5,"The trip undertaken provided 4 flights with Vietnam Airlines namely LHR to HoChi Minh, HoChi Minh to Sydney, Sydney to Hanoi and Hanoi to LHR. We were introduced to the airline by our broker and immediately took up the recommendation given the competitive price. Seat reservations were made at the time of booking. On the day of departure we were welcomed onboard by a youthful and professional team who could not do enough to assist you and delivering very your needs th4oughout the flight. The fleet of aircraft are Dreamliners therefore a known level of comfort is provided. Fair to say a good experience with an airline that I would have no hesitation in using again and recommending"
281,Claus S,5,"I remember, back in 1995, I was on business in Vietnam and flex from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang on an old, second-hand plane the Vietnamese airline had parchase from former East Germany. There was no bathroom door. It was simply gone.<br><br>Now, having returned to Vietnam 23 years later, we were in for a most pleasant surprise. Vietnam Airlines was almost exclusive flying Boeing 787 Dreamliners on their international routes. Needless to say, the plane was extremely clean. The service and food were outstanding. We had flown from Houston to Beijing on Air China, and I must say, Vietnam Airlines was as good overall, if not a notch better."
281,sally b,4,Food was good - service friendly. Cabin was Nice and clean. Seats were comfortable. Entertainment centre was adequate - I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br>We chose it to fly direct without a stopover and was glad we did
281,CANADIANOLDIES,5,"Flew on this airline 3 times within Vietnam. They were always on time, the service was exceptional, we were always served a meal even though the flight was only 2.5 hours long  in some cases. Clean air crafts, easy check in , lots of space for carry on luggage. We were very pleased and impressed with this airline. Better than some that we have at home!"
281,alexanderJasminVienna,4,"Our first flight with Vietnam Airlines, good service, no delay, a good value for money, a bit rattled at the takeoff and landing"
282,Pam A,5,Excellent service at all levels. Enjoyed using this airline for many segments within Vietnam. Service is  fabulous as compared to US airlines. Quite a pleasurable experience.
282,MaJenks,4,"We treated ourselves to premium and were not disappointed. A good level of recline in a comfy seat, with two types of foot rest. The seat also had the head rest wings that you can pull forward, which give you a good level of head support. Service good, but I have to say the food wasn't that great."
282,LE48Uk,5,"check in is fast and efficient, service, food and drink on board is very good. The seat layout on the dreamliner is excellent."
282,Ultimate Family Travels,5,"the boarding procedure was smooth and easy, very nice to let families first, help a lot having kids, the flight was nice, and easy, the plane was clean and comfortable and the crew were nice and helpful"
282,LondonExplorer99,4,"Booked 3 flights through Bangkok Airways, but this leg was covered by Vietnam Airlines. First flight with VA and certainly no complaints whatsoever. A two hour flight on an airbus, and a hot meal and drink included. Smooth, comfortable, good service. I will happily fly with VA again."
283,shifa akbar,5,If you have any meal preferences please let them know 24 hours ahead if not  you might not receive it.<br><br>It was very comfortable and the staff were very friendly. Would recommend the airlines.
283,John C,4,During our holiday we had four flights with Vietnam Airlines and they were unremarkable except they left on time and the cabin crew were pleasant.<br>The food was OK but not special but one only gets what one pays for!
283,Tistru,3,"Both our flights were full (with just a few seats left).  So in economy you really feel hemmed in.  In flight movies were good but the food was very average and by the time the food came towards the back of the plane there was no choice.  Once on the plane the food and drink service was well over an hour wait.  Once people had been served, things did settle down a bit and you could then get another drink.  As the seats are all in rows of three, someone is always trying to climb over someone else and my husband and I have decided that next time we will buy three seats, cheaper than business, and will give us a little more space to stretch out.  Would we fly with them again, possibly, it has to be better than Jetstar and the flight times are at a better time to get to accommodation etc."
283,204beatar,5,The busuness class was pleasing comfort-wise. The screen didn’t work so I couldn’t watch anything but I was offered to change seats. I didn’t because it was a night flight so it didn’t matter. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was great. Vietnamese specialities together with cocktails designed especially for the airlines as I understood.  Bathroom was clean at all times! In general it was a very pleasant experience and I  recommend Vietnamese Airlines to anyone!
283,Eric D,3,Flight departed a bit late and there was some turbulence but the pilots handled it perfectly. Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Staff was efficient and professional.
284,Sammy G,1,"Flown 3 times with VA in the past 3 weeks and each flight has been pleasant with good food and excellent flight crews.<br><br>The one star review comes from retrieving our bag on the final flight covered in urine. This in of itself would not warrant a 1 star review however after contacting Vietnam Airlines about the issue the customer service has been 0 stars. A customer service focused business should be judged on service when there is an issue, and Vietnam Airlines came up short."
284,Manuel M,3,"I booked with a 15 kilos allowance and and a 7 kilos hand carry. I did not go shopping and I only have a backpack. On checking in, it weighed 8 kilos and was told to check it in. I asked if it can be just carried on in the cabin since I have the 22 kilos limit anyways and I am not checking in anything. They insisted to check it in. When I am going to pick it up arriving at Saigon, I found out that my perfume of 40ml(Hugo Boss) and my sunglasses that I bought in Singapore are missing. I presumed the perfume is not allowed(but I doubt it since it is within the limit), but the sunglasses as well--I was robbed. I don't know, but to think of a very simple common sense application could have prevented lost of things, why cant I put it in the cabin and have to check in if I have the limit(22 kilos) and it will go the same plane anyways? and it is not that big difference. Who do I blame for the lost? Well, lesson learned!"
284,DavideP76,5,Excelllent flight company. Quick and efficient at land activities. Modern and clean airplanes. Confortable flights.
284,dingob095,5,"Great flight, 787 was clean and comfortable, leg room was ok. Aircrew were very attentive.food was good."
284,Keiron R,5,"My wife and I flew premium economy and can’t fault the seating, staff or service we received. We were made feel welcome and nothing was a problem. The seats were terrific considering the price we paid for the upgrade from economy. The food service and choice was to our liking and all went smoothly."
285,ESVincent,3,VN airlines has been working to improve its services and the evidence is promising. The 11 hr flight was proficiently handled. Boarding was smooth and the business class was reasonable spacious ( we arent talking Emirates here) but more than pleasant. Food service was good and there was a good media package. Cabin staff were friendly but a little work in in progress is still needed. Overall a positive experience and I would fly with them again
285,Hanh Van Pham,5,"Flight both ways between Hanoi and Saigon with Vietnam Airlines. Basically I felt satisfied: on time and convenient. Vietnam Airlines deserves to be the best choice for domestic flights, in-flight hot meals provided gives even bonus point. However, the aircraft machine was too noisy, prevented passengers from hearing the announcements. PA and safety instructions should have been louder. Rather than this, nothing to complain!"
285,Abdullah B,4,"The service was, the flight was good, cabin crews were friendly. I didn't eat because my Muslim meal wasn't delivered to no fault of the airlines. Lao air sold the ticket and after multiple email communications with their representatives, I didn't receive any confirmation of the meal. <br>It was an A321 that didn't have any personal entertainment system installed."
285,mike s,5,What a great way to hop scotch an otherwise difficult region to get around.  Everything about the three flights I was on was excellent
285,beverly s,5,"What a breath of fresh air , great service , friendly staff very tidy , food was good and had flavour , given bottle of water for flight and came round regularly to ask if we needed more , <br><br>Great leg room and comfortable seats"
286,Chelsea,4,"On our flight there were no Tv's,  very strange for an international flight and 4 hours long. The flight was an hour delayed. However, the food and service was good. The airplane was clean and comfortable. It was not a full flight so we got 3 seats to ourselves - whoohoo!"
286,avimanes M,5,"Even though it was a short flight (2.5 hours), it was a very comfortable airplane, with enough space between the seats, personal screens, good food, and great service"
286,David,5,"While in Vietnam, I choose to travel with Vietnam Airlines. They were on schedule, had clean planes, and very friendly staff on and off the plane. They were very cordial and full of smiles while working. I enjoyed flying with Vietnam Airlines and will continue to fly with them when I have a chance to fly in the country again."
286,Andrew S,4,"Nice clean plane, short flight so no entertainment on board or meals. The uniforms the stewards wore were very smart."
286,Tamriko A,4,The flight was on time. The seats on the plane are tiny but luckily we only had 1 hour flight. Service was ok. No problem with luggage etc I would recommend for short distance flights.
287,Ermmmm85,1,"Yesterday I had one of the most shocking experience I ever had. I arrived in BKK airport at 6 am from Milan and my flight to Hanoi was 6 hours later. I spent some time napping, eating until it was time to reach the gate (F3). I gave my passport and bording pass to a lady who scanned it and let me through the preboarding area holding my passport with many others as, next to her, a guy was manually checking and putting passport details into a computer. Our passport got checked and the bording card was filled with some details and given to the security agent to then give it back to me. After the security agent checked the picture, the customer service agent took the passport back to scan it (in the passport reader). He put it on the scanner and when he removed it from the machine he completely tore the first page from the passport (which originally was intact and not even slightly damaged as in Italy they are quite strict on that and I would have not been allowed flying otherwise). The customer service agent did not say anything and put it to one side. I was shocked and did not say a word waiting for him either to apologize or just tell me something. Nothing. The Vietnam Airline representative than came to me and said I was not allowed to fly with the passport in that condition. As if it was my fault. I immediately informed him the passport had been tore by the customer service agent and when I told him exactly what had happened, he went to speak to the customer service desk but the conversation was in thai so I could not understand. What really upset me was that the agent completely ignored me and at any point apologized for what he had done, he literally could not be careless. I immediately contacted the italian embassy, that informed me I had to go there to get a new document. But the problem was the airport staff were not sure I could have gone through immigration. After 2 hours as they were trying to contact immigration and ask one lady started repairing my passport with salitape to go through immigration (all filmed with my camera). When I went trhough immigration she said to me she was happy as what she had done was a but cheeky, so not only they damaged my passport and ruined my whole holiday they even put me at risk by doing something cheeky resulting me in being sent back to Italy. In all this Vietnam airlines dis not assist me in any way as they said it was airport staff although, whoever is at the gate,  represents the airline and should be accountable for any mistake. When I asked Vietnam Airline representative if I would have get a refund or transfer to another flight when my passport would have been re issued he said NO, although he signed a statement confirming that a customer service desk had damaged my passport. So I lost my holiday, my flight, my passport for one member of airport staff who was representing you who was negligent and amongst the most unprofessional. And when I contavted the contact centre first they said they could not go further after checking as they found out it had been not your staff but the airport service agent (who was boarding YOUR flight), then told me that their staff said my passport was already like this...a bit contradictory considering I have a statement from your staff and videos proofing they had damaged it. UNBELIAVABLE!"
287,Rob R,4,"Quick check in and then to QANTAS Lounge(Reviewed separately). Flight boarding on time and greeted by lovely friendly flight attendants. Sitting in Row 4 D. G. We were not impressed with the Herringbone Seating on the angle, felt strange. Much prefer facing direct front. Nice new 350=9 Seats were comfortable but couldn't sleep due to said side angle. Just felt strange and we have flown all types of aircraft with V.A. in business. Drinks and towels handed out and ready for take off, smooth as and once seat belts sign off staff offered menus of very high class. Also alcoholic drinks available. Very good meal of rack of lamb, fruit, cheeses and coffee. Enjoyed the flight apart from said angled seats. Great landing( any landing safely is a good one). Would recommend Business Class especially if going to Europe. All in all, very efficient, English speaking staff that catered to your needs."
287,antonia251238,3,"I am only 5'6"" and I was not comfortable long haul. The seats were narrow and there was very little padding in the back of the seat. Every time the back of the seat was knocked or something put in the pocket, it felt as though it was being pushed directly against me. Value for money was good and food fine but next time I will spend the extra money and go for a different airline"
287,Jane W,5,"Planned our own itinerary from Hanoi to Saigon and found Vietnam Airlines the only direct flight from Heathrow. Last minute change of plane but didn’t affect us at all. Outbound flight good but marred by quite a few noisy children running up and down (Economy). Hence a bit sleep deprived when we arrived in Hanoi. Flight home from Saigon (Premium Economy) was brilliant - the 14 hours flew by. Plenty of space, nice blankets, food, etc. Didn’t find the choice of entertainment brilliant, but was ok. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.<br>Also took two internal flights (Hanoi-Hue and Da Nang to Saigon). All the above were good and on time.<br>Book early and grab a bargain. Would recommend this airline."
287,Lesa S,4,"Great service, efficient and fast check in for both flights<br><br>We flew Hong Kong to Hanoi - fantastic, on-time, great communication from staff and flight desk and a meal and wine was even served on this short flight! Smooth flight. Very nice<br><br>Hanoi - Hue - fantastic, on-time. great communication from staff and flight deck - just beverages but it was less then an hour and expected. Smooth flight except our luggage was completely ruined and ""sort of"" taped up. We asked where we could go put a baggage claim in and we were ushered outside by a Vietnam rep who did not speak English or understand what we were asking so that opportunity flew out the window. We missed the 7 day window to claim online as we were busy travelling and its my fault as I forgot. <br><br>So other then that - great!"
288,John France,5,"We live in France, our first time flying out of Paris CDG,stayed at the Sheraton CDG directly above Terminal 2, checked in at Vietnam Airlines priority access through immigration and security, on boarding the aeroplane we were given fresh face towels and a glass of bubbly, followed by 12 hrs of pampering. We arrived in Hanoi the next morning totally refressed. Looking forward to many flights on Vietnam Airlines"
288,Dilip P,3,"I have taken multiple fights on Vietnam Airlines. All of them were very good, however this was disappointing flight. Staff was not courteous or friendly. It seemed that staff did not get along with each other."
288,Dilip P,4,This was my first time using Vietnam airlines. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Aircraft was clean and comfortable seats
288,Linda B,4,This flight was better than a recent flight I was on to Dubai with emirates. The crew was friendly efficient always ready to help with drinks etc . This was a. Very nice experience
288,Nicolai M,5,"We flight two times Vietnam Airlines from Can Tho to Phu Quoc and Saigon to Bangkok (as code share with Etihad).<br>Both flies were comfortable even the flight to Phu Quoc with Dashq. Especially the transfer to Bangkok was a top flight, enough leg space, a good meal and big seats. Compared to the connecting flights with Etihad it was the best part of the trip from Saigon to Dusseldorf.<br>No idea why Etihad is five stars and Vietnam Airlines just four stars."
289,Philip L,5,"Another flight among many on VN Airlines. Efficient boarding, departing on time, landing on time. Caring and courteous pilots, attentive flight attendants."
289,HKinsey,4,"Check in was swift and easy, with a very friendly checkin guy.<br>Plane was comfortable with good leg room. Very nice snack served, plus drinks<br>Would use again"
289,taragautam,5,"I thought this airlines is just ok. But when I enter the flight it was good. Even in 1 hour 30 min flight, they gave good food with choice and plenty of drinks. Staffs were good and flight was great."
289,Jim0,4,"We got to air port, but it seems I had not paid.  They sent us to a ticket counter and they got us on an earlier flight.  Since I'm handicapped, they escorted me to the plane.  The seats were far enough apart that I had room.  It was less than 2 hours, but they gave us a snack and drink.  In HCM, they had a stairs . I don't really like them, but they had a square service bus that I could get in easily.  They brought me to gate and took me off with a wheelchair.  Great.  Then took us to a taxi and told them where we wanted to go.  Great !"
289,JnVSydney,3,"After still reeling from not being able to check our bags all the way through from Phu Quoc to Siem Reap via Saigon - AND having to walk in the heat from the domestic terminal, to the international terminal, things got much better at check in, with a very helpful staff member. We chose exit row seats which added to our sense of well being. Boarding was going smoothly until the bus was delayed, and then we waited in the bus on the tarmac for 10 minutes in the heat and an extra 45 mins on the plane. We think we missed our take off slot due to the bus delay on the tarmac.  There was no info provided - just sit and wait, and wait, and wait.  After eventual takeoff (15 minutes prior to when we were supposed to land in Siem Reap), the flight went smoothly, however the inflight service could be a lot better than coke or water - even a coffee would be better or a snack - it’s only a 45 minute flight time - but closer to 2 hours in the end.  Due to late departure we arrived in Siem Reap at the same time as 3 other massive plane loads of people - Arrivals/Immigration/Baggage all chaotic as a result.  Shame - as Vietnam Airlines usually has a solid product. as a result we can still only give them no better than an average"
290,Jonathan S,5,"I have very long legs, so we flew ""Premium Economy"" which as superb legroom and six seats abreast rather than nine or ten in Economy.<br><br>However, we also took three domestic flights within Vietnam, and to my amazement I had just about enough legroom in Economy Class. Vietnam Airlines seems to provide more legroom in Economy Class than most Western airlines.<br><br>I was very impressed and would happily fly with them again."
290,JnVSydney,3,"Previous times we have flown with these guys it has been really good, however with this flight they change our flight three times, in the end we had a 4 hour wait in HCMC airport with no care attitude from, the airlines. <br><br>However the real let done was even though we booked all the way through to siem reap, the staff was unable as a matter of policy to look at our cambodia visas and check us and our baggage all the way through. This is something we would expect from a low cost carrier, not a full member of the Sky Team alliance and a full service airline.<br><br>Pretty average all round"
290,Chris L,5,First time with this airline and was pleasantly surprised. Took off and landed on time. The aircraft was clean and the crew pleasant and efficient.  In flight food was some of the best I have experienced.<br><br>Would not hesitate to fly with them again.
290,EwanMac,5,"Modern aeroplane (Dreamliner), attentive service, good food and as large a space (legroom) in Economy as I have ever experienced. What's not to like? We were very impressed with this airline."
290,Airstar,4,"It was such a pleasant flight with Vietnam Airlines route Singapore - HCMC on Feb 1 2019. Cabin crews were very professional and accommodating. Even it was a late evening flight but crew always smiled and treated you well.<br><br>They have improved so much (ground service, cabin crew, food). Wishing VNA and all the staffs a very Happy Lunar New Year and great success!"
291,Muhammad Fadhly J,5,Clean Interior. Friendly Cabin crew. Served nice meals. Quite impressed with their service. Kudos . Will gladly take Vietnam airline again .
291,JoolsGlasgowUK,4,Convenient direct flight from London to Vietnam. Travelled in premium economy and whilst the legroom was a bonus the seat was not the best. I did not sample the inflight entertainment but most passengers did . Food acceptable and early arrival in both directions.
291,JnVSydney,5,"Once again we chose exit row, which we are so glad we did, everyone else looked a little crammed in. Overall a no fuss flight, from checkin to baggage collection all went smothly, we actually left early."
291,Ruben_Heather,4,"I only started flying with Vietnam Airlines last year when we moved to Ho Chi Minh, but I must say I have been impressed with their punctuality and service.  I fly normally twice a week with them and out of the 40 plus flights I've taken only 2 were delayed.<br><br>This flight was no exception, we boarded exactly on time and landed slightly early.  As we were just going to Phu Quoc for the weekend and it was an early flight, I upgraded the whole family to business class just to make it easier to travel with the children and for them to get an extra hours sleep on the flight.  It worked really well!<br><br>Out of the other airlines in Vietnam I must say I prefer Vietnam airlines."
291,SENTHAO,4,"Traveled from Saigon to Hai Phong. Check-in experience was good, however the check-in counter staff was unfriendly. I had 2kg extra, totsl 22kg, she made me to pay for 2 kg at 55.000 per kg. Without paying she refused to give boarding pass. If it was 10kg extra i can understand. If the flight is delay for 30minutes or one hour, they do nothing, all must be reciprocal. Sure compare to other 2 dpestic airlines VN airlines certainly better. The new young staff are not very couteous but abide by book."
292,hunglow,4,friendly staff.    clean planes.   seats are a bit tight.   when person in front of me reclined it put the tray and therefore my laptop right in my face.  prices are same as everyone pretty much. would fly again.
292,Jennifer F,3,"This was our second flight on Vietnam Airlines, the first having been Sydney to ho Chi Minh City a few days earlier.  We have experienced business class on long haul flights with about 8 different airlines and I’d have to say this was the worst of those.  The food was not great, the champagne was flat and the bed was quite uncomfortable.  Also the business class cabin configuration was awkward for a couple- we could not really see each other or communicate easily with each other.  On the flight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City the Business cabin had only 6 people and yet they failed to coordinate our meals so that the timing of each of our meals was that we each ate separately. Having said all those negatives, the cabin staff were generally sweet and helpful and the price of the trip was lower than other airlines."
292,Richard F,4,"We found Vietnam Airlines to be professional and efficient, planes were clean and relatively modern. Crew were efficient, polite and non intrusive.<br>Food was standard fare for flights but a choice of dishes available from a brief menu.<br>In flight entertainment ( long haul international only) was extensive and modern with great selection of both western and Asian films and tv.<br>Overall a good service and the only one we could find direct from London to Hanoi. Also flew with them twice internally and they were just as efficient and clean.<br>Would definitely use them again."
292,JnVSydney,5,"We chose exit row seats, If the urge struck, we could have done yoga in the oodles of space we had in front of us and there was a nice hot lunch with, however, a woeful drinks selection (water or coke/tea/coffee - the country runs on caffeine). But it did the job - plane went up, 2 hours later plane went down with nothing untoward in between. The staff we friendly with a no fuss attitude, looking to fly with them again."
292,SunnyDude61049,4,Flew to Vietnam for pleasure on a newish A350.  Seats for economy were good. Nice and wide... food service was very good and ranks in top 2 for economy service. Real shrimp served as part of meal. Entertainment system had plenty of movies... Would fly them again for sure.
293,Swissa340,3,"The staff is generally not interested.  In Hanoi we did the online check-in but no drop off counter was open, so we had to stand in line with all other passengers. Chinese passengers were cutting the line left and right, i told the young lady that was supposed to supervised the queuing and she said “sorry no speak chinese” -&gt; not even trying to do her job. On the plane nothing special, cold service. We did 4 flights with VN, average 1h flight time, 1 in business and 3 in economy. In both classes nothing special. Other airlines in europe (e.g. SWISS) have a full drink selection , coffee, tea and a sandwich choice on the same flight time in economy class. VN offers water/coke/juice. Nothing else."
293,Kim Smith,5,We purchased tickets in Premium Economy and my wife went on the Vietnam Airlines website and looked into paying for an upgrade to Business Class. Did not have confirmation of the upgrade until we were checking in on the morning of the flight. Check in was most efficient and helpful and we were given complimentary passes to the Qantas International Lounge which was a very good way to spend an hour and a half. Priority boarding was excellent and the deluxe service began as soon as we found our seats. The Business Class section was only 40%  full. Seats were very comfortable and enabled us to put our feet up an fully lie back. Our 8 hour flight enabled us to get 2 or 3 hours sleep even through the daytime. Food was excellent and most plentiful served with great beverages. The accessory pack was also quite useful too. The staff had few to attend to and so we did not want for anything. The 8 hour flight went very quickly and we felt quite refreshed when we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City. Fortunately we didn't have to collect our baggage and all we had to do was make our way to the domestic terminal and pass through security with about 2000 other people and make our flight in 90 minutes. Staff were again very helpful on our Vietnam Airlines flight to Hanoi. We tried to come back home on Business Class but the Business section was very full. Premium Economy is quite cramped and quite hard to get any worhwhile sleep. We will definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again
293,Brian C,5,We flew from Frankfurt to Hanoi on economy class. The cabin crew were very service minded much more than we have experienced with other airlines when flying to Asia. It is not the last time we will fly with Vietnam Airlines.
293,Brenda R,5,Large dreanliner aircraft. Staff dressed in traditional Vietnamese uniform and very helpful.  The flight left on time.  Large selection of movies available with free headphones distributed and also a free bottle of water to every passenger.  Meal 1 hour after takeoff with choice of european or asian cuisine.  Another meal just before landing again with choise of Asian or european cuisine.  Free drinks with the meals either alcoholic or soft drink.  They also come around with free tea and coffee just after the meal.  An excellent airline.
293,Roald K,3,"The flight was delayed. That had no practical implications for us as we had plenty of time to a connecting flight in HCMC. <br>Staff did their job technically, but without visible efforts at being friendly.<br>I have been using this airline regularly for many years on domestic flights. There are few real competitors to choose among. <br>This flight only confirms previous experience."
294,Helen K,4,"We normally fly economy but decided to upgrade to premium economy as the upgrade price was so reasonable. When we arrived at Heathrow we were told that they had had to switch planes and there was no premium economy available as the substitute plane had a different layout. The customer service lady was very apologetic and we were offered a choice of 3 seats between the two of us or a row of 3 seats each at the front of economy. Obviously we were disappointed but chose a row of 3 seats each and actually this turned out to be the most comfortable way to fly.<br>On the way back we had our premium economy seats and I really wished they had switched planes on us again. Although the seats are a generous size they seem to be designed for people much taller than me, I am only 5'2"" and I couldn't reach the footrest which wasn't adjustable. The other problem was that the seats had fixed arms which housed the entertainment screen, so when the person in front had their seat fully reclined (as the people in front of us did for the entire 13 hour flight - including during take off!) I couldn't get out of my seat without climbing over the arm rest as there wasnt enough space. When we first arrived at our seats I had to ask the person in front to put their seat back up so that I could actually get in my seat.  If I'd been sitting next to someone I didn't know I'm not sure how they would have felt about me climbing on their seat to get out during the flight.<br>Having said all that the flights themselves and the service we received was first class, hence the rating."
294,eganji,1,"My husband and I used Vietnam airlines multiple times on a recent trip and I had a very concerning experience. My checked bag with TSA globally safe locks on it had the actual zippers cut off of it so that someone could break in and go through my things. Luckily, that big literally only had dirty clothes in it and nothing was stolen. But it obviously wasn’t security who did It as my locks were safe for them. This tells me an employee of the airline literally used something that could cut through metal with the sole intention of illegally going though my stuff.<br><br>I called the airline multiple times and no one could speak enough English to help me. I was simply told to send an email somewhere. This was weeks ago and still no one has helped me and now I have a basically new suitcase that is completely damaged.<br><br>Just wanted to warn of this. I get stuff happens but the fact that the airline doesn’t seem to care or try to rectify the situation is the real issue."
294,Thierry M,4,Our flight to Hanoi went smoothly and was punctual. The plane seemed a little old but was comfortable. We did not expect in flight food but had some (it was just a 2-3 hour flight). It wasn’t the best airplane food but we appreciated that it was included. Overall happy about our experience and for the value.
294,Lorraine G,4,We actually flew Heathrow to Hanoi and back again in the economy plus cabin. We were on one of the new Dreamliner planes which was incredibly quiet and very comfortable. The flight attendants were impressive. They were very calm and quiet and nothing was too much trouble. The legroom was great even when seats were reclined.  There was a choice of food offered which was either a western meal or an Asian meal and both were reasonable. A good way to start and end our holiday.
294,KP1,3,Disappointed by availability of food &amp; drinks on a long haul flight. Went over 7hrs with nothing offered. Worse on Rtn flight. Had to ask for water. Definity need to consider taking your own snacks &amp; drinks.<br>Attendants were aloof &amp; only engaged when necessary.
295,Quinox,5,"The plane was comfortable, the crew were friendly and welcoming, food was good, and a 13 hour flight seemed to literally fly by. The entertainment wasn't totally to my taste, but the music was OK and I slept most of the flight anyway."
295,Neil G,5,"I was originally booked with Malaysian Airline but my connecting flight from Bali was late, their service was great, flight comfortable, plane clean, no complaints."
295,andrewjameswarren,4,"This is quite an impressive airline.Whilst their business lounge at HoChi Minh City gets very crowded, boarding was efficiently run.<br> Staff on board were pleasant if slightly disorganised-  to be told when sitting in row 5 that there was no longer any choice for dinner was irritating, the more so to discover that the option sought WAS still available for those sitting in row 7, but on the other side of the airplane - and there were only four seats in each row..... <br><br>Business Class DOES mean proper lie down beds on long haul. Not too sure what good being on Business Class was for the early evening  hop between Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City (flight 658)! <br><br>But this airline now does seem to be the best value option for getting between London and Singapore AND getting a decent night's sleep."
295,Paolo Enrico Costa,4,"As for my personal experience, having moved along Vietnam with four different Vietnam Airlines domestic flights, I've got exactly what expected: perfectly on-time departures and arrivals, modern, clean and well looking aircrafts (all of them were A 321), basic service with no frills (only soft drinks for economy class - more than enough on 1 or 1.5 hour flights), kind on board personnel, good ground service in the airports with flexibility in managing luggage limitations, and last but not least extremely cheap tariffs..<br>Definitely, a simply very good service to recommend to every one travelling in Vietnam!"
295,GEKO,1,"When I did my online booking this time, I booked on Vietnam Airlines Webpage two flights from SGN to MNL and I was already  wondering why I could not reserve our seats. <br>About 24 hours before departure I wanted to do the online check-in. Not possible, it said on Vietnam Airlines Homepage.<br><br>Thus we went early to the airport in Saigon, and queued up for 30 minutes at Vietnam Airlines counter.<br>When it was our turn, the guy on the counter told us that there is no flight to Manila.<br>He checked the reservation on my handy, and really on the left, in very small letters, it said: ""flight operated by Philippine Airlines""! <br>So we could not check-in there, we had to go to the Philippine Airlines check-in counter. <br>I was really angry because of many bad experiences I had, with any Airlines from the Philippines before, I surely did not want to fly with Philippine Airlines.<br><br>And it became true this time as well. Philippine Airlines used one of the oldest Airbuses 321, and they were again 40 minutes late on arrival to Saigon. <br>No monitors or entertainment system, and the service and food was just below average.<br>I really felt I was cheated by Vietnam Airlines. <br>And from now on, I recommend to everyone to check carefully whether it is really a Vietnam Airlines flight.<br>If you're not able to do your online seat reservations or add additional luggage online, the flight is probably with another Airline."
296,Wine dude,1,Horrible horrible planes Vietnam air using for there domestic flights. We upgraded to business paid the fee. The seats are so old there is zero padding in the chairs and the plane is older than me. They don’t care just look at there ratings.
296,Oksana A,5,"Amazing service - exceeded expectations. We really did not expect this kind of good coordination on service of the whole cabin crew team. Food and drinks served on time and you don't need to call them as water, juices are being served continuously.<br>Boarding was very fast and in a very smooth way as well as flight itself.<br>We definitely going to fly back with the same airlines and make a decision on other trips with the same company."
296,Jorge E,5,"Very efficient staff in every stage : checking in and on board. On time, clean and modern Airbus, quick delivery of luggage on arrival.<br>Professional and reassuring at all levels"
296,Darren A,5,"Seemed like plenty of leg room on there planes, I also recon this is some of the best food I have had on an airline."
296,LoveToTravel0007,4,"After a long delay caused me (and a few others) to miss our connections, the airline put us in a hotel in Ho Chi Minh city and paid for our meals and airport transfers. They were kind and most of the staff we worked with were professional. <br><br>The plane was clean and the service was above average."
297,familyofive2016,5,We flew economy from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh. The hosts were very attentive with extras that we asked for it was never a problem. The flight? well its more about the going on inside that matters. We flew back premium economy and again hosts were great.
297,ConnyO,4,"The landing strip on Con Dao is really short, so the planes are limited to small 64 passenger planes. They are old, but OK.<br>Be prepared for a rocky landing, Con Dao is really windy."
297,Karenta,5,The flight from HCM city to Hanoi is on-time and the service was great!  Would definitely recommend to everybody.
297,Chloe,5,"We flew with Vietnam airlines not just international but domestic flights through Vietnam too. All left on time, the staff very respectful friendly and helpful, food surprised me better than expected, and if you pressed the switch for the attendents on the flight they were there to take your drinks orders. Would highly recommend flying with them! <br><br>The only thing I would of done differently is book directly with Vietnam airlines, we booked our flights via Expedia and we were looking to stay an extra 4 days in Vietnam but Expedia wanted over 1500 to change flights, if we went direct with Vietnam airlines it would of been 10x cheaper which is our only shame.. <br><br>But thank you Vietnam airlines!"
297,Dawn H,4,Ran to time.  The staff were efficient and attentive.  A choice of meals from the menu. Meals and drinks were very nice. Great choice of tv viewing.
298,Julianne S,5,"My husband and I both hate flying and were not looking forward to our flight to Vietnam for our wedding anniversary holiday. The flight seemed to go quite quickly for a change, maybe it was the great food (I know right!) or the lovely flight stewards, where nothing was too much trouble. We were given 2 meals plus they were very generous with filling up our wine, tea, coffee or water, maybe this is why the flight seemed so enjoyable! We even found our seats comfortable, we didn’t seem as squashed in as we normally feel, there just seemed to be a little bit more room than usual, will definitely fly with this airline again."
298,Cris,5,"We walked to a very clean clean aircraft for an 1:40 flight. The big surprise was the nice lunch they served. It was a complete tray with warm rolls, fresh salad and fruits, good ham and god tea. You don’t see it in any American or European airline. The service was perfect, courteous, fast,... wat a great surprise for such short and inexpensive flight."
298,John M,4,"This airline operates award points through its Lotus Miles program. Just don't try to use them as the Lotus Club has a contact number (Sydney) which never answers and calls are not returned. The 'new look' airlines has modern aircraft, average cabin service and a loyalty program that does not work."
298,rztravels,1,"Ladies/Gentleman, Please don't book with this airline if you are going to Vietnam.  I traveled on my business trip this month and order some special meal, which they don't have on the flight and by saying that we did not receive your request.  At the airport I request an Exit Row seat and they denied by saying that I don't speak Vietnamese so they can not assign me.  Mind you that I am a certified IATA Travel agent/former airline employee.  I know the IATA Rules and it does not say in any book that you have to speak a particular language except ENGLISH and must follow the flight crew directions in case of any emergency.  Thanks"
298,Professor_Kimchi,4,"Modern airplane which was very clean and good cabin crew service. Recommended but don't expect to get your meal choice. C'est la vie! <br><br>My one issue is with the meal provided.  They hand out very nicely designed menus prior to meal service which is not something I have experienced in economy before. This raised expectations about what to expect but was then let down.<br><br>On the outbound flight the meal was different to what was on the menu and on the return flight to Seoul my menu choice had run out.  That is OK in itself and not a big deal. A common occurrence in economy and you get what you pay for. The issue I had was that they had handed these fancy menus and then didn't deliver. What's the point? Just stop with the menus.<br><br>Anyway, the purser spoke to me very politely and apologized for the situation.  They were very polite and did their best to rectify the situation.<br><br>I do recommend Vietnam Airlines for flight to Vietnam.  Modern aircraft with good cabin crew service."
299,Ken A,4,We flew Premium Economy and found it very comfortable with plenty of room and very good value for money
299,daventurer,2,"Booked Business Class Melbourne-Ho Chi Minh- Phnom Penh and return. Firstly, the Airbus 350 has an uncomfortable tight fitting bed, even for a small person. Didn't sleep at all. The tight fit and a family with young children who stayed up all night playing games did not help. Had to wait in HCM airport for connecting flight to Phnom Penh, but was not permitted into the Lotus lounge because I could only show them my boarding pass, not a special 'invitation' card. Still don't know where I should have got that invitation card from. The airline when I checked in, or Flight Center in Australia where I had booked my flights?<br>On the return flight to Australia, things got worse. I had left Cambodia earlier because of illness and forfeited my ticketed flight from Phnom Penh to HCM. The flight from HCM to Melbourne was a week later. It never occurred to me that I had to inform Vietnam Airlines that I had left Cambodia earlier than planned. I did not see the 2 flights as 'connecting flights' as they were a week apart. Vietnam Airlines cancelled the HCM to Melbourne leg of my paid ticket without making any attempt to contact me first. In the end, I had to pay an additional $1100 to get a seat on another day, but they refused to itemise for me how they arrived at that amount. <br>There was also finger- pointing between Vietnam Airlines and Flight Center as to whose responsibility it was to contact me before cancelling my flight, and whose responsibility it was to issue me with a new ticket. The Airline personnel I spoke to on the phone and in person in their office in Dalat definitely did not go out of their way to show that they cared about the plight of paid passengers stranded in a foreign country. In the future, I would be booking my own flights to ensure that one leg of the journey is totally disconnected from other legs. I would not be booking return flights until a few weeks before the flight dates. One never knows when ones plans have to be changed. Using Flight Center did not make my journey easier. They turned out to be more costly, and provided more opportunity for passing the buck and for finger pointing. I have flown business class with Vietnam Airlines many times before, but probably never again."
299,David D,3,"Monday 14th and we were booked on Vietnam Airlines flight  VN1827 from Ho Chi Minh City  (Saigon) to Phu Quoc.<br><br>The flight was due to depart at 16.25 and arriving in Pho Quoc at 17.20 a scheduled flying time of 55 minutes.<br><br>There was a delay of about 15 minutes in pushing back from the terminal, one of the overhead lockers would not close properly and a member of the Ground Crew took some time to tape it closed.<br><br>When all passengers were boarded we were offered a refreshing tissue and once airborne we were informed that the flight time would be 35 minutes, which meant the flight arrived on time despite take off delay.<br><br>The seats were reasonably comfortable and the legroom was good.<br><br>There was a mad dash by the Cabin Crew to serve passengers with a drink of water or cola during the flight,  but they made it with seconds to spare before preparing for landing.<br><br>The aircraft was an Airbus A321 jet."
299,ed k,4,"This was a domestic route, and was my first experience with this airline. For a domestic flight, the aircraft offered spacious economy seat, and the pilots seemed well trained given smooth take-off and landing. <br><br>Also, the airline was very efficient. It was on time on both leg of the return trip, and the staff were very friendly. <br><br>Due to the short flight duration, there were no inflight entertainment or meal service, but spacious seat made up for it more than enough."
299,Ron T,3,"Flight delayed ~ 30 minutes.  Had to use a bus on the tarmac for boarding in HKG.  Flight time a little over 2 hours - they served a hot lunch (beef or chicken with rice).  Another bus for deplaning in SGN.  Waited ~ 15 minutes standing on the bus after deplaning for some unexplained reason before we drove to the terminal.  You would think Vietnam air would get a gate at their ""own"" airport (SGN)."
300,Wati Saterawati,4,"Other than the fact that the timings kept being rescheduled (days before the flight), it was a good flight. However, the customer service in the Singapore branch was really not helpful when we tried emailing and calling them to help us with a possible cancellation of the ticket. The flight otherwise was a smooth one, and on the day itself there were not much changes to the timing so it was all good!"
300,Lifestooshort,5,"Having a family of 6 extremely tall people (one son 6'8""), flying 24 hours in a squashed economy seat with no legroom and seats that aren't high enough to support our heads, we decided to pay the extra $$$ and fly premium economy with Vietnam Air as it was the cheapest premium economy fares. We have never done this before, and were hoping at best that we would all have a bigger seat and some legroom. We were blown away by how much extra room we had all had - bigger, more comfortable chairs, that recline further back, and a small cabin of 35 people. Absolutely loved it and id recommend to everyone. Movie options were pretty limited though, but this didnt bother us.<br><br>Also got priority check-in and boarding at both Sydney airport and London airport - but not in Vietnam - how ironic, seeing its their airline!!<br><br>Would definitely fly with them again, and would find it difficult to ever fly economy again after experiencing how lovely premium economy is!"
300,Robert E,5,Vietnam Airlines provided a very good service.  Attendants were extremely attentive to our needs. We chose seats in row 4 as this gave us more head space.  Meals were excellent and well presented.
300,David H,5,"From the moment we boarded we were taken care of very well. My wife is a wheelchair-user, and needs the onboard wheelchair as well since she is unable to walk. We had to transfer (via shuttle bus) between the international and domestic terminals at Hanoi airport.  A Vietnam Airlines employee accompanied us all the way. Both flights were very good and they both departed/arrived on schedule."
300,Heather A,4,"Travelled from Sydney to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh City and then Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney. Staff were very attentive, food was good with a nice choice and they didn't run out before they got to me, which for me was a bonus. The transfer from International to domestic in Ho Chi Minh was great they give you a sticker saying transfer as you come off the plane and point you to baggage collection, then they have plenty of signs and staff directing you to the luggage drop off still in the international terminal and then direct you to domestic. This was were the service dropped off, I eventually found my way to the Vietnam Airlines area and made it to screening which was miles long, lucky I had several hours between flights, the announcements were only made in  Vietnamese and I assume they were calling people to a short queue whose flights were close. Once in the domestic terminal it was better and flights were announced in English. I had a faulty TV screen on my seat so they moved me to the front of economy with a screen the worked. On the flight to Sydney, as not full we were able to move to empty seats so we were spaced out. Would fly with them again was a great experience."
301,Wilfred P,3,It was my second time to take flight of this airline. Service was average given that the flight time was only 1 hour 35 minutes.
301,Joan W,2,Worst business class I have been  on.  Small space.  Flat bed had gap at hip level making very uncomfortable overnight flight.  Very noisy - seemed to be people stomping past all night.
301,Ian Campbell,5,"From the minute we booked we had fantastic customer service with any questions we had and the one change we needed to make.<br><br>The staff on board we very attentive and their customer care was second to none. <br><br>We were welcomed on board with a hot towel and a vanity pack (toothbrush, toothpaste, eye mask and slippers) something we didn't expect in economy. We were also given headphones, a blanket and a cushion.<br><br>Our seats were comfy and the inflight entertainment was plentiful.<br><br>The food was tasty and we were given quite a few drinks during our flight,"
301,CurlymikeT,5,"Check in was smooth, with assistants directing us to suitable counters for a group check in. Airport was good, with coffee food and other goodies available. Flight and service was good, nothing to fault except plane was full but that shows how good they are. Baggage showed up without excessive delays and our man was there to meet us."
301,Elaine H,5,"Delayed 45 minutes due to technical fault. Good flight, plenty of leg room, cheerful cabin crew. Overhead locker big enough for luggage. Check in easy."
302,Patrick S,3,"Checked in online from an ipad for me and my guests. Arrived at the airport and was hoping to print my boarding pass via the self kiosks. Apparently, if you've checked in online you can't do that. So went to join the queue to finalise getting boarding passes. <br><br>I think overall SGN airport security is quite cumbersome compared to other nearby counterparts like KUL and BKK. SIN hands down is the most convenient of the lot. We had to remove all footwear for separate screening. <br><br>Anyway, it seems common to board the plane parked at remote bay. A bus took us there and boarding was both at the front and rear. Great for taking a quick selfie/picture without any airport glass hindrance. <br><br>VN has lots of A321s so it's a long plane. They serve wet tissues on board, followed by some light drinks (for a 40min flight). Both my flight sectors did not have the inflight magazines. I also looked on different rows hoping to find one but there was none. Obviously no IFE on board. <br><br>Landed in PQC and there ends the flight journey. Some tips for securing domestic flights. Do secure them months ahead and you can get really decent deals."
302,craigells77,5,"This was our first time in Premium Economy,  the seats were very spacious and comfortable, the little goodies pack is great also with socks, slippers, mask &amp; ear plugs. was a nice surprise. <br>The food on Vietnam Airlines is always very tasty and the cabin crew are very friendly to assist you to make your flight as comfortable as possible."
302,spyder2018,4,"A very Good Airline Company in class with SAS, good food, drinks and service at all.<br>It was my first trip with Vietnam Airlines and I was positive suprised.<br>Can recomend it"
302,Iain B,5,Check- in was efficient. All staff on  the ground and in the air were friendly. Cabin staff were attentive. Food was perfectly acceptable. Aircraft a appears to be new. One of our party required special assistance due to mobility issues. The airline had a record of this and arrangements had already been arranged at both ends of the journey (something  that some airlines seem to forget to do). I recommend Vietnam Air.
302,Elizabeth G,5,"Vietnam Airlines is a classy airline right from the livery of the aircraft to the uniform of the crew and the subtly-designed interior. The service was superb too and the food tasty and beautifully served. There was none of the callousness and indifference that one is beginning to expect from airline travel. Charming, confidence-inspiring and good service."
303,AGM304,2,"We are booked but not off to a good start. We were originally scheduled to go in September 2109 but our tour dates changed so we had to opt for an August date. Flying Premium Economy , The chargers were $573 per person to change what was already a full price ticket. Thats 8 months ahead of the travel . Ripped Off Vietnam Airlines."
303,HanoiOldQuaterTravel,5,"I and my family travel to Phu Quoc Island. We flight with Vietnamairline. The service is good, the staff is friendly and professional. Thank you very much.<br>We have great holiday. <br>I would recommend to everyone."
303,hola-snorkel-gal,3,"Our family of 4 with 2 young boys (ages 6,7) flew on Vietnam Airlines from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City, and then onwards from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong.  What was surprising compared to North American standards is that the domestic airport check-in was extremely different than the international check-in which obviously caters more to foreigners than to locals.  When flying domestic, be prepared that the airport conditions are representative of what the locals endure. There are long lineups, the facilities are dated, dusty and tired looking, there is no air conditioning at the check in  area, and the washroom conditions are quick lacking, no toilet paper or soap available.  When traveling though Asia, ensure you bring lots of hand sanitizer and lots of tissues in your bag!  <br><br>Furthermore, there is no opportunity to check into any connecting flights from your departure city, in our case Nha Trang (which is a pain as you are required to retrieve your luggage at the next destination, and check in all over again for your connecting flight.  Not the most efficient system. Ensure you leave yourself at least 2.5-3 hours to manage this process between flights especially if travelling with young kids!) .  Once we got through the local domestic check in and made our way to the boarding gates, the conditions were much better, for starters there was finally air conditioning!<br><br>The airport in Ho Chi Minh city is not the easiest to navigate. To get from the domestic terminal to the international terminal you are required to gather your own luggage from the arrivals area, get check through security, find your way outside to another building (pushing and shoving your way between the hundreds of people and cars that block all aspects of the roads the minute you exit the terminal) and up several floors (there are limited elevators and half of them don't work), so be prepared to take the stairs or escalators with all your luggage and children in tow! Not a stress free experience so prepare yourself accordingly!<br><br>The flight itself was uneventful and the quality of the flight was average.  Meals are served on even short domestic flights so that was a bonus. But the flight quality would be comparable to North American discount carriers.  The seats do not have TV monitors and the planes are a little dated.  The stewardess are pleasant and the flight did not feel unsafe.  If travelling in Vietnam, this airline probably ranks as the best in the country from a safety perspective."
303,Aase,4,"We enjoyed an on-time flight (others airlines flying the same distance that same day were cancelled) in comfortable economyclass seats and with very courteous and helpfull crew.<br>Check- in counters in Da Nang a bit busy, but all in all a positive experience flying with Vietnam Airlines."
303,Soeren L,4,"Travelled on domestic business class to/from Phu Quoc and found the onboard service friendly, but a bit too basic in terms of onboard offerings. Although just 35 min. in air, we had expexted a bit more then just a softdrink/beer. Other quality airlines at least serve a Quick snack in the same timeframe i.e. good old Airberlin, Lufthansa etc.<br>But that said, the Sky Priority check-in was smooth, fast track fine, Lotus domestic lounges in HCMC and Phu Quoc OK (but basic offerings) and dedicated business class buss to remote parked aircraft. So all in all an OK experience - if they had topped with a Quick snack onboard, Vietnam Airlines would had been great :-)"
304,glynn,4,"Flew premium economy, 12 hour flight on dreamliner, well worth the expense. Flight crew attentive but not intrusive. Seats were great, loads of room and they went back far with foot rest to help. Good choose of entertainment. Food was average."
304,Dr. JP Sarma,5,"Had seen a video of Vietnam Airlines in the Whattsapp earlier.. Was really delighted with everything. I had thought, probably the aircraft will be a small one and service OK, etc, etc. To my surprise, it was a  huge Jumbo. Our good experience started form the time of Checking in. Our flight was for 8.30 PM and was delayed by 30 mins.So the person in the check in counter asked, if we would like to travel by an earlier flight and so we were flown <br> 2 hrs before our scheduled time.The screening was professional and I had to open one of my checked in Bags as there was liquid inside a bottle. Anyways, the inside of the aircraft was clean and the toilets  too were clean. The inflight attendants were very professional and helpful and were adequately conversant in English too. The leg space was adequate and Food was good. Even I found the inflight entertainment to be good and  enjoyed watching a Vietnamese movie with English sub titles . There was turbulence in the flight, but the landing was smooth. Overall a pleasant flying experience."
304,mslovemoney,5,"We enjoyed our business class experience on Vietnam Airlines. The staff are courteous and attentive, all-be-it a short 55minute flight for this trip."
304,Donna M L,4,"Flewn kul-han-kix last week. Check in was fast and easy since no queue in klia. Food served is okay Like most asian food, it tastes local to me. Staffs are helpful. I just listened to the their onboard radio all the time. Kul-han flight was very comfy since the aircraft has not much passengers however han-kix flight was almost full. The boeing aircraft was a bit cramp for me coz I’m L size. Lucky I was sleeping the whole duration of flight And were only 2 passengers in the row so its not bothersome to go to toilet. Breakfast served is just so-so. I look forward in flying Vietnam airlines again."
304,Cheryl S,4,We were happy with Vietnam Airlines. They were punctual and loaded and unloaded planes quickly. We took 3 flights with them within Vietnam and they were all excellent. It was a bit of a nuisance having to use buses to the planes instead of air bridges but you got use to it. Planes were clean and service was very good. Staff were friendly and efficient.
305,Mark from Singapore,4,"Vietnam Airlines is a competently run outfit.  The ticket counter and gate staff are capable and helpful.  I've flown the airline multiple times and their arrival/departure record has been good, and I've experienced no checked luggage issues.  They are however very restrictive with regard to carry-on luggage.  In flight service is good and the meals are fine for airline food.  Overall, unlike some other airlines that come to mind, Vietnam Airlines appears to be a well run airline."
305,Bonnie S,4,"We got our ticket under a promotional price, around HKD1000 roundtrip HKG-SGN. Flight was on time and the service is good but VN should upgrade their aircraft. Pretty old A321 without personal in-flight entertainment system."
305,elainee821,5,It was a short pleasant flight. I'd fly with Vietnam Air again. Nothing too fancy - but they were on time and the seats weren't too bad.
305,Garry A,4,"i fly a lot and have used vietnam airlines many times , never had any horror stories , usually pretty close to being 'on time ' , good service ............"
305,Gilles B,3,"The plane was a brand new A350 which was nice. However, the rest was pretty poor: only one toilet working for the whole BC cabin (about 30 people), food wasn’t great and I was lucky enough to have very noisy people in the cabin with the cherry on the cake held by a lady who put her alarm on her phone for everyone to hear! She woke up everyone but herself. Unbelievable!"
306,507huwh,5,"Excellent flight to Saigon.  The seats were spacious and flat bed.  Video screens were large.  Food was goos, and above all the service by the cabin crew was excellent. On the ground service (lounges, etc.) were above North American Standards, though a bit below Asia standards."
306,profginsburg,2,"Most uncomfortable seats possible!  Thankfully I am only 5'9"" and 160 lbs - anyone taller or larger would be miserable!  And don't eat the food.  And with a world full of airports with jetways, at this ""modern"" airport the airplane parks on the tarmac and you climb stairs?  Yuck."
306,202Countries,5,"Almost scared to share this, because it was too good to be true. We flew a a family with 2 small children and opted for the new ESO (Empty Seat Option) a few airlines are now toying around with. In short: you google the ESO link of your airline, then you opt for 1 or 2 free seats next to you. Once the flight is locked (about 4-6hrs before DEP) the airlines knows how many seats (in ECO) will be free and allocates them to passengers that have opted for that option and so you might end up with 1 or 2 free seats near to you. You pay upfront, but you get your money reimbursed, if you dont succeed. In our case a 12hr long haul in a B787 the price was 36USD per free seat.<br>And we lucked out big time, we got 2free seats for each one of us. 4 entire rows with 3seats (28-31) fro teh family in an eco cabin with maybe 12-15 free seats in total, we got 8 of them. Many fellow passengers gave us bad stares, but they simply didnt know about the option.<br>On top of that, Vietnam Airlines inflight experience was good, food OK, drink service fair. Option for snacks between meals, drinks served all the time, FAs responsive on servcie button. IFE solid. So all in all, what else can you expect from an 12hr long hauls eco flight at a very good price in a modern aircraft? Not much more so 5 points well deserved, also weighing in a bit our experience on the other long haul we did with them. I do ~70 flights a year, lots of them long haul, from eco via prem to biz and in comparison to others, there few eco experiences that really top this airline to my pov. QR does regularly and so do the other 2 Koreans and maybe Thai and Singa, but VN does not have to hide, also both airports (SGN/HAN) are decent now"
306,John F,4,Would have had 5 stars if the business lounge in Hanoi slightly better.  Plane was a fairly new Dreamliner with a comfy bed and service was attentive as well as brisk.<br>The food was OK but not the best think BA standard not Emirates.<br>The huge bonus is a direct flight - would definitely recommend.
306,Inspiration593425,4,The staff were friendly and the flight was fairly smooth but I felt the service especially concerning drinks could have been better.
307,NearbyCactus,5,"It was only a 2 hour flight, but it felt like a proper international flight.  The cabin crew were very friendly, gave excellent service, and the food was very nice.  I'll definitely fly Vietnam Airlines again."
307,Wendy G,5,"Service and food was fantastic.  The seating and TV set up really comfortable with plenty of room to place magazines, bags and shoes.  Movie channels a bit limited but with the lay flat seats it was easy to grab some much needed sleep."
307,FrenchF1984,1,Horribly cramped flight.   Two in flight meals of poor quality in a 13 hour flight.  Water was in a bottle or a cup and you had to ask repeatedly for it.   There was an egg full of wine served with the main meal and half a cup of coffee or tea.   I will NEVER  EVER fly with this Airline again.   I arrived at our destination with a chronic back ache.   The plane took off with 3 toilets out of action.  The recline on the seats kept creeping back into an upright position.  The Air Crew were inattentive but polite.   The menu was a pointless exercise as the only additional food was a horrible pot noodle served in a pot noodle pot.   A DREADFUL way to treat passengers.   Perhaps VA think it is acceptable to treat passengers on a long haul flight in this manner because they are in economy class.     There was also a very  poor selection of inflight movies.   NEVER AGAIN.
307,HARRY C,5,I have used VN air twice in 12 months.  A friendly service .  On both occasions I booked Premium Economy for around only £220 return  - spacious and comfortable.    On one flight there was a minor seating problem for which I was paid  $200 refund
307,Oksana A,5,"We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi for the first time and were amazed with everything. in fact didn't expect much but turned out to be so far best in terms of service, food, attention from cabin crew and how smooth flight was.  we are frequent fliers with Emirates airlines and were very surprised to have such an immaculate service from Vietnam airlines . till last minute water was served even though captain announced the landing time and if it would be Emirates staff would be nicely sitting and telling you that sorry captain announced landing  and they  want do service. Here crew was very helpful and had a good eye for details  food was surprisingly delicious considering  ticket price as said previously didn't expect that much of service. definitely looking into other option of flying with Vietnam airlines. good job team🤗"
308,Tanya Millward,5,"Travelling down to HCM from Danang we had a fine experience with VA. Departed on time, arrived on time. Smooth travelling. Nice drinks and wet cloths on the flight. Would travel VA again without a doubt."
308,Toby,1,Avoid at all costs!!! Flown all around the world and never been treated so rudely by counter staff :-( A young man at Bangkok airport with a chip on his shoulder and not an ounce of sympathy. Very sad as Thai people are so kind and friendly. Please please please look elsewhere for flights.
308,Floris T,3,"Disappointed. <br>- Having moving like die hard(yes the first one), and mostly other movies from the 90s and vietnam was quite disappointing.<br>- service with a smile doesnt excist<br>- only 2 meals on a 13 hour flight"
308,Susan S,5,"We originally booked Premium Economy seats but then paid a supplement for an upgrade to Business class. This worked out cheaper than buying Business class in the first instance. It was well worth it the seats were spacious and comfortable and The Who,e experience put us in a good frame of mind fir our holiday."
308,Jane-ChrisBScotland,3,We did a return visit with our 19 year old daughter to da nang via ho chi min on the way out and via Hanoi on the way back. The flights were fine if a bit turbulent in the way back. They give you a blanket and slippers for the long haul flight. The food was pretty okay as airline food goes. On the way out they had sparkling wine but none on the way back. The white wine is chardonay which I personally can’t drink anymore.<br><br>My main gripe is the air hostesses. They never smiled and on occasions were unhelpful. My daughter was vomiting in the way back and no assistance was given until the very end of the flight. Only one even verged in pleasant and was the one who said they could have given our daughter something. An earlier male steward had been particularly unhelpful. <br><br>Inflight entertainment was okay too. The toilets were clean most of the time but that relies on passengers as well. Seat room was not bad and we all managed some sleep.<br><br>Hiwever If I had an alternative I would not use them again mainly down to the air hostesses. It felt as if we were as passengers a burden rather than trying to make a long haul flight as enjoyable as possible.
309,Sharrock1,4,"I booked my families flights online with eDreams and was nervous the whole thing was a sham. I was delighted to find that even though you can't check in online prior to your flight, that all I needed to do was show my passport and everything went very smoothly. Flights were on time, staff were friendly and accommodating, luggage arrived quickly at each end, even with crossing over to Angkor Air for the VN - Cambodia flight it all went perfectly."
309,Muhammad Fadhly J,4,Was a good flight . Airplane was clean and cabin crew were friendly and attentive. <br>Pleasantly suprised that the food served was considerably good .
309,GentlemanTraveler,5,The crew provided first class experience to economy class passengers.  I'm happy with the flight from SGN to DAD and back.  Nothing short of a professional airliner.  <br><br>Must fly on Vietnam Airlines for domestic legs
309,A Roaming Asian,4,"The experience will be nice, whether you're in Eco or Business. This airline is the best and is the most worth it in Vietnam. Sure you can save a buck or two in some other airlines but I do recommend pay a bit more here to save times and hassles.<br>HOWEVER, being the best in VN doesn't mean it's good. THE WORST THING IS THE GROUND TEAM. Holly sh the staff is so rule, at the company, at the airport. They're slow, they're rude, they don't seem to try to help me (I've been using this airline for years, so it's not a one time thing).<br>What you get in the air is nice though, I must say the flight teams are at least 5x better than the ground teams."
309,Martin G,4,"Overall I enjoyed the flight and the whole experience flying and boarding etc Efficient and friendly staff , crew and <br>other personnel was helpful. It was over festival season , 1000 's of travelers , but still enjoyable.    <br><br>The people are all friendly .. I guess so are the pocket snatchers"
310,DavidLU2,5,"Check in was swift and efficient. However fast track wasn't particularly fast but never the less it was without any hassle and airport security were very polite.<br>The lounge was well signposted and was on an upper floor with panoramic views over the runway and gates.<br>Food and drink was in plentiful supply and again staff were very attentive and friendly. Our flight was subject to a slight delay so a short while longer to enjoy the lounge, but when we eventually departed we were only s few minutes later than schedule and the lost time was more than made up for during the flight and we landed about ten minutes early in Bangkok.<br>The flight was smooth and there were only five of us up front so the service was unbelievable. we enjoyed a lovely meal with plenty of wine and champagne to chose from.  The aircraft was an A321 and seemed quite new and spotlessly clean.<br>Our priority baggage came off amongst the first three bags and we were on our way in no time."
310,Amin,1,"Flew with Vietnam from Ho Chi Minh to Yangon today. Waited sooo long at the luggage carousel. They lost my luggage, and ruined my day!"
310,notab3,4,"A viable alternative to the big names. Leg room was generous for a person of 1.6 m tall, cabin ""pack"" of pillow, blanket etc were as good as you would expect.<br>My only critisism would be that the menu did not exactly reflect the food delivered."
310,coznlinda,5,"Cheap, efficient, and on-time.  Flew them twice while in Vietnam.  Each time encountered help staff, on-time flights, and reasonable prices."
310,sussexrowmark,5,"An exemplary connecting trip to Bangkok three years ago with Vietnam Airlines made it the obvious choice for us when visiting Vietnam proper. And it was even better this time, in their Dreamliner aircraft with its high quality unobtrusive service, good food and lie-flat beds in Business Class. We left on time and arrived on time, with a special minibus at Ho Chi Minh to whisk us to the terminal ahead of the others.<br><br>Two possible areas for improvement. First, food and drink service. Sitting together with my partner in the middle of the plane meant we were served from different sides   and several minutes apart. Then at dinner on the way home my G&amp;T starter arrived only with the first course on the salad tray, while the bread rolls were not offered until I had finished the tray. At breakfast my cup of tea came on the same tray as the orange juice and (unwrapped) omelette. To stop them going cold, I ended drinking the tea and eating the omelette before the fruit juice, cereal and fruit salad.<br><br>The 2nd improvement would be to the airline's own lounge at Ho Chi Minh, where we had a lengthy layover. It does not cater for Western tastes. I was able to find some plastic cheese and small croissants but that was about all I could choose to eat. There was some wine but of a very basic quality - way inferior to that served on the plane."
311,Sarah Q,5,Excellent flight. Departed half an hour early and arrived half an hour early. Crew very friendly and comfortable seats.
311,haricej,4,"I travelled in Premium Economy with Vietnam Ailines.  Easy check in, very generous legroom on 787 Dreamliner.  Cabin crew were very polite and attentive.  Only downside was the timing and serving of in-flight meals which were not the best quality."
311,Suzanne B,4,Great flight to end the holiday.<br><br>At check-in we were offered exit row seats when the staff noticed my 6ft tall travel companion! no extra charge. <br><br>Gluten free also confirmed with the check-in desk.<br><br>We were surprised no to have the usual 'will you assist' briefing in the exit seats- no issue really.<br><br>Gluten free option was  a bit hit and miss- no separate meal so opted fo the safety of prawns with rice- all good in the end.
311,Connector171656,3,The flight was on time. <br>The staff could be friendlier: smile and greet happily. I was not informed of diff bus for business class to go to the plane.
311,Linda B,1,"Apparently they didn’t have enough people scheduled during the day so they just said, tough luck, and filled up a huge plane later that day. Too bad if you had other plans!<br>Very poor customer service! Not reliable! Told by some local Vietnamese travelers that this airline does that a lot!"
312,Cyrille M,5,"It was a great experience to try Vietnam Airlines for our Xmas holiday. The airlines has invested in new planes, ours was an Airbus 350-900 and the service is excellent even on this 3hrs flight from Shanghai to Hanoi.<br>Good seats with enough pitch for tall persons and excellent entertainment system with big screens. <br>Flight attendants made a good job with a smile. Plane was clean. Finally fares were very competitive."
312,MateEeMa,4,"Had a pleasant flight! The plane was relatively new, the staff is friendly, the flight was on time. Good seats and plenty of room. Food was ok."
312,BAS,5,Great airline.  Courteous aircrew.  The plane took off and landed nicely.  The flight  time schedule was kept.
312,David D,4,"Wednesday 9th January are we were booked on flight VN 8015 from Phu Quoc to Can Tho, we were due to depart at 13.35 and arrive at 14.30, a scheduled flying time of 55 minutes .<br><br>We were airborne at 13.45 slightly later than anticipated. Once we were in the air the Captain announced that that flying time would be 40 minutes.<br><br>We arrived at 14.25, which was a tad earlier than scheduled, despite our slightly delayed take off.<br><br>The seating on board was comfortable and good legroom. We were offered a drink of water or cola during the flight, not much time for anything else.<br><br>Overall a comfortable short flight with pleasant Cabin Crew.<br><br>The aircraft was an ATR 72 twin engine turboprop, with a seating configuration of 2 seats either side of the aisle along 16 rows."
312,Britt H,5,"When travelling abroad, you don't know what to expect from airlines you have never experienced before. I was quite anxious to wether I would get any sleep on our 12 hour flight to and from Hanoi, but if I had not slept, it wouldn't be the airlines' fault! Soft landings, pleasant accomodation, warm towels, better food than expected and movies to choose from for those who couldn't sleep ☺️ I will choose Vietnam Airlines anytime."
313,B0bT88,1,"Regrettably, we were assigned by Viking Cruise to fly this 3rd rate airline. Never will we fly this airline again.<br>Just like our flights, VA flights are often delayed, as many of our fellow passengers attest.<br>Prepay, prepay, prepay...<br>Upgrading. They used a 3rd party, OptionTown, to sell those potential slots, which we have to prepay, and charged to our account immediately, not at the time of our flight! Very strange way of upgrading. We were able to get the Business Class upgrade for our flight from HK to Ho Chi Minh City, but not for our next leg, and final destination, to Bangkok. The prepaid fees for the latter leg of our flight was refunded to our account 2 days later.<br>They sell prepaid baggage overweight as an options, which is an advisable option to buy. They charges very high overweight fees at the counter. To complicate matters further, their baggage weight restrictions are very limiting and strange! Lots of ""Got You""!<br>It is surprising that this airline, which bears the name of the country it represents, was not assigned its own gate in our stopover city, Ho Chi Minh City (nor in Hong Kong, nor Bangkok). Passengers are shuttled to/forth to the plane at all the airports in our journey. Climbing those stairs is a bear for seniors with carry-on luggage!"
313,Llej4,4,Long lines at check in counter so allow plenty of time at Sydney airport  although we travelled at a peak time and found that when arriving in Vietnam bags took over an hour to come off the plane<br>The trip was smooth  not much movies to select from and flying in December and returning in January the movies were the same <br>Airline food average
313,Benton R,5,"Great service at a great price.  If at all possible, if can book once you are in country the rate is much cheaper since you are flying domestically."
313,neil,4,"Very good for the price,good do with a little more staff training.Dinner and breakfast only on a 13hour flight."
313,SharonWilliam71,4,"I hadn't flown with Vietnam Airlines before this trip but I have to say I was very impressed with the value for money, service and food. And having upgraded to premium economy, I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious the seats were with a good recline and foot rest. Added to that we were given slippers, socks, ear plugs and eye masks to make the trip more comfortable. There was also good in-flight entertainment and sandwiches and snacks available throughout the flight. All-in-all it was a very good experience and I can highly recommend this airline."
314,NainaNK,1,"Took 4 flights with Vietnam Airlines with my partner between 31/12/18 - 07/01/19:<br><br>31/12/18<br>1) Singapore to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam<br>2) Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam to Nha Trang, Vietnam<br>05/01/19<br>3) Nha Trang, Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam<br>4) 07/01/19<br>Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam to Singapore <br><br>Terrible taking off skills<br>Noisy uncomfortable sounds from aircraft when taking off from Nha Trang <br>Timing so bad, none of the flights were punctual in taking off or landing <br>Waiting time so long at boarding area <br>Tasteless food<br>Will not take this airlines again"
314,ohteoh,3,"Flight took off on time which is appreciated but the stewardesses on board were another matter. Smiling obviously shortened their lives so they obviously saved it - seriously, nothing came with a hint of a smile and anything one asked for seemed like they were doing you a great favour.<br>My first flight on VN and it didn't leave a good impression.<br>Having said that I had an onward flight to Busan, South Korea on Vietnam Airlines that same night and it was a lot better."
314,KZ01012015,5,"First ever flight on Vietnam Airlines. Didn’t have a lot of expectations as it was a short flight but overall a great experience. The checkin and boarding was smooth, aircraft was clean and the friendly crew managed to served a nice meal even on this short flight.<br><br>Will definitely consider this airline for future travels if the opportunity comes up."
314,Dean Tucker,4,"The flight was great, food choices were tasty, in flight entertainment was really varied and the staff were more than happy to help when asked for anything"
314,CZH13,3,"Booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Seoul, via transit in Ho Chi Minh. Was surprised that both flights were on a narrowbody, with no entertainment system, considering it's supposed to be a full service flight. The food was great however. I'd still fly with Vietnam Airlines for the route since it has competitive pricing and good flight times."
315,Kustubh,2,"I was flying Vietnam Airlines on New Years Day Morning and what made matters worse was that the flight was to take off by 12.40 but we the passengers were waiting at the gate till that time without a clue or any update from the airlines. The designated gate had nobody from the Airlines available and the display board kept flashing ""FINAL CHECK IN"" for our flight even after the designated take off time had elapsed."
315,BoundlessEnergy,4,This airline was efficient and on time.  Snacks were served en route and Hostesses were keen to collect rubbish before landing.
315,blackaimes,3,"We flew economy class from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City on 21 December 2018. We were disappointed with the airline as we had paid a high price for the flight (taking into account the time of year), but felt the service and comfort was average. The seats on our plane were smaller than average. There was limited access to water and drinks during the flight and the food was poor compared to other airlines. We decided to upgrade to premium economy on for the flight home as we were so uncomfortable on the say over, it was not cheap to do so! Unfortunately it is was not worth the money. The seats are much larger and more comfortable than in economy class, however we still felt very crammed in next to other people and the food and service was the same as economy. I would not recommend wasting money on an upgrade. Only fly this airline if you are able to get a very good price, otherwise it will be disappointing."
315,nita musa,5,"I went on board the airline on 6th to 8th Dec 2018 and on both flights we were captained by Captain Okada who was very skillful during the plane takeoff&amp;landing which had no feeling of jolting or 'wobble' on the airtrack esp.during his landing👍👍<br><br>Meanwhile, the ground airline staffs were really helpful,swift&amp;efficient during our check-ins at the online kiosk centre.<br><br>I hope I will visit Vietnam again&amp;get to catch domestic flight on VietnamAirlines either on a holiday to Hanoi or Dalat in the coming future😊🤩"
315,kpiddy,5,"To our delight we were upgraded to exit row seats on our first flight with Vietnam Airlines, we were very satisfied and in fact surprised with the level of service and comfort of the flight.  There were two choices of meals for lunch, one western style, the other Vietnamese.  The choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were satisfactory also, Vietnamese beer and a range of French wines.  The staff appeared to enjoy their work and were happy to serve.  I would definitely consider flying with Vietnam Airlines."
316,Adil S,5,"I had the pleasure of flying Vietnam Air from Singapore to Hanoi with my family.<br><br>I must say that this was my first experience on this Airline and I was a little apprehensive about this experience.<br><br>I realized very soon that any concern I had was grossly misplaced. This Airline experience was one of the best I have had.<br><br>I was impressed with the efficiency and professionalism of the staff, from the check in counters to the flight crew. <br><br>The Check in process was quick, smooth and efficient. The best part was that the flight took off exactly on the scheduled time. No delays, and the reason had to be the efficiency with which the staff handled the boarding process.<br><br>The Aircraft seem new, clean and definitely very well maintained. The rest rooms were clean and smart. The service was very professional and efficient.<br><br>Overall, I would without doubt use this Airline again. I would also recommend this Airline to other travelers traveling on this Airlines route.<br><br>A pleasant experience, for which I thank the management and staff of this Airline."
316,Cpt to UK,4,"Our previous flight from Ho Chi Minh was delayed quite a bit, but this one was on time. You get one free drink and we had to pay for over weight luggage."
316,Yannick U,1,"Missed a flight in Yangon airport as this stupid airlines let you do OnLine Check-in for Flight Yangon to HCMC. But, even that you have Online Check-in + Boarding Pass you will not be able to pass the immigration...<br><br>You still have to go to Check-in counter @ Yangon airport which doesn't make sense, as it means that the OnLine Check-in is totally Useless...<br><br>Missed our flight and had to wait 2 extra days in order to catch next available flight ! This airlines didn't even wanted to reimbursed us + had to bear the costs of 2 extra nights in Yangon ! The Worst Company ever !"
316,Peter M,1,"My wife and I have flown VNA Business Class many times since 2012 ex Sydney either to London or Paris and as part of the Business Class fare we have been facilitated during the 16 hour layover with Visa entry to HCMC; hotel accommodation with meals for the duration of the layover and tranfers to and from the airport..<br>However, on this occasion this service was not provided (no reason offered) to us and we had to endure the 16 hour layover at Tan Son Nhat Airport. As neither of us slept during the twelve hour long haul flight from LHR due to cabin staff continually serving a male passenger seated close by to us beer and alcohol throughout the night time flight, we were in desperate of sleep which was not possible at this airport. Correspondence to the GM Aust &amp; NZ raising these issues and seeking financial compensation have been ignored - no response received. Such demonstrated the utter arrogance and contempt VNA has for its fare paying passengers. Other Business Class passengers on our flight warned us beforehand that they had been subjected to a similar experience on a previous flight.We will never fly with Vietnam Airlines again given this shocking experience even though we have been loyal customers for the past 6 years."
316,feiyun1109,5,"Flew with VNA several times and it was always fine. Flight attendants were nice and friendly. Entertainments is quite good. Food, for Asian like me, is fine. I like their snack. All my flights were on time, no delay. But the price is pretty high"
317,BeeJac,3,"The business class experience on Vietnam Airlines is very average. The check-in at Hanoi is slightly chaotic as it is completely unclear where business class passengers should check in. The lounge is inviting, however, it gets very busy during evening departures and snacks quickly run low. Staff were too busy to keep up with pouring alcoholic beverages (there is no self-service for alcoholic beverages).<br>The boarding process was completely chaotic, with no real specific queue for sky priority passengers.<br>The flight itself was below average. While the aircraft was brand new (A350-900) and one of the best aircrafts I have ever flown on for a long-haul flight as it is very quiet and comfortable, the Vietnam Airlines touches made the flight not too pleasant. The seat is ok, however, was not maintained very well. My screen kept unlocking and every single time the cabin crew had to hit it to try to lock it back in.<br>The most disappointing part of the flight was the service. The crew did not smile, only spoke when absolutely necessary (i.e. ""fish, meat of vegetables?""). Moreover, it was not possible to get a second glass of sparkling wine. To get a top-up of other beverages you always had to ask. The quality of the food was also average.<br>I would not recommend paying for business class on Vietnam Airlines."
317,bevmcqueen,1,I would never use Vietnam Airlines again.  We used them for our return trip from Australia to Vietnam and for our internal flights whilst we were in Vietnam.<br><br>The staff are not friendly and difficult to communicate with especially in Vietnam. <br><br>The flight attendants are rude and abrupt.
317,Skar78,3,"Four of us flew from HCMC to Hanoi, a 1 hour 40 minute flight.  Plane departed late and baggage arrived totally reeking of durian.  After opening our suitcases, everything (including all of our clothes!) smelled for days!!  It was very unpleasant."
317,Laksri,4,"We tried Vietnam Airlines on our whole trip to Vietnam, always on time and professional as well ! Very surprising and impressive!!"
317,George R,5,"Having now used this airline 5 times, I can assure you that their reliability, punctuality, comfort and hospitality is up there with the other highly rated airlines...... and pricing is very competitive."
318,Eszter B,5,"Easy check in, well equipped and modern plane. We departed on time, arrived on time, put on corridor at departure and arrival as well. Being a short flight, we did not have any food, but still it was very pleasant."
318,King of Grilled Fish - Hanoi Specialties,5,"Very good service and i like it. If any one want to go vietnam, i think you should go it by vietnam airline"
318,Judy C,4,When will airlines start to police the amount of hand luggage that people take on board.  On this flight 2 girls had more than 6 pieces of hand luggage and believe me they weren’t small pieces.  Grrr.
318,Alison P,5,"I was dreading the long flight (11 hrs out) and (13 hrs return), but the time went really quickly. Cabin crew were lovely, friendly and we were provided with additional items, (slippers, blankets, pillow, bottles of water, toothbrush and paste) which added to our comfort.  In flight entertainment was varied and plenty of choice. Food and drinks plentiful and choices were available. The longest flight I have ever flown so far, the last being 9 hours with a different airline, which was not nearly as good as Vietnam Airlines.  Will certainly fly with them again and recommend them to friends and family."
318,Tops333,4,"I took Vietnam airlines 4 times in the last 2 weeks from Hong Kong, and Inter Vietnam flights. The service was very good, all flights were on time, they went out of there way to make sure everything was good. The planes were clean and new. Would highly recommend using them"
319,gvincke,5,"Nice and smooth trip ith this company which goes better years after years. Very good service, enough room for the leggs (even for a westerner) <br>you can have a 7kg cabin luggage and 20kg suitcase<br>Departure on time and arrival on schedule. They operate as i could see modern aircraft. <br>A nice thing is that they offer a lot of destinations in vietnam at a very fair price for a national company."
319,Keren K,4,"We were very happy with the friendly service. On both ways the attendants at the counter helped us a lot and were even going the extra mile to help me and my extra tall husband with exit seats. Entertainment on board isn't wow  it's decent, 1-2 relatively new movies (Mama Mia and Ocean's 8). Food was also OK, there is always a choice between fish dish and chicken dish and I think you could notify them in advance if you are vegetarian. One thing that would be much better is the thecnical IT connectivity to other systems. On the way from AMS to Hanoi the attendants at the counters seemed to be confused about the luggage tags that didnt work with their system. On the way back to AMS via Paris CDG we couldn't get our paris-AMS ticket because their system didnt work with KLM which was the operator. Might be a KLM thing but was a bit worrying... overall very good company to fly with we were happy!"
319,Skully29,1,"Flghts delayed and the Airline could not care less..<br><br>Quick enough to take money. As an excuse they use is operational reasons, they are a joke and have ruined what was a good holiday! <br><br>The snow ball effect now is we will miss our connecting flights!"
319,Andy M,5,"Airline has a modern fleet of aircraft, has a great attitude towards service and was overall extremely efficient.  I have flown with Vietnam Airlines multiple times and have always been pleased."
319,Jhon H,1,"I booked a flight from hanoi- hochimin- Jakarta. At hanoi we got delayed 1,5 hours-almost 2 hours(after we get in the plane ! ), After that the crew give us seats in front ( but can't passed the business line), the reason is so that we could run faster after we landed soon. I complained that's not how you treat your customers when you've done wrong, but the air stewardess got angry back. After we landed, there's a ground crew that escorted as to the international terminal ( by running, we're a family with older person), but after we've reached emigration, she disappeared, without saying anything, without telling the gate, which is the last and we found it ourselves."
320,Mobashshera,5,"It was an excellent journey by Vietnam Airways. The food was alright , service was great and best of all , it was an excellent value for money. Would definitely try again and highly recommend."
320,Sophia,5,Food was not bad and the flight was smooth and comfortable. <br>The take off and landing was excellent. Would take vietnam airlines again.
320,ferriscaprice,1,"I recently had a flight with Vietnam airlines where both of my luggages failed to arrive at my destination. When referred to the Customer Services I received no help whatsoever! After calling and e-mailing for days there was still no reply. Although it was Christmas and I could not give my Family their gifts and had to buy new clothes, Vietnam Airlines refuses to compensate me..."
320,nonsense193,5,Good flight. The flight was smooth and comfortable. The stewardess were attentive to all your needs. A nice meal served. Changed planes in Ho Chi Min and was a easy process.
320,hoftho,1,"As i am tall, i asked for exit seats, that was not possible, so we got the last row seat witch is narrow and so close at the Toilett, that no leaning backwards is possible.... i had never such an uncomfortable seat!"
321,dylarr,5,"I've flown Vietnam Airlines a number of times previously. My most recent flight was from HUI - MEL via SGN. Every time I've flown Vietnam Airlines I've found the staff and crew very pleasant and professional.<br><br>The only downside of the flight from HUI - MEL via SGN was that even though our flights were ""connecting"", they could not check my bags through to Melbourne from Hue so we had to re-collect our bags and check in again when in Ho Chi Minh.<br><br>Aside from this, we flew on the brand new A350 on the SGN - MEL segment and the aircraft was comfortable in Economy. The seat pitch was generous and the seats themselves were comfortable. The in flight entertainment was as expected. Meals on the flights were tasty.<br><br>All our flights were on-time. Would definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again based on my past experiences."
321,Juapce1,1,"We were recommended Vietnam Airlines by other travellers . We are frequent travellers all over the world , this has to be the worst airline we have ever used . So far we have done two long haul and two short haul . The staff are rude and unhelpful on both the plane and ground staff .<br>The food on the plane was inedible , so hence so food was eaten on an 11 hour flight . <br>Drinks were offered water , coke, orange were the only choice .<br>I feel for the cost of flying with this airline is  not worth the money , use an alternative if possible."
321,george s,1,"Thinking about making a trip to vietnam? My advise is try to avoid vietnam airlines at all cost unless is an emergency. Price of economy class ticket but traveling on a small budget plane. Attitude of either the counter crew or air crew is just as bad. They wouldn’t attend to you even if you have any questions. To top things of the flight that I was traveling in doesn’t have air-conditions on. I believe the air-con system was down. Old and small seats, I would rather travel on Scoot or Jetstar if it was a budget trip."
321,Blueman99,4,"We traveled with family in business class between Sydney and HCMC, and also domestic between HCMC and Da Nang. Great service in flight, with a good level of room and comfort. We were all able to get a decent sleep with the flat chairs. Food was reasonably. Would travel again on VA to Asia."
321,Madhavi d,3,"Well, the ground crew/staff were very friendly. Checked in my bag and my sister's speedily. However, the flight attendants on the plane needed to work more efficiently. We purchased some watches and necklaces as they sold duty free stuff on the plane. However, we were told they did not accept credit cards. My sister ended up giving them cash. When we landed, they were still counting the money (the change they needed to return to my sister).... Very inefficient and the products were all made in China, very disappointed."
322,Nguyen Van Phong,4,"This has been the best Airline in Vietnam and, of course, their prices are a little bit more expensive than others, but you can find cheaper tickets when you buy early or in their promotion campaign. They always have good food, flight attendants wake you up in the middle of the flight, serve you a meal, then offer tea or coffee."
322,N1369CIlouises,5,While I have indicated economy it actually was premium economy.  The leg room was great I have long legs and could hardly touch the seat in front.<br>The option to darken your window without a shade was quite unique.<br>Seating configuration is two four two great when there is only two in your party.<br>Service is fantastic and the crew are very professional.<br>Would travel with this airline in the future
322,angfrost,5,"Great airline! Brand new planes, great food and in-flight entertainment not bad at all. Comfortable with plenty of leg room."
322,Carlos G,3,"good in flight service but planes were not cleaned to well between flights, entertainment lacking, quite a few levels below other airlines."
322,Turnedoutniceagain,5,"Very comfortable flight on a Boeing 787.  The seats in Premium Economy are head and shoulders above other airlines we have flown.  The food was very good, the crew were attentive and friendly.  We took off exactly on time and landed exactly on time.  The internal flights we took in economy were punctual and comfortable too.  Would recommend."
323,dreouw,5,"worthy price vs service that we get,<br>you'll receive refreshment, hot meals and inflight entertainment.<br>if You have garuda miles , you can get it by asking the check in person to add your miles number.<br><br>cheers."
323,Ianfung,4,Flight was perhaps one quarter full and stewardess allow us to move to other seats ( so naturally took emerging exit for max leg room ). The beef strew was excellent: tender and tasty but huge for breakfast. Really can't complain! Well done.
323,Brown C,4,Good value and a lot of legroom for economy.  Too bad it was delayed by two hours.  We will consider flying them again.  Wish they had beer for their beverage service but there will be plenty when we arrive
323,Philip F,3,We were heading to Vietnam for a week's stay &amp; pick Vietnam airline for our first destination in Hanoi. It was a non-stop flight &amp; price was quite reasonable. Check in counter were friendly and prompt. For boarding we have to use a bus to get to our plane which was not the best arrangement since there were stairways involved &amp; we have to carry our carry-on with us. They do serve food on short flights &amp; the quality was like any other low budget flights enough but not fine food
323,clanmacpherson,4,"We made two flights on VA, Hanoi to Da Bang and Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh city. Check-in was simple and efficient; the boarding procedures well managed; flights departed on time; aircraft were clean and modern; staff were polite but firm. What more could you want? We'd fly with them again anytime. Pity US airlines could not emulate these airlines!"
324,Melbtraveller2014,3,"I recently have flown with Vietnam Airlines 3 times, 2 out of the 3 flights they got my meal choice not recorded, even though I watched the travel agent do it 48 hours prior for the flights. I couldn’t also select my seat online, it said 24 hours prior available, then 10 hours prior but the website didn’t allow it."
324,Steve R,3,Vietnam airlines is no better or worse than others as all long haul economy travel is horrible.<br>As a way of improvement...<br>The vegetarian food is probably the worst I have had. The other food looked great so improve the special meals please.<br>The cabin crew were great and as good as Singapore Airlines.<br>Overall not bad but a nice meal would have helped.
324,Chris on tour,4,Good flight and good service. Meal was ok as were the drinks. Check in was hassle free. All in all a good service.
324,GreatOceanAir,2,"First time on Vietnam Airlines. Lovely newish Airbus 350-900, great aircraft. We departed Melbourne in the morning for an 8 hour trip. Will be arriving into Ho Chi Minh late afternoon. BUT: 2 hours into the flight as we are tracking past Wilpena Pound (I had left side window seat) and Lake Eyre in the distance the cabin crew demand that I close my window shade. They wanted - and got - the whole cabin dark and quiet and then all disappeared. Presumably to avoid having to do any work after the meal service.  The captain then helped them put by putting on the seat belt sign for hours - despite no turbulence. <br>I do not want to sleep in the middle of the day for a daytime flight ! I refused to comply initially and the cabin crew member got slightly angry. Claiming it was needed for ""movies"" My wife and 2 kids chimed in helpfully saying it did not disturb their movie watching..She persisted and I half lowered my shade. What a tragic waste not to see the Flinders Ranges, Lake Torrens and Lake Eyre...This was just 100% lazy zero service from the staff, no regard for their customers. <br>The ""turbulence"" was non existent - I am a pilot myself with plenty of flying over outback SA, NSW, QLD, NT. The seatbelt sign was on for hours unnecessarily. Subsequently had a chat with a pilot colleague who flies wide body passenger jets to Asia (with another airline) he confirmed my suspicion, seat belt sign and window shades used to get passengers to sleep during the day so the staff can sit back with less to do. <br>Finally - check in was very poor too - just not enough staff rostered on for a very large aircraft. 1 hour in the queue.<br>Not good enough Vietnam Airlines - never again for me."
324,Michos65,4,Recently flew to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam Airlines. On the way we flew Premium Economy as it was a day time flight. This was OK but no foot rest at all which I think should be part of any Premium seat. On the return flight we upgraded to Business as it was an overnight flight &amp; wanted to sleep. The seats were flatbed but have a gap so not easy to lay comfortably. The food was very average &amp; not at business class standard. Cabin crew were noisy so sleep almost impossible. Overall I would not pay the business class fare again - stick with Premium economy with this airline.
325,Maps43645217339,4,"Flight was clean and generous leg room for Economy class.  Entertainment was minimal so we kept ourselves occupied with  movies downloaded earlier from Netflix. Meals were generally good and were served a full meal for the short trip between HCM to Singapore. What was best was the hot rolls they served as many airlines serve cold rolls  nowadays. Overall, great value for money!"
325,Roxrover,5,"My flights with Vietnam Airlines were good; efficient, on time and good service, but commenting on the flights is not the purpose of this review.<br>On my way home a mistake in my itinerary meant I missed a connecting flight from Saigon, thereby invalidating the entire ticket home. This was nothing to do with Vietnam Airlines, I wasn't flying with them but their desk staff at Saigon Airport went out of their way to help, spending 30 minutes or more online on a very busy day for them to rebook me on another airline. I am very grateful."
325,peter j,5,Suggest you fly Premium Economy to Hanoi as we did or Business Class if you want to pay the extra.<br>It was 11 hours to Hanoi and 13 hours back to London.<br>The seats were excellent with plenty of room and the food was as good as any other airline. The service was excellent.
325,confucius73,4,We were heading to Nha Trang via HCMC. Flight left Singapore seamlessly as expected. Being based at the Terminal 4 gives it a posh experience but the newest terminal is a step back in time. <br>The inflight service is efficient. You get what you's expect for a short haul flight in economy. Crew was friendly. Aircraft was clean and got us there.
325,Lou502014,5,"Flew Melbourne to Saigon the onto Da Nang in the same day. Flight was delayed in Melbourne half an hour. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. All food, alcohol, entertainment and comforts (blanket &amp; pillow) included in the airfare. Great leg room in the economy seats and toilets stayed clean throughout the flight. Layover in Saigon was 2 hrs. VA staff greeted us on arrival, placed 'in transit' stickers on passengers with connecting VA flights and clearly instructed us what we needed to do. The layover was a smooth transition to our onward flight to Da Nang with plenty of time to spare. Would highly recommend flying with VA. Flights are a little more expensive but you definitely get what you pay for and more. Have done the same route with Jetstar which was a total disaster = never again!"
326,Maria3851,4,Its always good to fly with Vietnam Airlines.  We have flown  with  Vietnam Airlines many  times  before .    It  never fails  to give a good service.  They  even  offer us to become a member  on  their  Lotus Miles when  we flew with them  to  Luang  Prabang  in  Laos. It was rather nice. This afforded us to changed  flight  date  without too much  penalty on our returned  to Sydney. The service in their main office in Hanoi is very efficient.
326,lous652,4,"We have now taken 3 trips on Vietnam Airlines, each lasting around an hour.  The planes are relatively new Airbus 321 and fairly comfy in coach.  The planes have hit the schedule each time—they board early and are ready to go on time.  In flight, they barely can serve water and coke to about 200 passengers, but they get it done.  Good airline for flights within Vietnam and surrounding countries."
326,yorkp1,4,"Plane left a bit late but made up most of the time in flight. Newer version of Airbus A350-900 has comfortable seating in economy. Service was good, although rushed on the return trip - why? Entertainment was the usual movie and TV stuff on screen above meal tray.<br>Food was very ordinary, especially on return. Suggest eating the Asian menu, as the non-asian menu was not good but in fairness, much the same standard as other airline food. Return flight was late, as it left late and was in holding patterns twice near Sydney, as airport was very busy. My brother flies Vietnam Airlines all through asia, as he lives there. He recommends them too."
326,bandbtee,5,Vietnam Airlines is a surprise from a price you would classify it as budget but it is far from that with great service and quality food it was certainly a surprise when first used andhaving flown 6 times now I cannot speak to highly
326,Anissa Z,4,"I was dreading get on an unknown airline to me.  Until recently, I was an Emirates believer, all the way.  Vietnam airlines not the most new but they staff was really nice and on a 2 hour flights, we got snacks and drinks (non alcoholic) and people got blankets,  without cost, if they asked for them.<br>Coming back from Phu Quoc,  there is no online checkin so I checked in at the airport and that was painless as well.  The ticketing agent gave me a window seat so I was happy.  Next thing I know, I'm also the only one with a row to myself!  It was only a 2 hour flight but I was still excited.  My seat was broken and leaned back even without me pressing a button to lean back.  I apologized to the people in back of me for that <br>On the way there, I was given a snack box and a drink and on the way back, I got a hot meal!  Not expecting that at all.  I chose beef with noodles.  The fruit was melon watermelon, and papaya.  <br>I would definitely use Vietnam airlines again"
327,Jen,1,"I am used to lose my luggage with airlines company, but Vietnam airlines has the worst client service ever ! Never see that ! <br>My luggage was lost and they didn’t know where it was, not a problem but they did not even care about it! <br>They didn’t want to call Shanghai airport to make sure my luggage will be in the next plane, they told me they were WAITING or if I wanted I could contact them !!!!!!!!! That was their job !!! <br>I told them I will come to the airport to know where my luggage is, they insure me they will reimburse the taxi fees but arrived at the airport they changed their mind and did not reimburse me !!!!!!!!!! <br><br>Never have to deal with a service like that !!! <br><br>I certainly not recommend this company except if you want to lose your luggage and not have answer !"
327,Noor Azman M,5,The services rendered by the crews and staffs were great. No delay on flight and arrive on time. Easy to check in.
327,jessicalm81,4,"This airlines was very comfortable. Their planes are very modern and included many amenities. They also offered good cultural in-flight movies. The only con is their reward miles do not last long, only a few months, unless maybe you upgrade or are a frequent flyer."
327,clement c,4,"Flying from Singapore to Da Nang ( transit at HCM) on  end of March and found that, this Airlines Provide good Service. The seat was spaces and we have pleasant flight"
327,Gordon Eckinshoft,5,"this is good!!!!!!!! i went to vietnam because by grandfather was born there, we visited the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh in vietnam."
328,Selvaganapathy S,1,Bad experience with this airline crew <br>Had to ask several times for water and no show even pressing for air crew calling button <br>No one responded till landing! <br>Crew likes to give excuses as not to serve you till I had to throw tantrums.
328,yota r,4,"Since we had a bad experience from Vietjet air we changed our flight to travel with Vietnam Airlines and they were much better.There was no delays, the food was great, there was no change in the departure time."
328,Denis Mark,5,"The services rendered by the crews and staffs were great even though we were seated at the last row..<br><br>Thought we were be forgotten but no, the crews and staffs were very patient with us and fulfilled our requests.<br><br>The on board meal provided were nice and tasty as well..<br><br>We book the VN662 &amp; VN661 Economy flight so the only entertainment we got was the in flight radio station."
328,SimonandMaz,5,a great trip all the way no stops saves time and hassle the few dollars extra spent on the flight was well  money wellspent
328,johnstuff,5,Our first on the Boeing Dreamliner B787 was excellent. We were impressed with the Premium Economy seats giving extra legroom and seat width. The cabin service and meals were well up to standard and our flight was on time. The only adverse comment was that the window shading was controlled by the cabin crew even though a button was provided under the window. The inflight entertainment films were poor and the moving map was not very helpful.
329,sevenhearths,4,The seats were reasonably comfortable and the staff was courteous and professional.  Takeoff and landings were great.
329,savednfree,5,"good customer service. <br>staff were very professional, friendly and helpful<br>the plane itself was very neat and clean. decent meals and drinks."
329,Kalle A,5,"Business class on Vietnam Airlines is a really comfortable experience, starting with priority checkin and a fast lane in front of the security checks, to be continued in the excellent Hanoi Premier Lounge and a really comfy seat inside of the plane. Service during flight was excellent, so I can recommend this airline for all flights in Vietnam"
329,babeface0,5,What a great airline. More spacey than most economic trips. <br>Very friendly staff. Food was extremely good for airplane food.<br>Great entertainment on board. The cabin crew was always there for anything u wanted. You didn’t even have to ask most of the time.
329,Hemangkumar S,5,"If budget is not matter then you must opt for it. Sofesticated people, punctuality,cleanliness, staff everthing is on place we can say. However you can book it well in advance to get the benifit of price. It allow you to carry 20kg check in and 7 kg cabin per pax. Also with lowest class i.e. Lite i think you are not alllwed to do web check in or seat selection so you can reach to airport early to get prefered seat."
330,Stewart T,5,Great flight attendants . Great food . Nice champagne and wine ....very comfortable . No hesitation in flying with them again
330,brightfeathers,4,Very glad I chose Premium Economy on this long flight.  Comfortable and reasonably spacious. Good service.  Clean toilets.  Not great food.
330,aforeigner.abroad,5,"We flew from Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) to Hue and found the flight to be very nice! The cabin was nicely cooled, to the point where the staff offered blankets to a few who were cold. The plane was new with good, comfortable seats that reclined very far.<br><br>There was in flight entertainment as shared screens from the ceiling played a Vietnamese show but sound was limited to headphones so the cabin stayed quiet.<br><br>I am 6'2"" (187cm) and had no problem fitting on this flight which was a nice surprise while flying in Asia where many flights are packed to the max. We definitely recommend Vietnam Air!"
330,Roger H,5,"First time we have flown with VA, was very impressed. The standard of service was superb, with flight crew going that extra mile.<br>We had 3 more flights whilst on this trip with VA all were equally good.<br>Really impressed, will fly Vietnam Nam Airlines again."
330,yoavc68,5,"nice, clean, comfortable, on time, kind service.<br>We flew several domestic flights with this company, and on each flight the feelings were the same"
331,Sosad12345,4,Great flight with excellent service. A well priced flight for this class of travel using latest 787-9 and A350 aeroplanes which are very quiet comfortable with flat beds.
331,chrismA7305YV,5,"The direct flight to Saigon on a 787 is the way to go! Very quiet and comfortable, good food and in-flight entertainment. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly with them again! Also flew with Vietnam Airlines internally and have no complaints!"
331,Sandy S,5,"Very good flight, we had to fuokuaka. <br>On time and also very friendly crew staff<br>Will use it again ,fares very reasonable"
331,Ian,4,"Flew to Ho Chi Min city (and return) on a Dreamliner and found the service onboard quite good and friendly with enjoyable meals.  Had 5 internal flights and pleased with the service.  The negative was the poor service at check-ins with checking in taking up to 30 mins even though 2nd or 3rd in the queue, staff very inefficient."
331,Tran Anh,2,"I have experienced an awful trip with Vietnam Airline. Firstly, while checkin, the staff worked so slow that their were only 4 guests in biz class but had to wait a long time. Other staffs did not allocate us to other lane or help us anything. <br><br>While boarding, there is no private lane for biz class @@<br><br>On the plane, seats were old and dirty - old fabric from seat can make you feel uncomfortable if you are wearing short/skirt. I got itchy for more than 2 hours.<br><br>There was lack of entertainment - no personal TV, no duty free shopping, only news paper.<br><br>The food was ok. <br><br>The only perk was express lane for immigration. Not worth the price."
332,Joyful Land Tours,4,Flight operating in right time but I like to suggest that will perfect if they announce also in Myanmar language and should be entertain with short film movie or anything instead of advertising only.
332,Dalit-LR,5,"Comfortable seats, good collection of movies, kept the kids busy throughout the flight.<br>Good variety of food and drinks.The flight attendants serve water and juice constantly throughout the flight. The kids received instant noodles between meals.<br>Food is even served in the domestic flight between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi."
332,Trang,4,"They got plenty of complaints, however i've never got any bad service. Price is so so, water is served for all flights and food is for flights over 3hours."
332,pqhoang84,3,"Over crouded, delayed, normal service quality. I was expecting more for that price. The slightly better that other low-cost airlines only."
332,Clarence C,3,"It was a 2 leg flight...First leg from Singapore to Hanoi was good, the legroom on the Airbus was comfortable, food was good, pity no entertainment on board.  The connecting flight from Hanoi to Kansai was on a relatively new Dreamliner, The seats are surprisingly smaller than the older Airbus, and the leg room was just adequate...<br><br>Overall the flights were not that bad, only problem is the crew do not speak English and announcements that are not pre-recorded are impossible to understand."
333,Thanh L,4,"There are no significant difference in terms of price between Vietnam airline and other budget airlines for domestic travel, especially when you can get better service and better vibe with this national one."
333,Iris H,3,"Recommended for short flight only because there is no inflight entertainment or WiFi. Inflight meals are so-so, you can only choose between beef &amp; fish, no chicken. <br>Overall flight experience was not too bad."
333,LKUG,3,Older plane with no TV screens so no entertainment but the flight was so short it didn’t matter. Boarded the plane about 40 mins before departure so no delays. We took couple of other flights in Vietnam with this airline and it was the same.
333,P8949DWmichellec,3,"Its a small plane with 6 seats, 3 on each side.  The plane is a little oldish with no in-flight entertainment.  Being the national aircraft carrier, I would expect the plane to be better maintained.  However, the service staff is polite, patient and 😁.  The food is also surprisingly good!  It feels like a budget flight with food provided ..."
333,leisa.ferry@gmail.com,5,They even put me up in ho chi min city on way back due to long layover along with own personal guide for a day trip to see the city!
334,Terry P,4,"Good service and nice meals, transfer check in was a easy at Frankfurt. Enough legroom from the seat in front and loads of entertainment channels to keep you occupied for the whole flight. Could not fault this flight with Vietnam Airlines."
334,Footprints629950,5,I have flown with Vietnam Airlines often. The flight to and from Melbourne is non-stop and makes the trip much less tiring. Flights are always close to the expected arrival times.
334,Flo413,5,It was the first time I had flown with this airline but I cannot fault it. The cabin crew were attentive throughout the whole flight. I thoroughly recommend it and would definitely use them again.
334,BoardingPass702098,3,#NAME?
334,Big Al,5,"Easy check in, friendly and very helpful staff and the planes are A325 that are great for a 45 minute flight. I'm 6ft 5in and was comfortable sitting in the seat. The transfer from the airport to the plane was on a bus that was air-conditioned and only a 5 minute drive with minimal waiting time and passangers were boarded through the front and rear section relevant to seat numbers which made the boarding process seamless."
335,patrick m,5,"I must say, my family was concerned about us travelling with Vietnam Airlines.  After all we are ""Qantas people"" and at a pinch Virgin.  ""Are they safe?"" was the family's question.  Not only does it have an excellent safety record but the flight experience was great.  A new, very comfortable plane.  Great service from a very helpful and friendly crew.  I would definitely use them again.  No question."
335,Antonia A,5,"The plane was not new nor sophisticated,  no personal TV, only the personal music. But it gave me time and chance to finish my book reading. The pilot was very skillful, the take off and landing process was very smooth. The crews were very nice and polite, and not judgemental. The food was delicious  and the serving process was excellent and cheerful.<br>I will certainly fly with Vietnam airlines again when I need to go to Vietnam."
335,Janet H,4,Flight took off on time and landed slightly ealry which is often the case when flying east. Welcoming staff.. No problems.
335,Russell C,4,The Dreamliner aircraft was comfortable and quite. The service was good. Food was OK but not great. I would fly with them again.
335,travelingrules,5,"Such a first class airline, they treat you like royalty even in economy. Our flight was short but they brought out a full meal and drinks for everyone on board. They are stingy with the wine, but whatever. It was a short flight. Their terminal was lovely too. We actually took a boat from Saigon, Vietnam to Phnom Penh, Cambodia but ended up flying Vietnam Airlines from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap. Such gracious service. I would fly again and again and probably will upon my next return to Vietnam, want to explore Hue and Hanoi next time. Cannot wait to return to this bountiful, beautiful and friendly country."
336,Z8663ENdavidf,4,The level of service was surprisingly good and for economy was a comfortable journey. On the return leg they moved my teenage son so we had more room. Flights inside Vietnam were also very good and ontime. Food wasn't always great but not the worst I have had either.
336,789maria,4,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this airline.  Efficient service,  very clean and planes seemed new.  Took 3 flights with this airline, and cannot fault it."
336,smith1877,4,We flew to and from Hanoi with Vietnam Airlines plus three internal flights. The standard of seating and service was very good. Food was good. Very efficient airline.
336,HeathernMark,4,"Always good to fly with Vietnam Airlines.  Great service, friendly staff and good food.  Beats a lot of other airlines with their quality.  Nothing is too hard for them."
336,Bev15,5,"Could not fault this airline.  The plane was a relatively new Dreamliner.  The stewards were helpful, polite and efficient.  Food and entertainment as good as any other airline.  Would definitely use them again."
337,Russell M,4,Excellent service but need stay in Saigon as 14 hours transfer time. Definitely use again and would recommend to friends and family.
337,john fleming,4,Very impressed with V.N. airlines. Clean comfortable and to be honest right up there with Singapore airlines for the shorter trips
337,Kim H,4,"Flew with Vietnam Airlines at least once a year, sometimes twice a year. This August, we noticed that they have definitely picked up their service standards, which was something to be recommended for. In the past, crew service were very ordinary, we would  only fly with them because it's the only direct service to Vietnam."
337,frennies,5,"Excellent service, fully flatbed seats arranged in a 1.2.1 herringbone style.<br>Had to change flight to warp than I had booked it cost just over £1 ! Absolute bargain!<br>Highly recommend!"
337,Stuart C,4,"Brand new plane made for an enjoyable flight. Excellent food and service. Was a little concerned prior, but recommend as a value for money airline"
338,Shelley D,5,We love Vietnam airlines. We had a connecting flight from Hanoi to London. The flight was cancelled so we were put up in a 5 star hotel. All food and services provided for. So a problem became a delightful interruption. Well done Vietnam airlines. Will always b travelling with them.
338,1975Trudy,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect as I hadn't heard of this airline and read some reviews saying it was basic but we were over the moon with the quality of service for the price. There was just as much space as on a larger airline economy seat and the staff were very kind. The meal choices were larger than usual and the drinks on offer were a great range. No delays, no complications."
338,shane m,5,It was one of the quickest check ins you will have on any airline. They are very accommodating if you have any requests. I travel with them as a tour manger with a large group of people and they all ways look after my group. I use Vietnam airlines on International and domestic flights and never had bad service.
338,"Tony, Debbie &amp; Gemma",3,"We flew two internal flights and one international with Vietnam Airlines. The internal ones were very basic with no in flight entertainment but they were only short flights and pricing was good. The International was Hanoi to Singapore, on time, good flight. As good as any other."
338,Carol O,5,Excellent service. Checkin fast and efficient (qantas staff processed checkin)<br>Cabin crew were extremely friendly helpful and efficient<br>The plane was comfortable and quiet - as I slept for most of the trip.<br><br>At Ho chi Minh city the airline put us up in a hotel for 8 hours as we had a stop of 9 hours. They also organised our transfer through customs.<br>The plane was a 787 dreamliner <br><br>I will fly with them again.
339,North Star,4,"The ground staff at Phu Quoc airport were extremely unhelpful and inconsiderate even at the special vietnam airlines service desk. However, The vietnamese airline staff on the plane were very helpful and understanding of the fact that the unexpected 40 minute delay would affect passengers  with short international transit flights. Since our flight to Melbourne was also with vietnamese airlines they helped arrange a staff member in Ho Chi Minh City to guide us to the international check in counter and allow us to use the ""special assistance"" counter so we wouldn't miss our flight back to Melbourne. Very thankful, if we were on our own with no guidance we would have probably missed the flight."
339,Holiday Lover,4,"Nice airline, very friendly and helpful staff. Food was above average. Sufficient legroom and descent seats and inflight amenities. Entertainment is average when compared to the likes of Etihad &amp; Emirates but still a good selection of movies. Overall very happy and will definitely fly again."
339,K D,5,"The flight was memorable as it was a nice service, great flight with nice food and great introduction of Vietnam. Will highly recommend and will take again from Singapore to Ho chi minh city. Service standard is better than Singapore airlines which is lousy."
339,5Cali,4,"I have used Vietnam Airlines for a while ago and did not have a good impressive.<br>This time I found they improved a lot even the flight attendants still lack of friendly smile face.<br>I did bought a ticket online, but later I found it was a error. I called the company and they make a correction for me smoothly.<br>The suitcase allowance is 30Kgs, I suggest Vietnam Airline should make a clear statement in their website . It is very complicate and easy to misunderstanding.<br><br>Another thing is the flight attendants should make a warning to stop the customers using their electronic device watching movies or games with the speakers on."
339,Heguang Z,3,Looks like Vietnam Airline likes to book multiple flights only a hour apart and then at last minute to cancel some to consolidate them into a few flights. Our flight got canceled on the day of flight and we were put on another flight a hour later. No big problem for us because we did have connecting flight. Only to stay at airport lounge longer. The one hour flight was uneventful. Still better than the train in my opinion.
340,Heguang Z,3,Flew to Da Nang from HCMC. One hour flight and not expensive. Better than the train which will take over 10 hours. But the flight was canceled and we were rebooked to another flight 1 hour earlier (thank god we were at the airport much earlier). So check the flight status and get to the airport early.
340,Penny5555,3,The personnel in the air were good.  The ground personnel could use a little encouragement to smile but they were efficient. The ground experience was ok but I can't imagine what it would be like if you were there in the rainy season as we did not have jetways to our plane.
340,KodoDrummer,4,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines from Ho Chin Minh City to Da Nang. I had an economy seat, 43D, on the 1-hour, 20-minute flight. The aircraft was an Airbus A321.  The legroom and seat comfort were excellent.  There were about three inches of extra legroom between my knees and the seat in front of me. There weren’t any individual monitors with economy seats. Drinks were provided on the flight. The flight price was about US$55, which is the least expensive flight I’ve taken in the past ten years."
340,Duane U,5,"My first time flying Vietnam Airlines, only flew Economy but it was one of the better economy flights I’ve taken. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. The lunch they served was tasty. I won’t hesitate to fly them again."
340,Ken M,4,"We actually opted for premium economy because the additional cost was quite reasonable and it was well worth it for the space (width) and leg room.  The aircraft was very clean, especially the toilets, which were immaculate throughout the 13-hour flight.<br><br>The food was reasonably good (it is hard to enthuse about ANY airline food!) and the cabin staff were both friendly and efficient.  I would not hesitate to fly Vietnam Airlines again."
341,142JanetH,5,"This was the second internal/domestic flight on Vietnam Airlines and again I have no complaints - everything was smooth from check-in to flying and departing. Again, the plane was clean, the economy seats were comfortable, and the staff were kind and attentive. I again would not hesitate to recommend anyone using Vietnam Airlines domestically at all.  AND as I said before, I would definitely try Vietnam Airlines for an international flight."
341,142JanetH,5,"We did an internal/domestic flight from Ho Chi Minh city to Da Nang in central Vietnam. Everything from check-in to flying and departing were smooth. The plane was clean, the economy seats were as comfortable as a Qantas domestic economy seat, and the staff were kind and attentive. I do not hesitate to recommend anyone using Vietnam Airlines domestically at all.  After this I would definitely try Vietnam Airlines for an international flight."
341,Jennifer C,4,"Was pleasantly surprised at how good the service was. The food was mostly OK. Even in economy, we received a gift bag with socks, eye mask, toothbrush and toothpaste. The plane was very clean and the staff friendly. We asked for sparkling wine and were served French champagne. This is unheard of in Economy. Check in and out was no problem. They had great earphones too, not the measly little ones, but big comfortable, adjustable ones. There was also a good range of fairly late release movies. Overall a pleasant experience and will be recommending Vietnam Airlines to my friends"
341,jnodar,4,"Vietnam Airlines use a modern fleet of Boeing 777 Dreamliners that reflect their new mission to conquer Asia with their planes. While modern, the aircraft did have some hiccups. My middle seat entertainment unit did not work for all of my inbound flight from SYD to SGN, and I reported it to the flight crew if it got fix, great if not, well, too bad for the next guy in the middle seat.<br><br>I must admit that the food in the economy section was pretty good going and coming back to SYD.<br><br>The only thing I noticed was the flight crew did not smile a lot. I realise that working on a plane cannot be easy but not one (male or female) smile at all.<br><br>Overall the flight was short (8 hours and a bit) one way, so I had no significant issues to complain about. <br><br>Check in as expected, took a little bit under an hour going and a bit less coming back but we were flying economy, so you get what you pay for.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend Vietnam Airlines but try upgrading to Business Class – it has got to be even a lot better unless someone rode Business class and can say otherwise."
341,W&amp;L,4,"We were on two flights with Vietnam Airlines during our trip and found the airline to be very nice.  The planes were clean, the economy seats fairly comfortable and they served pretty good meals even on flights of 2 hours or less."
342,Prjes,4,"Our group of 8 golfers were booked premium economy. Upon check-in at the airport we were advised that our aircraft had been changed and that premium economy was no longer available. Business class was full. The airline staff handled the down-grade most professionally, both at the airport, and on our return at their Sydney office. They gave us a substantial cash refund at the airport, marked our baggage and boarding pass ""priority"", and on presentation of our boarding pass at their Sydney office on our return processed a n additional refund. A difficult  situation well handled."
342,Malin Benemark,5,"One great experience, from take off to landing!<br>Huge plane, but quiet and comfortable. Nice and friendly staff. Good food and good media range"
342,golanoh,5,"Good servies, tasty food<br>Nice entertainment<br>I always like to use this airline <br>It is my prefered in the far east"
342,AshleyHenkel,5,"Vietnam Airlines offers great service, comfortable environment, good choice of meals and drinks, friendly attentive cabin crew. Efficient check in."
342,Robyn M,5,"Checking in at Tulsa was a little less easy than usual-things simply were not working properly, but staff did the best they could and were very pleasant. Hopefully, by our next flight the new system for going through customs and immigration will have all the bugs ironed out(that was the worst bit of the day- just a shemmozzle).<br>The crew was attentive and the food good and not until we were about half an hour from landing (captain told us that) did we realise that this flight would be a bit different. We circled a couple of times but did not go any lower. The captain then announced that we had to wait upstairs until he could find a safe route to land. We did not feel at all unsafe and just wondered why it was almost pitch dark at around 1600!, it took about another 45 minutes and then we landed, straight in and not one bounce. Thank you captain.<br>On the ground, we learned that HCMC was at the tail end of a typhoon. We will continue to fly VN and hope that the captain will be on our next flight."
343,Richardkhoo,2,"This is our first trip to Vietnam and on Vietnam Airlines. The Economy seats had good leg room compared to many airlines. Flight out of Singapore to Hanoi was delayed by an hour due technical. <br>On our return journey from Danang to Singapore via Ho Chi Minh there was no through check in, though we did internet check in for both the DAD-SGN and SGN-SIN sectors. On arrival SGN, we had to lug our bags from Domestic Terminal 1 to International Terminal 2 - quite a distance away. Very stressful and inconvenient. Luggage was very late in coming out too. Again our departure was re-scheduled an hour later. In fact on Vietnam Airlines our original booked flights from DAD to Singapore was changed and rescheduled a few times!! Not a very reliable airline as far as on time schedule is concerned. Service is quite mediocre. <br><br>Richard"
343,Sarahp2342014,3,"Our outbound flight from LHR to Hanoi we really enjoyed, staff were friendly, food was great, left on time etc. <br><br>Our return from Saigon was pretty bad. We paid for an upgrade with Option Town and were told upon check in that there was no available seats. That is fine, when we booked there was no guarantee. After a 6 hour delay with awful food as compensation when we were boarding the flight they told us we had a upgrade and handed us new tickets. As we looked at them we realised we were not seated together and refused the upgrade. Why they could not consult us before automatically upgrading us is poor service. Subsequently we have struggled to get a refund from option town who partner with Vietnam airlines. <br><br>We were also not entitled to any compensation for our 6 our delay - considering our original flight was at 1am we had a terrible sleep at the airport with the time being pushed back every hour."
343,wil90620,3,"For the first time we paid extra for premium seats, the seats itself were ok but seeing I am about 155cm tall my feet could not reach the floor, not even the footrest on the floor. The <br>The passengers in front of us had their seats right back and we were unable to get in or out of our seats.  The meals were ok.<br>Above our heads where’s  the light is and the van  this area was loose and wires were showing, continuesly vibrating."
343,Trippinwithus,5,"We had a lovely 15 days trip in Vietnam in November 2018 during which we used Vietnam Airlines for 3 domestic flights. Our last flight was from Phu Quoc to Saigon after which we had a very tight international connection (due to cancellation/rebooking of our flight to Saigon which we found out the same morning). We explained the situation to VA staff in Phu Quoc airport and both in Phu Quoc and in Saigon airport we received extraordinary assistance. We have never seen such a quick and effective service. It literally saved us from missing 2 consecutive flights! Well done Vietnam Airlines and once again, thank you!"
343,Kelly M,5,"11.5 hour flight made to feel comfortable, Nice staff, nice food, continuous drinks , would use again"
345,Discover and Devour,5,"We were really impressed with the service of Vietnam Airlines for our direct flight from London Heathrow to Vietnam (Hanoi) which took around 12 hours each way. <br><br>The checkin via the website was a little complicated, but the staff at the airport were very friendly and more than happy to help. They had very generous baggage allowance in comparison to budget UK airlines.<br><br>The staff on board the flight were very friendly and helpful throughout the flights. The food was not bad, but then no airplane food is perfect!<br><br>Overall, in comparison to flying with other airlines, we were very happy with the service we received from Vietnam Airlines and we would highly recommend them."
345,tamaraoconnor,4,"Flew out LHR - HCM in biz class, finally living the dream of turning left and flatbed on plane.  Lived up to everything I hoped it would be.  No segregation of boarding so it's a bit confused queue up at the gate as there was no sign for biz class passengers<br><br>Return leg from Hanoi to LHR in premium economy: again we boarded at same time as economy passengers so it was a scrabble for space in the bus out to the plane.  Cabin was comfortable, but food was not standard I would expect in premium economy that would be my only criticism."
345,750kittiyas,3,"I cannot do any of online check in, I tried both web and application. The staff cannot speak english fluently. I sat next to old japanses gentle man, he asked for tea and support many time but staff cannot speak japanese so they cannot understand. Staff rush him to order food and drink, i thinks staff must know at least 3 basic day to day speaking of contry you departure, contry you go and English."
345,Aung K,4,"Good seating and food as a standard airlines services. They provides lounges, transportation, hotels, food and beverage in the Hanoi Noibai airport."
345,caitymini,3,"Staff are very friendly and speak English and Vietnamese. The food was not the best, the smell of the food made me and my partner sick. The movie selection was small, however they did have a few new releases like Isle of dogs and Meg. Seats are small and cramped, for a 11h flight I’d recommend paying a little extra for more leg room."
346,Denise S,5,"Travelled from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi with them. This was our first flight with them, but check in was very quick and effective as we asked for special assistance.We had booked our flights on line as we were not fluent in Vietnamese at all!!! There was a meal on the flight and the staff were very good and did speak English. The planes were very clean and the flight was very punctual!!! We would highly recommend this airline. We travelled with them again from Hanoi to Da Nang, and then Da Nang to Nha Trang. All our other trips were of the same high standard."
346,DINH THI NGOC DIEP,4,"Service, foods and staffs are good.<br>It is very comfortable flight. Even we have to transit in Saigon Tan son nhat airport"
346,Straw Tran,5,"Good service! There was light meal in the flight. Also there were screens with free movies, games, songs for passengers to relax. Flight attendances are very nice and gentle. Online checking is so convenient. Remember to bring your earphone."
346,Jim J,4,Travelled with them international from Sydney to Hanoi in November then from Hanoi to Sydney on 2nd December.   Also had two internal flights with them plus a flight from Hanoi to Da Nang and a flight to Siem Reap and return.   At all times we found the staff to be attentive and courteous.  The planes were clean and instructions were given in English.   Food varieties were sufficient to enable a choice.   Check in procedures were efficient.   Would certainly recommend them.
346,coolsmurf,4,"Due to Typhoon Usagi, my 8PM flight was delayed due to bad weather. There wasn't any announcements about the delay until sometime before boarding at the boarding gate. We were then redirected to Daisy Restaurant at the airport to get our dinner. Waited and waited, and given a new flight time of 0115. this was then changed to 0215 a while later. The flight took off around 3 in thunderstorm conditions, but nothing uneventful once we cleared the skies of HCM. Served another full meal on the flight. It was a decent flight overall i would say."
347,steve p,4,"Plenty of leg room, really comfortable seats, lots of choices for entertainment, food good, staff friendly and efficient, one of the better long haul flights we have been on."
347,Cheryl S,4,"My husband I flew two flights in Economy with Vietnam Airlines after several Business Class flights with Singapore Airlines so we were not looking forward to these, even though they were short 1 hour flights. However we were pleasantly surprised as both our flights left on time and the crew was very helpful and efficient. We have flown on much worse Airlines so would definitely travel with them again. Their planes appeared to be new and modern and very clean. I cannot comment on the food on the flight as we were only offered a drink due to the short time in the air."
347,Grumpyman27,5,"Never flown with Vietnam Airlines before but what a great find. Service was excellent, lie flat beds comfortable and all very good value when compared to the European carriers."
347,David L,5,"What a wonderful experience travelling Business Class and it was so cheap, au$100 p/hd. The air and cabin crew were wonderful, no wonder the airline won top accolades in 2017/18."
347,ed w,4,It was only a short internal flight within Vietnam. The seats were comfortable with adequate legroom
348,Gretchen A,5,"Greeted by well dressed friendly flight staff. Seats comfortable, plenty of leg room. Beverages offered. Would fly with them again."
348,Carole M,3,"Very importantly both legs of the flights were on time, however the food was not up to business class standard,  and the in flight entertainment was somewhat limited, not a problem on the return leg as it was  mostly overnight.<br>Check in was quick and efficient, however the Lotus Lounge was very average<br> Cabin crew were relatively efficient but lacked personal touch.<br>If you are looking for an inexpensive business class, flat bed, ticket this is probably the best you will get, but don’t expect the same service as some of the Middle East airlines."
348,Alan C,5,Very relaxing on long haul. Attentive service from the crew. New plane 787. Internal flights in Vietnam and Cambodia upgraded for free.
348,Steve P,5,"For a very short flight of about an hour, we found attendants to be solicitous, friendly, and helpful, the snack provided to be more than adequate, the flight was on time, and boarding and deplaning efficient.  Seats were reasonably comfortable with adequate legroom, and we'd certainly fly with this airline again."
348,Dalesue,4,Up graded to premium economy equivalent at time of booking as it was very good value to do so.<br>Service and comfort was good and stewards very polite and helpful.<br>Virgin airways should take some notes from them.<br>Only downside was that they did rush everything to get us into night flight mode<br>Which was a shame.
349,ChloeLau,3,"Firstly, it was quite comfortable, with a small pillow and a big blanket provided. It was a short flight before we were supposed to connect to our next flight. The in flight entertainment was limited,hardly anything to watch while flying. Upon arrival, the weather was bad in Japan that we couldn`t fly. They would fly again the next morning, seven hours away. The airport accommodation- some sort of small cubicles- was limited and costly. Then, we were asked to wait at one of the restaurants with big sofas. Again, blankets and pillows were provided and some of us had to rest our head on the dining tables while sleeping.  A complimentary meal was provided, to choose from a very limited menu, but at least it was tasty. It was a rare delay that we encountered and I hope the airline has offered better options for us to spend the hours. The next flight, food was good. But again,... in flight entertainment was limited. Perhaps they can do something about that, especially when it was quite a long flight and it was during the day, when many passengers may not be sleeping."
349,Hippothehorrid,3,"I'm glad it was a fairly short flight. A long way to go to meet business class standards, particularly in the food. A tired interior. No entertainment. A code share flight with China Airlines."
349,DougBellatti,5,"Beautiful planes with a wonderful business class set up.  The flight attendants were all extremely gracious and professional, offering excellent service to make the flight a pleasant one!   Food was surprisingly very good!"
349,Michael L,4,I flew with Vietnam Airlines on three domestic flights within Vietnam and everything went smoothly. There was no delays nor cancellation. Staff were friendly.
349,Kaz,5,We had a lovely flight with Vietnam airlines. As I am 6 feet I struggle with some airlines leg room but there was ample for me in economy. Food was nice. Plenty of choice of in flight entertainment and great luggage allowance of 30kgs
350,greg,4,"Everything from check-in to the actual flight went very well. The ground staff and flight staff were friendly and co-operative. The meals got you ready for Vietnamese style food, as well  western food was part of the menu. In- flight entertainment was plentiful and enjoyable. I would travel with this airline in the future, no hesitations."
350,pierre m,4,"the problem is at checking counter as all flight are at the same counter so long anarchic wait to get a boarding pass as the machine was not working , the seat was terribly incomfortable , nobody speak english!!!"
350,Scenic29473296852,5,"The only airline that flys direct to vietnam.<br>Great service, nice food on flight 10""lcd tv with a good selection of movies and tv shows.<br>Slippers and toothbrush provided by cabin crew to every passenger..<br>Arrived on time a good bonus.."
350,Freedom737185,1,"Recently purchased tickets for this flight that were advertised as automatic transfer. We planned to fly from Nha Trang to Hanoi and then Hanoi to Siem Reap, the time between the two flights was 2hours and like I have said this was sold as an automatic transfer. <br><br>We checked our bags in Nha Trang and noticed the bag tag said Hanoi. I asked the gentleman at the desk if my bag would make it to Siem Reap as that was my destination. He replied with a ""yes"" and continued with the next bag. He printed out boarding passes which again only stated Hanoi. I asked again why this was as the flight I had paid for was to Siem Reap. At this point he said that we have have to self transfer from the domestic to the international terminal ourselves.<br><br>We spoke to the information desk who said it would be fine as the average time to check into a flight a pass security in Hanoi airport is apparently 2hours. This wasn't good enough as all we had was 2 hours which left no room for error. The gentleman ensured us that he would contact the Vietnam Airlines team in Hanoi to assist us.<br><br>At Hanoi no one assisted us. We made it to check in with under an hour to spare only to find out we had been bumped to a later flight. <br><br>The flights themselves we great, and the air crew were very nice.<br><br>I just feel we were miss-sold, unsupported and unduly stressed"
350,Sarah S,1,"we had a very positive experience on our flight but had a nightmare with the ground staff at Nha Trang airport and Vietnam airline miselling their flight. <br><br>We bought a flight from Nha Trang to Siem Reap from Vietnam airlines which was listed as a connecting flight, not a self transfer. Therefore we booked a flight with under 2 hours connection time. <br><br>Checked in bags at Nha Trang airport. Tags put on said our bags were going to Hanoi - our connection spot. I asked the member of staff whether our bags would go directly to Siem Reap and he said yes. We were not sure he knew what he was doing and asked again, which was good job we did. another member of staff jumped in and informed us that no they wouldn’t and we would need to transfer our baggage ourself despite it being a connecting flight. She informed us that they can’t do connecting flights and we would have to self connect. Ie collect bags, change terminal in Hanoi via bus, go through security and check in again. All with less than 2 hours. <br>Obviously we were not happy about this as we had booked accommodation in Siem Reap and may potentially miss our flight as we needed to self connect. We wouldn’t have chosen that flight if we had known this in advance. Also if we hadnt pressed the staff in Nha Trang we wouldn’t have known any of this! <br><br>On the plus, the plane was comfortable, the cabin crew were excellent, and they provided free food and drink despite it being a short journey time"
351,Eddy D,5,"I was concerned what flight to choose from Danang to HCM, either Vietjet or Vietnam Airlines. Finally choose Vietnam Airlines based on tripadvisor comments and it was great, rather new plane, perfectly on time departure and arrival"
351,nasghar2001,5,"I was bit concerned when I booked flight on Vietnam Airlines. To my surprise it was the opposite. I flew between Hanoi and Siem Reap, Cambodia, to Ho Chi Minh city and back to Shanghai.  Aircrafts are brand new, service is very good and departure and arrival are on time.  Seats are quite comfortable. All flights were flown by pilots from U.K.  Takeoff and landing were exceptional. Airline tickets are reasonably priced. Very good airline to fly with."
351,Batupahat1947,4,Very satisfactory service. Plane ain't that old but in good condition. Foods and drinks provided very acceptable. Public address system could be better coordinated as it was confusing when background music and presentation were on simultaneously together with announcement from cabin crews. Apart from the minor grouse the airline can be highly recommended.
351,whaleshark32,5,"There are only 35 seats which all have extra legroom and recline.  Two members of staff so everyone was served quickly.  Towels, drinks and amenity packs were issued before take off and drinks and refreshments were offered throughout the flight in addition to the meals which were good.  Overall worth the extra for the better seats.<br>Negatives - seats are difficult to get out of if row in front is reclined.  IFE was poor with very little choice particularly for the return trip so bring your own entertainment.  Unable to obtain boarding cards from the APP.  We thought we had specific seats booked in advance but this turned out not to be the case.  Only able to check in 24 hours in advance."
351,Heng How N,3,"Reach airport about 8:45 am. The check-in counter is having long queue and about 30min later was led by the staff to business counter to check-in. Go through the immigration and screening smoothly.<br>About 10:15 am board the aircraft - Airbus 321. For another 30min or so, the aircraft take-off. Serve by 3 male &amp; 3 mantured female crew members with about 70% full. <br>The flight entertainment is limited as there no video screen on the back of seat and maybe can try the audio music. <br>The meal is okay - pork or fish with rice. <br>Overall the sevice is average."
352,Heng How N,3,Viet airlines is depart from T4. The check- in still through the normal counter. The flight take-off per schedule and is almost full. <br>There is no individual video screen on the back of the seat and thus limited flight entertainment. You can just try the audio or music. The meal is average and the selection is just fish noodles or pork rice.<br>Overall the service is average with that normal pricing for a full service airlines.
352,Matthew C,4,"We flew Hanoi - Da Nang as a family of 4. Efficient boarding, and check in. <br>Flight was good. Food was about what you expect on a plane.<br>It was only an hour flight so no seat back entertainment etc.<br>Would fly Vietnam Airlines again."
352,P&amp;L,4,I have done checking online so I was not need to stay in the long queue to get my boarding pass.<br><br>(Flight CN1344) Boarding was 5 mins late than scheduled but departure was on time.<br>Nice pleasant flight and friendly crew.<br>No USB slot to charge mobile phone. <br>Landing in Nha Trang on time but a bit tough.
352,Amanda2906,4,"We took 5 flights throughout Vietnam during our holiday. Overall great service, comfortable planes and friendly staff. Check in process was very smooth. Only 1 flight was 10 mins late so impressed! The only thing to note is that if they give you in-flight entertainment on the longer flights they don't give you headphones to hear it like other airlines! So make sure you have your own."
352,Elizabeth Q,4,"This was only my second flight with Vietnam Airlines internationally.  It was half an hour late leaving but arrived exactly on time in Hanoi. There are small differences with some other airlines. The cabin crew do not introduce themselves by name and they do not refer to the travellers by name. On my flight several people were upgraded so the Business Class was full which meant the cabin crew were very busy. However, there was always someone available if needed. The food was  good although the pate  I ordered  as an appetizer was so hard it was impossible to spread it on the bread. The red wine  - The Macon -  was excellent. It was sometimes difficult to understand the announcements made."
353,Natalie Z,4,"As far as economy flights go this was pretty good. Plane was clean, staff were pleasent and polite. <br>This was a very full flight. i could only see a few empty seats.<br>The food service was very efficient and overall the food was very good.<br><br>My only wish is that they did not pile the seats with pillows and blankets. Its a real juggle trying to find somewhere to put them if you are not using them.<br><br>The inflight entertainment needs a bit of work, with the options in English i found to be very slim. Not a great problem for me really as i tend to read when i fly but a good movie is a nice option on an 8 hour flight"
353,KathySouthMorang,5,Excellent airline. Staff are great. No hiccups with their flights. Would highly recommend Vietnam airlines.
353,sydneysider48,4,"We have now flown with Vietnam Airlines a number of times over the years and have always found the checkin, quality, service, comfort and punctuality very good and the food quite acceptable."
353,JimmyMayer,5,"Went last time 2 years ago from Hong Kong to Danang and was a disappointment all the way (luggage allowance, service, food, attitude, etc.).<br>Expected similar this time due to October holidays but what a surprise...regular luggage allowance, brand new plane, extremely helpful and friendly staff, good food and even wine (white wine chilled!) with second and third(!) offerings. What a change. Can only highly recommend. Return flight was a similar good experience. Probably worthwhile to consider the very nice configured business class for next time."
353,joongyc,4,"Took the overnight Flight from Singapore - Ho Chi Min-Osaka. Flight from Sin to HCM is airbus, whereas the connecting from HCM to Osaka is Dreamliner. Overall, the flight is pleasant, seating is spacious. Service / meal is good. Flight schedule on time to and fro."
354,Keith F,4,"We opted for business class as it included the baggage allowance we had with us, and we found the prices reasonable enough. It included an express skip through the security checks (our only issue, we had no idea this was a thing, or where it was... could have been pointed out better) - and entry to the lounge where we had a choice of fruits, pho and other snacks and drinks with some wifi.<br>The flights itself was very nice with lovely staff and some nice food.<br><br>We also flew from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, this time in Economy and it was very nice. no issues faced here.<br><br>There are cheaper airlines, so it is worth shopping around - also, keep an eye on flight times the day ahead.<br><br>And in Hanoi, make sure to go to Domestic Terminal....its a bus trip from the main!"
354,P&amp;L,4,My flight was at 16:00.<br>I had check in in sky priority desk.<br>All went well easy and smooth.<br>Boarding and take off on time.<br>Nice take off and smooth landing.<br>Crew was friendly and well take care of the passengers.<br>I had happy and enjoyable trip.
354,ruvisen,4,I flew with Vietnam Airlines from Hanoi to Saigon. It was a great flight experience. Extremely tidy and friendly staff. Good leg space. But the food was bit basic and inflight entertainment needs to improve
354,P&amp;L,4,"I took morning flight VN220 (08:05). Easy and smooth checking.<br>Boarding and departure on time.<br>Nice take off and landing.<br>Stuards were hospitable and friendly but did not check carefully where all the passengers had fastened their sit-belts before take off.<br>Only one issue that I was one of the 10 or 12 last passengers from the airplane so we had to wait few minutes under sunlight (good that I had apply sun cream before  go to the airport) because there was no bus for us. <br><br>Otherwise, I had very nice and pleasant flight with vietnam airlines."
354,theflyingdoctor,4,"The trip to the beaches of Phu Quoc is only 35 minutes in the air . <br> We checked in without undue difficulty. We were asked what type of seats we wanted which was nice. 2 aisles please. We got an aisle and a middle without explanation.<br> The flight was on time at a pier so no bussing. Pleasant welcome on board by cabin staff. Decor light blue and white  ( Europeans may recognise a particularly nasty blue and yellow colour scheme- this was mikes better), Leg room on the tight side but no worse than BA. During the short trip, complimentary soft drinks were served.<br> Baggage retrieval process fine.<br> All in all the standard was higher than on most western airlines that seem to work very focus on their bottom lines. I never thought I would prefer to fly Vietnam Airlines than BA but on this evidence there is a clear winner."
355,Robert M,1,I have been in some poor airline lounges around the world...but the food in the VN domestic lounge in DaNang is simply terrible. Poor quality and completely unappetising.
355,MJS,5,"Great service, food was fantastic, upgraded to Premium Economy on the way home which was about $280 but worth it for the 3-4 hours sleep on an overnight flight. If you go PE choose the side seats as there are only 2 not middle"
355,Brian H,4,"There are two distinct aspects of my review, the actual flights but also late rescheduling of flights.<br><br>The flights themselves were great, just as you would expect and would use again. However, rescheduling after the three centre holiday was booked is another issue.<br><br>In March 2018 we booked six Vietnamese Airlines flights for a holiday in Cambodia and Vietnam. The week prior to departure, in early November 2018, they changed their schedules.  We effectively lost two half days, and missed seeing Hanoi in daylight altogether. Two hour waits between connecting flights became six hours, and a leisurely noon departurer came forward by four hours, resulting in an early start.<br><br>Not the end of the World, but I would not have booked the six original flights had the timing been as was subsequently changed. Arriving in Hanoi late at night, and leaving early in the morning with no chance for sightseeing is a waste of time; two half days would have made all the difference."
355,Orator11,4,"We travelled from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh, and on to Da Lat, and back on the return sectors.<br><br>On all four flights, service was good and crew were excellent.<br><br>Foodwise, it was ordinary fare, with two choices, but cabin service was smooth."
355,Ricky Faust (London),3,Nice new clean aircraft but cabin crew quite rude. 20 mins into flight no gin available. In flight entertainment quality on such a new aircraft very disappointing.  Poor quality headphones.
356,tom t,3,"Our premium economy seats were spacious and comfortable but the food and service were no better than economy. The staff seemed to be simply going through the motions and requests, although ultimately met, seemed to be an imposition. We accepted that there may be cultural differences but the staff of an airline operating in Australia should at least try to engage with passengers and perhaps try a smile every now and then."
356,Mark W,5,"On our recent trip to Vietnam we flew with Vietnam Airlines to and from Melbourne in Business Class and economy for four domestic flights.  I can't fault the airline at all.  All staff, from check in to the cabin crew were excellent.  The airplanes are modern and comfortable and the choice and quality of the food also great. It is obvious that the airline is working hard to be a premium airline and absolutely deserve to be called premium. I would definitely choose to fly with Vietnam Airlines again should they fly to the destination I was going to."
356,Katrina E,5,"I'm not sure if there is only 1 airline in Vietnam that does domestic flights, but anyway, Vietnam Airlines was quite impressive. Clean airplane, good service and prompt with the schedules. Also, the airport in Da Nang was very clean. Another added bonus!"
356,donandkeo,3,"Delayed for over 40 minutes without any announcement or explanation. Seats OK for this short trip.p Only a bottle of water, without food. It was not as good as Lao was on the way."
356,Alison A,5,"The first thing I have to say is I left my iPad on the return flight into Melbourne. It was a bit of a hassle to work out how to contact Vietnam Airlines in Melbourne. I eventually found the phone number for their head office in Sydney. A wonderful person from the Tickets &amp; Reservations Office emailed their Melbourne Airport team and CC’d me in. My iPad had been handed in by ground staff and I got it back with in a few days. <br>As for the flight. My husband and I flew business class. It was wonderful to have a flat bed, they are a little hard though. I don’t know if other airlines offer some padding for when you want to sleep?<br>The service was good and the food was excellent. Movie &amp; TV choices weren’t fabulous. I recommend you download something yourself that you want to watch before you fly, or take a good book. <br>Connecting flights were a long wait in Ho Chi Min City airport. 7 hrs on the way to London.15 hrs on the return flight. The Lotus lounge was quite nice, but lounges aren’t comfortable to have a nap on. We hired two sleep boxes in the airport for 8 hrs on out return trip (rather than the hassle of getting Visa to leave the airport for a few hrs). They are $7 US per hr. Each Sleep Box has (once again) very hard single beds and were quite bright and noisy. Luckily I took my eye mask and ear plugs and managed to sleep on and off for about 6 hrs. All in all it was a great trip with Vietnam Airlines."
357,Elizabeth Q,3,"I was unsure what to expect from Vietnam Airlines but they were reasonably good. The cabin seating was single seats at the sides and pairs down the middle. There didn't appear to be any privacy screens for the double seats. The worst thing was the TV screens that have to be pulled out to view, when they are replaced the impact on the seat in front is quite considerable. Apparently the fleet is new, but I don't think the planes are actually new. The seat,when in the full bed position the angle seemed slightly odd and its quite narrow. The flight attendants are attentive but some are hard to understand. The food and drink was good. The toilets are some of the smallest I have encountered particularly in Business Class. The flight left and landed right on time. The Lotus Lounge at Hanoi is a miserable place and gets too full. The choice of food and drink is very poor.It was difficult to find the Business Class check-in desk at Hanoi."
357,Nadheera D,3,"I was told by many that this airline is good, but that expectation was never met. My return flight was Premium economy. Although leg space was good for a person who is 5 foot and staff were professional, the food was pretty average especially on the Premium economy flight.<br>I flew from Sydney to Hanoi. But as there are no direct flights I had to go to Ho Chi Minh City and get a domestic flight from there.I had 2 hours lay over which I thought was enough. I had to go through immigration, get the baggage and go through customs, then walk over to the domestic terminal in the searing heat and go through security checks again. When I got out of the plane there were people putting stickers on to transit passenger. I thought that this would give us a separate queue for immigration. Not so. I was on the line for 15 minutes and then more time to get my bags. Then as i walked out some people checked the tickets and collected the baggage and asked the passengers to walk to the domestic terminal. It was very crowded and there was no one to actually direct transit passengers (which would have been the sensible thing to do). Anyway after asking a couple of people I arrived upstairs in a hall full of people with several very long queues and no staff to ask anything. Eventually I asked a guard at the priority line who waved me to the end of one of the long queues. it took over 45 minutes of standing in extremely hot room full of people to get to the security check. WORST AIRLINE EXPERIENCE I've EVER HAD! Eventually I managed to get to the boarding gate at the end of boarding line and then it got worse. We were taken by bus to the plane and had to climb up steps!<br><br>I also took 2 other domestic flights from Hanoi - Da nang and Da Nang - Ho Chi Minh City. Every time the passengers had to go up or down steps (once in pouring rain) and get into a bus to get to the airport. This is not easy for an older person with arthritic knees!"
357,Drmaing,3,"I actually made an almost round trip from Hongkong to Vientian then Vientian to Incheon via Hongkong.<br>First, two of my flights eere by bus to airplane to save gate cost(?): need to be fixed, very inconvient to old people and heavy luggage carrier.<br>Hanoi lounge service was below expectation and receptionists were nit helpful at all.<br>In flght service was OK.<br>A-350 business seat was ackward and worst business seat i have ever flown.<br>Overall they need a lot of improvements and polishments to be come a classy airline."
357,Quentin V,5,"The flight was on time, with a great boarding experience (well organised at the gate). <br>The service on the flight was great, and the entertainment were as you could expect it from a long carrier flight."
357,Juleigh B,2,"Very disappointing even in premium,  Would not fly with again .  Had a long stop over and the airport did not have much on offer."
358,Valerie F,4,Nice airline to fly with this is my second time flying with them and my overall impression very good.Seats a bit narrow but that seems to be one of the handicaps of flying economy.Food was excellent and the service first rate I was unfortunate to have two crying infants on this overnight flight so didnt get any sleep.Cabin crew were excellent and the lavatories were clean and functional.
358,Vinod P,5,"Booked our Holiday with Flight Centre (25/10/18 to 07/11/18) and they booked our flights to Siem Reap,Cambodia via Ho Chi Minch City and than from Siem Reap to Hoi An (Da Nang) &amp; from Da Nang to Hanoi and return flight from Hanoi via Ho Chi Minch City to Melbourne. <br>All flights were booked using Vietnam Airlines. All flights were on schedule (except one), approx. 30 minutes delay. All their aircrafts are clean and modern. Lots of space and the service provided by their ground staff including aircrew were very friendly and excellent. Meals were very good and of high quality."
358,mattdouhan,5,"Second time on Vietnam air and I have to say they are amazing, the new A350 business class seats are as good as any but what really impressed me is the service, it is second to none from checking to lounge to flight, I am quickly becoming a very loyal customer"
358,dpgFlorida,3,"I flew on a couple of domestic flights in November 2018.  Their website is easy to use.  I canceled and rebooked a flight without any difficulty, just a $15 fee.  I was notified by email of a (small) change in flight times.  The planes were old and noisy, but fine for short flights.  They left on time."
358,Shere,5,"Always happy with Vietnam Airlines flighf, on time, comfortable, fast and safe. The staff was really nice and helpful!"
359,mariam,1,"I am very disappointed with this airline.<br>Flight was delay 5,5 hours without any explanation.<br>Flight of a total 17 hours only offered 2 food services, very poor quantity, and they didn't have nothing to offer between the meals. We were 10 hours without any food option.<br>Toilets were not cleaned even once, the last hour was quiet disgusting to go to the toilet."
359,Basil456,1,"Oh, so close!<br>I would have given this airline 5 stars for the service, food and everything else, BUT.......<br>We booked four flights in total for our trip to Vietnam, including two internal flights.<br>Flight out, great. No issues. Then they changed the times of our two internal flights, with no reason or explanation given. This severely impacted on our holiday as we couldn't make one rearranged flight as we were getting off a two night cruise in Halong bay. Long story short, I had to pay for and extra night at the Hanoi hotel to compensate. The second flight change cost us 5 hours sightseeing time in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) when we only had two days there to start with.<br>I booked all my flights 6 MONTHS before the holiday and we were notified of the change three weeks before. <br>To add further annoyance, the flights that we were originally on, still flew. It appears we were simply just bumped off. The airline ignored my emails asking for clarification on the situation and gave no explanation. When I originally booked the planes were more than half empty, so what was their criteria for bumping us? Gave our seats to locals perhaps? Who knows, as they never had the decency to explain to us their reasons."
359,Sujan Gautam,4,"I had travel from Singapore to Hanoi and vice versa via Vietnam Airlines. I had paid almost the double price in what other budget airlines were offering the ticket because of all the positive reviews  and was also termed as a 4 star airlines on skytrax, Check in was good but the lady at check in counter was not so good and seems rude thus the initial experience was bad. Boarding was efficient and crew were good enough. One of the crew member offered me to take all the vacant seat available at the last row. How good gesture it was by her. <br>Pros:<br>Leg space was decent<br>Driks were offered regularly<br><br>Cons:<br>Food was horrible<br>They don't provide whisky in beverage section.<br>No IFE thus very difficult to spent 3,5 hours of flight time.<br>Not enough duty free items (I ordered 4 numbers of sunglasses but only available 2 at the board)"
359,Pixie16,5,This my first Vietnam Airlines flight and I  was very impressed.  We were on an A320 and it was very comfortable and spacious. On time for both departure and arrivals.  On board meal was fine.  Tip: was much cheaper to book in the Vietnam Airlines website than other travel website.
359,C073,3,"We used Vietnam Airlines for a round trip SIN-SGN-HAN-BKK. In-flight service was okay but there was a noticeable difference between the service of the ground staff for the domestic leg SGN - HAN and the international leg from HAN - BKK. There were three check-in counters lit up in SGN's domestic terminal where we were told to queue up, however, only one was manned when we arrived. The lady behind it served one more passenger group before us and then put up the closed sign and disappeared. There were other staff members who sat behind the lit up counters but also they had the closed sign up. The queue was getting longer and longer but nobody seemed to care until I went up to one of the staff and vented my frustration because by then we had been standing at the front of the queue for a good 15 minutes. The lady behind the counter pretended not to take notice of me but was yelling at some other staff, presumably to organize some other staff to reopen one position because she was busy with something else. After another 5 minutes, another staff arrived and attended to us with a rudeness I have hardly ever experienced in such a situation before. I thought this was worth mentioning to a supervisor and went to a desk with some people who looked like they were of a higher rank. Again I was ignored and when I asked again, one guy just pointed to a office and walked away in that direction. I waited another 5 minutes and gave up."
360,Brian P,2,"When booking on-line direct with Vietnam Airlines recently for a flight from Saigon to Siem Reap (Cambodia), I was quoted a fare of $128 US (One way) which I was quite happy with considering the flight is only an hour and ten minutes.<br><br>I expected to pay some taxes of course, but in my experience this usually only amounts to maybe 10% for 'Airport Tax' and maybe 5% for 'Passenger Service Fees' , so I was expecting the final cost to be around $150 US tops.<br><br> Imagine my surprise to discover the taxes amounted to 100% of the original fare. That's right, the 'Tax &amp; Airport Tax' was $109 US and the 'Passenger Service Fee' $19 US. Coincidentally, a total of $128 US or precisely DOUBLE the original fare quoted. So instead of paying around $150 US I was slugged $256 US !<br><br>I find it ironic that the Socialist Government of Vietnam could so readily embrace the tax grabbing tactics of the bourgeois west."
360,nic_diver,3,"12 hours to Ho Chi Min for an onward connecting flight to PHnom Phen, check in was prompt, quick and easy so major positive there. Seat pitch and comfort was decent, not brilliant for 12 hours static but have flown in worse. <br><br>Staff all came across as courteous and helpful. Disappointed with diner out of Heathrow, sitting towards rear of flight main choice of food had already ‘run out’ leaving me no choice at all if I wished to eat. That was a let down, apologies given and promises of starting from the rear when breakfast is served to placate the disappointment. Naturally they must have forgotten they’d said that and served the next meal in the same order, fortunately I did obtain my 1st choice.<br><br>Not an airline up there with the best, however to be fair far from the worse too, I would use them again dependent on route etc."
360,SESNoVA,4,"1-2 hour flights on Vietnam Airlines are fine. Clean, if cramped cabins, friendly staff, efficient baggage handling, and ontime flights. Don’t expect food, snacks, or even drink options beyond tea/coffee/water, and expect very tight quarters for knees and legs."
360,pmr0bins,4,"We actually flew Premium, but this option is not listed.    Although the plane was new and we flew in the Dreamliner Premium cabin of just 33 seats, the one complaint we have is that on both outbound and inbound flights there was a 9 hour gap between meals.     During this period we have been given a small bottle of water each, and the crew came round with one small fruit drink.     <br><br>Fortunately I always have some snack in my hold-all but nevertheless we felt this was far too long a gap compared with other airlines we have recently flown with."
360,Glenise S,5,"On this holiday, we flew with Vietnam Airlines, 3 domestic &amp; 2 international flights.All were great flights, easy check-in, even changed flight to earlier flight, the staff were very efficient, had no problems &amp; will definitely recommend Vietnam Airlines."
361,zelal25,5,"This was my first experience on Vietnam airlines. Good surprise, as the A350 was very clean, very new. Great legroom. Excellent food, with a friendly and open service. Good selection of movies. Luggage delivered rapidly.<br>I would take it again!"
361,BellePerth_Australia,5,"I travelled from Paris to Hanoi on the Dreamliner 787, and changed to an airbus for the flight from Hanoi to Singapore.  The 787 business class has pod type seating which is very comfortable and, as well, provides privacy. The food was exquisite, mouth watering, and it just kept coming, so you well nourished. The staff were polite, professional and caring, a delight. My only gripe were the in-flight films which seemed to be aimed at one demographic and were heavily sub-titled.<br>The airbus does not have the same level of comfort, though still very roomy, and the flight was only 3 hours, so there was not the same need to stretch out as on the long haul flight. But the hospitality never flagged. The value was unbelievable, all this for literally half the cost of other airlines."
361,malrogers60,5,A fantastic experience on a very modern plane. The service was second to none and the cost of the return flight was so competitive. We will definitely fly with these guys again and again
361,Alan P,4,"Seats 2DG middle seats in a 1-2-1 configuration.  Seats are fully flat bed equipped with well thought out storage facilities.  Useful amenities kit.  Lunch ex FRA was very good with adequate choice western or Vietnamese mains.  Breakfast into SGN was timely and appropriate.<br>Part of the deal was an hotel during the 16 hour stopover for the flight onto Sydney; perfect for us as retirees.  We were met off flight in SGN escorted to Visa area where Visas were arranged then escorted through Immigration and Customs and put aboard transport to a nearby hotel for the day.  Comfortable hotel room and achieved a good rest and refresh before pick-up in the evening at 1830 for a 2100 departure to Sydney.  Lunch and dinner provided at hotel if required, plus a complimentary city tour.  (All part of fare).<br>Flight to SYD very comfortable - seats 3DG - with dinner ex SGN and breakfast into SYD.  Entertainment adequate, much the same as many other airlines.<br>Would have appreciated being able to get a cookie with my cup of tea mid flight - open sandwiches always available, but not a simple cookie/biscuit."
361,Fiona P,5,"Right from check in the experience was stress free and organised. From the moment we sat down in comfy seats we were given a cold towel from a friendly hostess. Flight was on time, cool drinks served and overall one of the best Airlines I have travelled with. Wouldn't think twice about booking again"
362,Joel m,3,"It’s on time clean and cheap basically it’s you get what you pay for,no frills but we felt it was ok"
362,Kevin D,4,"After reading many reviews to say the flights from london to Vietnam where uncomfortable I have to report ours were not. We did however have emergency exit seats in botch directions so may be untypical.<br>Staff very friendly, lots to drink to help sleep if you wish. First flights in a Dreamliner, more used to A380s but the Boeing was fine. <br>Both directions were night flights and managed to get some sleep.<br>Mela service offered a choice of European or oriental. <br>Only suggestions are to take your own ear plus and eye blinds as this airline did not seem to stock them, although they do offer the usual disposable toothbrush and also disposable slippers.<br>The flights were also very good value for money at approx £500 return from LHR to Hanoi, returning from HCMC to London. Finally both ways were direct flights ...much better than changing en route adding the extra couple of hours somewhere like Dubai , Qatar etc. <br>Highly recommended for the money."
362,Eva Voegerl,4,"Unlike other online reviews, we warmly could recommend Vietnam Airlines. As we had cheap tickets, we didn’t expect much of the flight, however we were surprised very positively: the flight was convenient, no delay and exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.<br>The airplane itself might be a bit old-fashioned, but it perfectly served its purpose."
362,Worldwidediner,5,"Staff were great, loads of legroom for me being 6ft 4. Light snack which i did not eaat due to doet ""no nuts"" ""no sugar""<br>Family enjoyed their flight. A very comfortable flight with smooth landing.<br>Airport was fantastic"
362,forshara,5,"I was most impressed with the comfort of this plane.  The leg room and the seat size were like planes from 20 years ago with US carriers before they started downsizing to accommodate more people.  The staff was excellent.  Check in was a breeze.  The flight was on-time.  It was a quick, one hour flight so only water and Coca-Cola were offered."
363,Diane J,5,"Following our APT river cruise we flew home to UK in Business Class with Vietnam Airlines. We were welcomed onboard with a glass of champagne and a warm towel from a smiling crew. Departure time was 00.50 and would be a 13 hour flight. As it was so late we were too tired to eat dinner so we adjusted the seat into a very comfortable flat bed. We slept most of the night, just the visits to the bathroom and we awoke 1 1/2 away from Heathrow when we were served with breakfast.<br>I would highly recommend Vietnam Airlines after having flown 3 times with them. The crew were very professional and friendly and the seating and flat bed very comfortable"
363,jasonmgan,4,"We recently flew to Cambodia and Vietnam via Vietnam Airlines.  We were pleasantly surprised on the newness of the plane in comparison to our own Local provider.  The Team were nice, though looked exhausted upon entering and leaving the flight.  The seats were fairly small, as due to our more European stature, were shoulder to shoulder the entire flight, though leg room was more than acceptable.  The seats in a reclined position, was comfortable, as the seat of the chair also raised causing less tension under the legs.  For the first time ordering a Gluten Free option, was very good, as other top end airlines have been barely edible.  Overall a pleasant experience."
363,letchemi,4,The flight was on time. The take off and landing was excellent. The food was not good. I did not have my supper as they ran out of my choice. The staff did not try to see whether they could offer me other options. Keep insisting that there is no rice but only noodles. The crew members spoke very limited English or no English at all.  As the staff spoke very limited English there was not much interaction with crew and passengers.<br> The entertainment was good. The ground crew at check in were very good and helpful.
363,Eva Kovacic,5,We took a domestic flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh and everything was perfect. The flight was on time and we arrived even 15min earlier than scheduled. The plane looked new and the crew was really kind. We got water/pepsi/cola. It was just an one and a half hour flight so I didn’t expect much from service. Would definitely choose them again.
363,TrevorPowis,5,"Well there we go another trip to my favorite place Sai Gon.<br>This time I decided to try Vietnam Airlines and was not disappointed.  Usual carrier AirAsia with no frills and a stop each way.<br>Flying direct is the go I decided. <br>Pay a bit more and have some comfort I thought.  Well I got to tell you  this was a great decision. <br>The flight over was on the 'Skyteam' 350-900 aircraft,  magnificent plane. For economy there was heaps of seating room (I am 184-6'2"") full movie screen and a great choice of movies to watch. Smooth flying all the way. Only took round just over 8 hrs fly time. Could not fault the onboard service. Returned on a 350-900.<br> A great flight again.<br>They will be getting my business again in April next year for sure. <br>Trev Powis Australia"
364,daphne h,4,"We flew Premium Economy to London via Hanoi and found everything about the service excellent.  However, on our return from London to Sydney with a stopover in Saigon we found the service not so good.  The cabin crew on our return were certainly not as efficient as our outward journey.  They allowed passengers to leave their screens, etc out as we were coming in to land.  They also allowed passengers to have their carry-on luggage in front of them.  Overall we were happy with the flight and service we received just would have liked to have seen the same level of service on our return flight."
364,cskot,4,Good service and pleasant staff. Check in went smoothly. Seats were okay although inflight movies were old and out of date.
364,QuanLee,4,"For any flights in Vietnam, the most concern should be timing. lucky for me, my flight was on time even it might be the last flight of the day, nearly 22:00. The service on flight were nice. the flight attendants were helpful when accepted for me to change the seat cause i do not feel comfortable when sit by the emergency exist."
364,Graham L,4,"As a frequent member of a well know Australian Airline, I had an opportunity to fly with Vietnam airlines, for a change, and to my surprise was very pleasantly surprised.<br>First impression's are always so important, and boarding a virtual brand new Airbus A350-900, all new composite technology aircraft was a pleasing revelation.<br>The next revelation after sitting down was the amount of leg room offered. Way more than I am used to with my regular airline. The plane was very stable in flight, and was enjoyed immensely. <br>Service a food was excellent, great presentation, wine a beer offered free. Crew were excellent, in fact I have to say I could not fault anything.<br>So why not give them a try, you may be pleasantly surprised."
364,glenda/john,4,"This was an overnight from Saigon to Melbourne, so we flew Premium Economy (Seat11)<br>The flight leaves around 9.30 p.m.and because of the 4 hour time difference, gets into Melbourne about 9.30 the following morning....flight time about 8 hours 15 min.<br>An evening meal and breakfast is served and with a few hours sleep one arrives feeling fine at destination. The aircraft is a late model A350.<br>When flying Vietnam Airlines be aware that they do not do Premium economy domestically. Probably not a worry as flights do not take long."
365,gaad,5,"Four sisters flew from Melbourne to Da Nang and return recently with Vietnam Airlines.  Very happy with everything.<br>They flew new planes - an A350 up and a 787 Dreamliner back.  Slight delay in a connection at Ho Chi Minh city but no big deal.<br><br>Also we tried our luck with Optiontown - looked for one spare seat between two of us on the way up - successful, and really pleased that our request for two spare seats alongside each of us in the way back was also successful - enabled a few hours' sleep and lots of room. Cost was minimal. Maybe we were lucky that cabins weren't full but, a good deal"
365,Sid_m_DE,4,"Comfort, inflight entertainment,customer service,food,seats, overall a five-star experience. Seats are excellent and was a modern aircraft in service, menu offers a variety of food with great collection of beverages to choose from . Staffs were polite and professional in their work."
365,Great_Oren,5,"A very good airline service, and as a tall person (1.87m) I found that even in Economy there was plenty of leg room. The food choices were also excellent."
365,Eve S,4,"Excellent flight.  Very comfortable.  Plenty of legroom. Large plane, on time and very efficient.  Great price."
365,Zareh S,4,I have just got on this plane and I must say it’s worth paying the extra for premier economy I’ll let you know what the rest the fly was like but at the moment I can’t not fault it
366,Kopi S,4,"It was my first time taking Vietnam Airline in Oct 2018. Overall experience was good and not fantastic. Air crew was serving with smile. In flight food is average. In flight Entertaintment was the only flaw on this flight. There is no personal screen for each seat, we had just one miserable 10inch screen for every 6 seats installed next to the <br>reading light on top of us. The best thing I would say is the price I paid. Vietnam airline is a full fledge airline and the national carrier of Vietnam but charging at close to budget airline prices. You will get 30kg baggage check in as well. (Most airlines offer up to 23kg only)."
366,Roland UK,4,"really good service from london to HCMC. However there was a terminal change for domestic that you have to ""do yourself"" and its not really that well integrated leading me to get lost. Otherwise fast and efficient."
366,Geoff Y,3,Having flown many times with Vietnam Airlines it is disappointing to find that the service is now only what the cabin crew need to do and no more. The food has definitely declined in quality. Outbound my seat in premium economy had the base come adrift. Looking around the cabin I noticed other items that really should have been maintained. Rather odd that the aircraft was a 787. On the return leg again thefiid was basic. Having accepted a cup of coffee the flight attendant hands the cup back to and walks away without giving me time to obtain milk and sugar. Breakfast prior to landing in Sydney I decided on eggs and sausages which can only be described as inedible. Sad.
366,Travel791324,5,Very comfortable will as for more leg room next time as we are tall.. Excellent service highly recommended also very attentive  food was very enjoyable..
366,Karen,3,"It is great to be flying direct, the plane is fine but the food is not good, the drinks are probably the cheapest you can find and the movies are old.  The service is fine, they do what they need to and no more, it is not cold or warm service, just fine. <br>Would I fly with them again? Yes to go direct but no for everything else."
367,OldDownHouse,4,"Upgraded to Premium Economy for 150 pp (Cash!!)<br>Probably worth it - just<br>Bigger seats; more room but everything else looked the same<br>787 Dreamliner; so comfy plane; good service<br>Nothing to shout about, but what one would expect.<br>Left late - but I think that is LHR and arrived less late.<br>Would certainly be happy to use them again; but at the end of the day it's a means of transport not a life event.  We arrived in the right place roughly on time having sat comfortably for 11 1/2 hours - so it did the job"
367,LeahM,5,We had a great experience with our first time flying with Vietnam Airlines.  Our check-in at the airport went smoothly and we were asked if we wanted to sit in exit rows so that my boyfriend and I could stay together.  The flight left on time with no issues. There was also a delightful in-flight meal we didn't expect! Definitely recommended for your future travels!
367,bajabirdy,4,"The flight from SGN to CRX lasts only 45 minutes, so most of our friends fly economy. But we really think that we get our money's worth flying in Business Class. The seats are wider and the service is excellent. Upon boarding, guests are given a choice of juices or water. During the flight, soft drinks, water, or beer are available. We enjoy this hour of pampering. But the real benefits of flying Business are four: 1. Dedicated check-in counter; 2. VIP priority security line; 3. having access to the lovely lounge in Saigon, where hot and cold food are available as well as a variety of beverages including beer and French wine; and 4.  luggage is first off the plane upon landing."
367,Stephen H,4,"Return trip to Vietnam with on flight to Hong Kong. Flew Vietnam Airlines on all four legs. Their staff are a delight, planes from Sydney to HoChi Minh and return are the new Boeing Dreamliners, in my opinion the best commercial aircraft flying today. A smooth comfortable flight with attentive polite and obliging cabin crew.<br>Highly recommend Vietnam Airlines."
367,fmuehlhans,4,"Good value for money, friendly staff in cabin and on ground! I did check in online and just dropped my baggage at the airport. There was no waiting at the drop off counter for luggage as most of the travellers were checking in at the airport."
368,James W,5,"This is a great airline, with excellent service. I had five flights altogether while visiting Vietnam and couldn't fault any of my flights."
368,Tony Shepherd,4,"Great flight but the problem was it boarded on time and we sat for 30 minutes before given clearance to taxi the airline is working well it is ground services that need a kick up the backside, many people blame VN Airlines for delays but I can say in most cases it is not at all their fault"
368,andyjayne4,5,"We got a return flight from Heathrow to Hanoi, and admittedly was slightly apprehensive having booked the flight because it was very cheap but the only airline to fly direct. However we couldn’t fault anything on either flight so am surprised to see negative reviews. Both flights departed and arrived on time to the minute which is very rare! The Dreamliner aircraft was clean, comfortable and spacious, film entertainment ok and food was nice too. Staff also great. Overall this was fantastic value for money and really recommend Vietnam airlines for this trip. We also got two domestic flights from Hanoi to Hue and Denang to Hanoi which we’re both equally as punctual and of high standard."
368,Nicholas B,1,"Our plane was delayed by 3 hours, we didnt know what was happening and no one was interested in helping us out. We missed our connecting flight to brisbane and they firstly told us its not their problem, and when we pushed the issue they stright up ignored us. Their customer service online is woeful, and their general attitude is crap.<br>Lucky for us virgin airlines picked up the pieces and chaged our flight to a later one once we told them the story. <br>At first i thought they were pretty good, but they showed their colours when things started to go slightly wrong.<br> It pays to spend a little more and get on a DECENT airline. I know we will next time!"
368,Declan S,1,"Of All of my flights with vietnam airlines this month, not one has been on time. Not one. The last so delayed my connecting flight was gone and the next they could get me on a full 12 hours later. Their response wasn't helpful and communication throughout was patchy. May as well fly with a budget airline next time."
369,harmony807,4,Generally the service was good with attentive staff and expedient service of meals. The meals were not as good as on other airlines and fairly small. We had a few issues with changed flight times - we had 3 internal flights and because I have the app “Trip Case” we were able to be notified of the changes by email. Thank goodness for the App!<br>Our later flight was cancelled and we were put onto an earlier flight which we could have missed without that App. The check in process and staff were good and very accommodating..
369,Avinash K,5,Very good flight. Worth the money. Good inflight meal served. Onboard staff very polite helpful and courteous. Highly recommended
369,William R,4,"Vietnam Airlines overall has a very good service.  I agree with David R, that the prices they have are very good, and the onboard service and staff was very good.  Check in process was also good and very rigorous.  My only complaint was in the boarding process.  There was absolutely no priority boarding nor was the signage at the departure gates.  I would definitely recommend the airline"
369,David R,5,"1st flight with VN, and will definitely travel with them again.  Yes it's 4 star, but the price &amp; the service was 5 star.<br>The service whilst waiting at Saigon for our LHR flight was excellent - free visa, transfers, hotel with meal @ a 5 star hotel in the centre of town - great to walk around and re-orient ourselves with Saigon."
369,ValorieZ,5,Flew for the first time on Vietnam Airlines from Thailand to Vietnam <br>Flight was on time and all employees were pleasant and professional
370,corrapaola,4,"We took a very short flight so could not experience a lot about service and entertainment, but the flight was on time and the service good"
370,Warren I,3,Nothing incredible. Old aircraft advertising great new A350 while we flew in old crate. Don't expect anything amazing.
370,JWphotog,4,"I was impressed with Vietnam Airlines.  On time schedules, good cabin crew, clean planes, decent food.  A bit pricier than other ""local"" airlines, but they include baggage and a snack and drinks."
370,MatthewWinfield1,5,"Excellent service by attentive crew members all looking professional and very courteous. In flight entertainment was very good, charging stations at every seat, and a food offering that puts most airlines to shame. In a word impressive."
370,manhchu,5,"I and our company team had a good flight with Vietnam airlines. We depatured from Hanoi to Bangkok. It depatured on time. I feel scrarery when it take off and land but with Vietnam airlines I feel very comfortable. It landed very nice. The staff were great, they serve very careful. The food was food. After 5 days in Thailand just have Thai food, when the crew serve meal on plane I really interested in Vietnamese food. The meal was the best meal incompare with the meals in Thailand. I definitely flight with Vietnam again. Great job!"
371,John B,5,We flew with Vietnam Airlines from London to Hi Chi Minh and I have to say the service was excellent all the crew were very helpful and polite the food was very good and the flight itself was excellent. We also flew with them on flights to Hanoi and Bangkok and even on short flights like these we still were given a full meal not like European airlines who are only interested in selling you scratch cards and crappy sandwiches they could learn a lot from Vietnam Airlines all in all an excellent airline to fly with and I will happily go with them again
371,MhPitt,5,We had previously used Vietnam Airlines from Bangkok to Hanoi and no hesitation in using them again.Flight crew were pleasant and we had a smooth flight.Business class was probably more premium economy but still very good for the  price we paid.
371,Andrew C,5,"Our flight from Da Nang to Hanoi was just 55 minutes but it was first class all the way. A warm welcome, a cool drink, a delicious lunch - what more could one want? <br><br>Highly recommend travelling on Vietnam Airlines!"
371,Jeff S,5,"The joys of flying up front. A bed, A better food and drink selection, Your own seat. Attention to detail. They are new to the game, but will fly with them again. The lounges in Vietnam are a bit rough, but it is still an up and coming country, and they are trying."
371,mikef888au,4,"This was operated by Vietnam Airlines, and promoted as VietJet, I suppose their low cost alternative for their local market.<br>Everything went like clockwork, and the flight was remarkably uneventful......that's what you want!. The cabin crew were of a high standard and very pretty / handsome. We were served a chicken sandwich each and drinks on this short flight, and landing was a perfect 3 pointer.<br>The plane was a twin jet A321, everything worked, and it was clean.<br>Keep up the great work VietJet!"
372,fritzmollie,3,Not a big choice of food and a poor selection of films.  The beds had that annoying join under the hip which the older lie flat beds have.  The cabin crew were helpful.
372,smartfamily62,4,"We flew business class from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city, and then premium economy back to London. Generally, all good, nice airline, staff good and helpful, an internationally competitive experience . However as we had a long stop over in Ho Chi Minh city wanted to use business class lounge to freshen up, and thought as we had travelled from Sydney by business class,  were 'Lotusmiles' (their 'Airmile' equivalent) members and willing to pay if necessary this would not be a problem. We had contacted Vietnam air in advance to see if this was possible but did not get a response. We were refused entry at any cost on the day, unless we paid circa £800 supplement each to travel business back to the UK, but did manage to find another lounge where we could pay to stay.<br><br>So no customer service flexibility from them, worth bearing in mind if you fly Vietnam airlines. Shame really as only issue in all the flights I have had with them."
372,Olaf J,4,"The flight was with a rather new A350 aircraft. The cabin is very spacious and quiet. Distance between the Eco class seats was quite comfortable , even for me as a more than average sized person. Same for the width of the seat. The entertainment system worked perfectly fine and had a lot to offer. Newest Hollywood movies and lot of new and old stuff from all over the world. The music catalog was huge too. Unfortunately the flight time was too shot. On board catering was much better than the average e.g. Chinese Airlines. Flight attendees were nice and so super artificial friendly. Two days before departure I was informed by e-mail that the flight is delayed (by the influence of a typhoon I guess) which is a good service.<br>I also had a number of domestic flights in Vietnam which were not that comfortable but still recommendable."
372,2015Family6,5,"Surprised by the high service standard Vietnam Airline is delivering for 1/2 of SQ prices. Food is good, more importantly the service from the stewardesses are exceptional; not only they speak native Vietnamese, they can communicate in English, Chinese and Korean too. <br><br>Flight is on time!  Well done!"
372,Joan M,5,"I had a lovely flight starting with the warm and helpful young lady on the check in counter. I expressed that I would appreciate some leg room as I am tall, and she happily gave me an exit row.  They were extremely busy, but nothing was too much trouble.i was well under weight, but it's probably helpful to travellers to know, it goes on only one bag, not weight, which meant I couldn't check thru a smaller bag as well.<br>The plane very comfortable, service good as was the food. Would definately fly with them again."
373,Traveler830302,5,"Great experience during the trip.<br>There are no delay in onboard and fly.<br>Staff very friendly, polite, helpful and provided the good service"
373,Moomin678,3,"I usually fly budget airlines so I was excited to be travelling like a grown-up (I'm 40) but to be honest it wasn't that much better than I'm used to. Seats felt much the same, legroom much the same. Inflight entertainment, luggage and food included was a nice bonus but none of it spectacular. I have no real negative comments though so I would recommend them, I would fly with them again but I would have no hesitation in choosing another airline in pursuit of that wow experience."
373,1958Liz,4,"My husband and I were very excited to be able to fly business class as it was something we had never been able to do. We were not disappointed.The check in was easy and the  cabin staff were efficient and friendly. The service was excellent, drinks were plentiful (if needed) food was good and capsule type seat made the trip much more comfortable. Having access to the Lotus Lounge was helpful but there was a difference between services offered at each lounge. If we ever get the chance to travel overseas again, we will definitely consider Vietnam Airlines."
373,Karen W,5,"Flew economy with this airline as it was a booked tour through TripADeal and i must say I was very nervou about flying economy as I’ve been very spoilt with qantas biz class previously. Checkin in Sydney really easy and transit through HCMC was easy<br>These guys are great. Much more leg room than I expected, probably the best I’ve seen on an economy flight anywhere. I’m gluten intolerant and my friend travelling with me is allergic to fish......no dramas and the food was exceptional....on par with qantas biz class i think, only without the good chinaware!<br>Both flights ( HCMC and onto Hanoi) were equal in service and the staff were fantastic.  Would definately recommend them as a flying partner."
373,Cheryl F,5,"This is the third trip we have done with this airline and we are hooked.  We have paid the extra and flown Business Class each time as we both have problems with legs.  The service is second to none, the staff are professional and friendly, food is good, lay down seats excellent.  We find Business Class is affordable for the comfort we experience."
374,joannaeyarhono,5,"We took 2 international flights and 3 domestic flights within Vietnam over the course of 18 days.  Having not heard anything about them before I was a bit apprehensive about booking, normally use BA or Cathay Pacific, however the fact that you can get a direct flight from Heathrow was the deciding factor!<br><br>We travelled on the 787 Dreamliner, it was very comfortable and the service we received from the attendants was consistent and fault less on each flight. <br><br>I tried to pre-book extra leg room seats in advance but was unable to do so, being told to just ask when we checked in for our flights?!  Amazingly we were given these seats on every flight we took and for no additional cost - its a shame other airlines dont take this approach as it was a nice touch.<br><br>Very happy to recommend Vietnam Airlines and will definitely book again."
374,James Leow,5,"Economy flight but enjoyable,bigger cabin,snack,movies and etc. Reasonable price but do remember select order flight model A350-900 type. Cabin crews polite and helpful. Only need to take transfer buses to flight and arrive take transfer buses to arrival hall. Not an issue for me because buses were ready once flight completely stop."
374,BIGBOOTIES,5,"Just returned from Vietnam by Vietnam Airlines. We have travelled the world on many 'main line' airlines, but none can compare with the care, attention and professionalism shown by Vietnam Airlines. This trip was a first for us to Vietnam and needless to say flying an 'unknown' airline was slightly unnerving, (this from a 'victim' of excell airline.) From check in to landing, the whole experience was reassuringly wonderful. I cannot praise this airline too highly, they are professional to the highest degree, an experience we hope to repeat many times."
374,Carolyn A,4,"This Vietnam Airlines Dreamliner has the best legroom in economy class we have experienced on any aircraft we have flown on. The service, meals and entertainment were also of a good standard. However we were quite surprised to have to collect our luggage at the Ho Chi Minh international airport and re-drop it at a transit point before we made our way the domestic terminal for our next flight. However they did book it straight through to Sydney on our return flight. Would fly with them again."
374,susanneb,5,I found the flight good. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I would recommend Vietnam Airlines to my friends and family. The food was lovely and plenty of it.
375,Carol R,4,"New 787 Dreamliner has plenty of leg room even in economy, a lovely meal for lunch. Heaps of overhead baggage space, and even tall people can stand in their seating area without bumping their heads. Friendly and helpful staff assisting passengers with meals, drinks and comfort."
375,Jenny M,5,We traveled on 5 flights with Vietnam Airlines over a 3 week period. We never had a problem. The staff were helpful and friendly. The meals were very good. In flight entertainment had plenty of choices especially when flying 8 hours. All flights were on time. We will definitely be flying with Vietnam Airlines again.
375,소라 강,3,"service on the fight was nice. However, my awful experience at the check-in counter at ICN may have downgraded its quality. Even though I had arrived at the ICN airport 3 hours in advance, they did not place clear sign where to line up, nearly half of passengers who were at the front had to be replaced at the tail of a random line. <br><br>Web check-in consistently not working."
375,TraceyLea2013,3,"Unfortunately you don't have a lot of choice when travelling this route, but this flight was delayed considerably, the airport very ordinary, gate was terrible by western standards and the plane was very old.<br>The service was OK and the staff were friendly.The looked fantastic, uniform etc.<br>I received emails every couple of days for 2 months with 5 minute changes to the flight times either earlier or later, I would suggest that Vietjet did not bother saying anything until the last days before the flight.<br>The landing and Takeoff were good.<br>I would try not to use this airline again"
375,KevinTunn,4,"Two flights involved here, London to Hanoi and Hanoi to Ho Chi Min. The first leg was on a new 787 Dreamliner. Business seating was 1x2x1 so all seats had aisle access.<br>The flight was well served by excellent cabin crew. They were very attentive throughout this overnight journey with drinks and so forth available on request. The only downside, which prevents me giving five stars was twofold. First the meal selection ran out for one option by the time they got to me and I was only on row three. That is very bad in business class. Second was the IFE, most offerings were quite old and there is limited English language programmes.<br>Other than that the service was great, the seat very comfortable, it reclined to a fully flat bed.<br><br>The second leg, Hanoi to Ho Chi Min was on an old Airbus A321. That said the food was again very good and cabin crew very attentive."
376,David T,1,"After checking in 5 of our 14 party they refuse to check the rest of us because they say we can’t go to Cambodia for one day. <br><br>Even though we had confirmed that we could do this with the embassy and even though they sold us the return tickets, they refuse to allow they rest of us to check in. <br><br>After an expensive phone call to the Australian Embassy to confirm that the same day travel is OK they want to us to cancel or postpone because of the rule they print out on their computer. <br><br>We flagged!<br><br>Hoping that we may get a refund????<br><br>Please tick the helpful vote icon if I’ve helped you with this review?"
376,Marie O,5,"We had the best experience ever the whole experience was so good we are looking forward to our flight home.  Service excellent, very comfortable and from beginning to end we could not have asked for better."
376,STalapatra,5,A great connection especially if you are travelling such that you reach Yangon by evening. Finish half day work and take this connection so that you reach early evening get a good rest and start your next day with a bang... staff is polite prompt and friendly. It's a 2 hrs flight
376,Grangeon p,5,Nice welcome.Nice team. Simple and correct food.Perfect timing.good and recent plane.<br>No expensive fly tickets.
376,Navin U,4,"Good comfortable seats, new look inside. Good staff service. Departure and arrival on time. Food quality reasonable."
377,_john_kanard,5,"I was unsure about an airline I had never experienced, but Vietnam Airlines delivered, with style and smiles, and cabin service (food, wine and entertainment facilities) which not only pleased, but assured I will fly with the airline again in the future. And, if you are flying directly to Vietnam there seems little point in considering any other carrier."
377,Phil J,1,"Reasonably comfortable, definitely inexpensive but their Lotus Miles program is a nightmare. My wife and I travelled business class return, Sydney to Paris earlier this year and despite almost a dozen emails still have no points to show for it. We have given them flight details, seat numbers, passport numbers, inside leg measurements and what we chose to eat on the flight (well maybe not quite but it feels like it,) and now we’re told we will only get the points if we sent them “copies of our original boarding passes”!?! Don’t their records show them who booked and flew? Indifferent, incompetent and bordering on a scam as they promise benefits that aren’t delivered. We had intended becoming regular customers and were intending to use the points to upgrade flight to Danang at the end of the year, instead with no points and a firm commitment to not using Vietnam ever again, we’re flying to Denpasar, business with Qantas and expect to have the relevant points in our accounts within a day or two of travelling with no further action required on our part!"
377,Alex Vizcaino,5,Vietnam airlines is doing a great job they treat passangers very well from start to finish. The service is great. They provide food and beverages even in short flights. I'm very pleased that I chose them for my trips.
377,bibhurath87,5,Vietnam is colourful and the flights too.It looks like a blue 🐋.The flight attendant and staffs are great.will make you feel a pleasure trip. The seats are spacious and the food is tantalizing. Drinks are also served on the flights.<br>We had a nice trip!
377,Laurel D,5,"I can highly recommend Vietnam Air business class.It is extremely good good value, almost half the price of the big airlines. Flat bed seats, great food and wine, really excellent attentive service from the charming and beautiful flight crew. Not a huge selection of English language movies but I can always find something good to watch."
378,vivers2018,4,"Boarding was smooth, no delays, in-flight entertainment was great, choice between western or Vietnamese food and was nice, staff friendly offering beverages, though the beer needs to be chilled longer. My son is 6'4',they gave him the exit door on return flight to give him more leg room. Will use VNA  when visit Vietnam again"
378,saul g,4,"We had several flights with Vietnam Airlines ( End of September and start of October) : HKG to HAN ; HAN to REP  ; SGN  to DAD ;  DAD to HAN ;  HAN to HKG ; <br>All check-ins and flights were very good . We were notified twice , in advance , by email about a 20 minutes delay of one of the flights . Very nice . <br>Food service on board (HKG to Han and HAN to HKG) was quick and tasty , with free wine/beer/soft drinks . <br>We felt a bit sqeezed in the seats (knee room, as we are boyh over 180 cm.) but the flights were short enough so no harm done ."
378,Phuong Anh,5,"VNA has always my first choice when it comes to travelling as it's always punctual (At least for all the flights that I have booked). Their prices are quite high in comparison with other domestic airlines but it's worth every penny.<br><br>There is a tiny hiccup that their crews rarely seem to be friendly/ smiling at all during my flights but I understand that probably their flight schedules are tight and busy, which can result in tiredness."
378,mjsharp66,3,"Booked a round-trip, Business Class and was very impressed with the Check-in at SGN, unfortunately the flight portion was semi-mediocre - in-flight entertainment was not available, seat neither reclined or foot rest worked?<br>More to follow on the return trip to SGN, might get lucky and have a better seat, that actually works?"
378,sdufour,2,"I would say that our experience with Vietnam Airlines (we use the airline regularly since we live in Hanoi) is far from being satisfactory:<br><br>Bad aspects:<br><br>a)	Time to retrieve your luggage from the carousel area is excessively long due to the fact that Vietnamese use the Vietnam Airlines passenger flights like cargo flights to transport their hundreds of boxes of commercial goods, including perishable items such as bananas, apples, frozen shrimps (which indeed unfreeze during the flight), in addition to the risk, indeed, that your luggage will be, if not damaged, at the very least badly impacted by the fact that it had been placed beside a box of perishable items in the plane’s compartment area;<br>b)	Bad air pressure in the economy class;<br>c)	Impossible to do the check-in online out of Vietnam;<br>d)	Being typically woken up during the flight because the flight attendant wants you to eat;<br>e)	No respect by numerous passengers of the NO USE mobile phones when landing while flight attendants do nothing to prevent such use though they can see it;<br>f)	Excessive number of interruptions of the TV screen for reasons which, quite often, don’t seem essential, especially since it is impossible to hear what it’s said.<br>Good:<br>a)	Flights are normally on time;<br>b)	Flights attendants are nice and polite though their English is often terrible."
379,oiramsq,4,"Several friends have flown Vietnam Airlines from Shanghai to Sydney (connecting in Vietnam) and had nothing but great things to say about them.  For our family's vacation to Vietnam we took VN and were all really pleasantly surprised.  <br><br>787-8 service, new(ish) business class seats that were very comfortable.<br><br>The inflight entertainment was ""so-so"" but it was only a 2 and a half hour flight... and frankly I'm not the best judge of these things as I like to sit and watch movies with no sound on so I can make up my own storylines.<br><br>The food was EXCELLENT. <br><br>Let downs? It wasn't as cost effective as I would have liked... if I had booked earlier it would have been cheaper so that's not a ding on them - it's on me."
379,Sawa8,1,"My issue with the airline is I wanted to cancel my flight and get some sort of refund. The airline was like you can not get any refund. I’m not sure if this is standard, they kept telling me to call my agent (last minute.com). My flight was 1344 Euros which is not cheap. <br><br>I was disappointed with both ends that is my agent and the airline.<br><br>At the end I decided to cancel the flight and forget about the money.<br><br>Never again."
379,Sandra P,5,We always fly Vietnam airlines inside of Vietnam the service is reliable and we find service very good.  We have also taken Vietnam airlines from Sydney to Hanoi last year and this was a direct flight which we found very good with lovely meals.
379,Bristravelling,5,"Hands down the best airline we’ve flown for short flights within SE Asia. Although slightly delayed (10 mins) the flight was very comfortable, staff on board were extremely friendly and afternoon snack was well-enjoyed."
379,Eve04112012,5,We took two flights to and from Phu Qouc. The flight were on time and the planes were clean and the staff very helpful.
380,Anne-Charlotte H,4,"Good airline! I recommend this airline: safe, good service, recent aircraft, food on board, enough space for the legs. <br>It was perfect for a short flight!"
380,Jpog123,3,"Disappointing re service on business class  flights compared to other airlines. However they departed on time and arrived early going out and returning. Food on this flight, leaving at 0120 hrs local ,they offered us dinner.The business lounge prior to the flight, though rather spartan, had enough food to enable us to think of early breakfast rather than dinner !. A request to defer dinner was accepted and served 5 hours later after a sleep followed by breakfast 3 hours later.<br>The seats are the same set up as the 'dreamliner' on other airlines, but the greetings and service needs to sharpened and the english skills improved. (? course on Singapore Airlines required!?)<br>However this is being a bit picky but I hope it is helpful."
380,Patrice S,3,"We flew on Vietnamese airline from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi, then from Hanoi to Hoi An then from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh during our trip to Vietnam. The booking and check in went fine and planes were on time or max a few minutes delayed. The crew was friendly and professional. The planes were relatively clean (although on one flight my seat was not clean). We had to take the bus to board the planes as they were in the middle of nowhere on the airport and it was really hot.Overall for short flights across Vietnam I recommend taking them as this is one of the biggest airline in Vietnam."
380,109KarenD,4,"Vietnam Airlines is a great choice of airline when flying between Australia and Vietnam, as they fly direct to both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. <br>We traveled in Premium Economy on an overnight flight, and the seats were comfortable and the staff welcoming and attentive. <br>We received 2 meals on the 8 hour flight. Disappointingly, the breakfast wasn't very tasty and not well cooked, but it didn't ruin the flight for me. Because the seats were so comfortable, I slept for most of the flight, and didn't use the inflight entertainment. <br>I would travel Vietnam Airlines again, it was a pleasant flight."
380,808stays,4,"Because the short flight was international, we were fed a Vietnamese sandwich. Our flights were not fully booked, so we could spread out and enjoy lots of legroom. The service was friendly and efficient, and the price was good. I flew them domestic within Vietnam, and they were a pretty much on time. I'd fly this airline again, as prices are good. Planes were fine for short rides - 3 hours or less."
381,Debbie G,1,"Do not book with this airline!  We flew with them to Vietnam in September 2018.  To say it was a 12 hour flight, we had one meal at the beginning of the flight and one an hour before we landed and nothing in between!  People were having to go to the back of the plane to ask the steward's for something to eat.  This was the same with the drinks, the service was terrible.  I wanted my window blind up as it was early afternoon and I got asked to close it because people were trying to sleep - I laughed and said no way - it was the AFTERNOON!!  I think the crew just want to get you fed, shut you up and then see you again an hour before landing - terrible service!"
381,Yong Kook L,4,"I took Vietnam Air several times. Except local line or limited international<br>line (no other flight), the price seems to be good than other famous air-lines."
381,SampaiJumpaLagi,5,Booked our recent flight to Vietnam with friends through webjet and could not have been happier.  The service we received from the moment we checked in to arriving at our destination in Hanoi was second to none.<br><br>I arranged a wheelchair for my wife which they provided and transported us around with not a problem.  We were seated first on board and escorted off the plane at the other end and met with another wheelchair and escorted through customs and onto to our connecting flight.<br><br>The on board service was excellent and the staff were very attentive to our needs.  The seats were quite comfortable and there was enough leg room.  The meals were tasty and not bad also.'<br><br>Overall very happy with the service and this airline and would not hesitate to fly with them again when we return to Vietnam.
381,goldiemt,5,the aircraft they used was so smooth and refreshing it was a joy to travel we arrived after 12hrs quiet refreshed for old gits and that was all in economy the staffs pampering was there when one needed it top marks Vietnam Airways
381,NGUYỄN H,5,I often use Vietnam Airlines for our business trip not only in Vietnam but also to other countries in the world!<br>The most interesting for Vietnam Airlines is the policy to buy oversea ticket from Korea I alway get a free flight in Domestic in Vietnam^^
382,Violeta B,2,"I decided to buy a ticket from Vietnam airlines cause I thought that they would be more like European British airways/Air France or so on. Howeve, the time of my flight was changed twice and the last change was just few hours before my flight. It is rather annoying cause i booked a car to pick me from Nha TRang airport. Not very nice beginning of my trip."
382,C D,5,"Great premium economy class! Great selection of movies! Good food , great service !  Very polite efficient staff! I would highly recommend it 👍🏽"
382,fowlerkerrie,5,"From the minute we were on the plane until our arrival I felt safe, the crew were courteous and attentive, the plane very clean, food enough to keep me satisfied. Luggage promptly arrived to be picked up on arrival. Boarding our plane from Ho Chi Min City was amazing, crew managed to seat everyone swiftly, no line ups on the aircraft and I must also add the Staff at the desk for our seat allocationwhen we arrived at the airport were very friendly."
382,Hrududu,1,2 weeks before travel Vietnam Airlines rescheduled the flight I had booked. They rescheduled it to 1 day earlier. No information was provided on how I could cancel these tickets or get a refund.
382,Wayne F,5,"I recently flew with Vietnam Airlines A350 and had awesome flights both ways. My first flight to Ho Chi Min City I upgraded to Premium Economy and that was well worth it. Extra leg room and width in the seats. Nice big screen and extra touch from the air hostesses.<br>On the way back I flew in economy and had a window seat 21 K and it was comfortable, good leg room, great food and I had a great sleep home which is unusual because I am always not happy having to return home from any trip!! <br>The service at all airports with Vietnam Airlines was efficient &amp; organised.<br>I will definetly fly with Vietnam Airlines again. <br>Cheers"
383,cmbreuer2016,5,"Another great flight on Vietnam Airlines. We were advised the flight would leave 20 minutes late by text. We still were cleared on arrival at Danang Airport at about the time our friends estimated that we would collect our luggage on the original time. <br>The staff act professionally, it’s a pleasure to fly."
383,Giao Chau N,4,"In general, a good airline. However a few points of inconsistency that need to be addressed:<br><br>1) Check-in: We could not get upgraded at check-in counter in Noi Bai airport (VN) because we were told ""the reservation system is not equipped to do so at the counter""! This was surprising because the same airline was able to offer this service to us at the check-in counter at Da Nang airport (also in VN) a week earlier!!! Why the inconsistency? <br>In any case, the flight was half empty so we were able to sit where we wanted and saved our money!!<br> <br>2) Security measures: We had been flying internally with VN airlines during our trip from one city to another and never had any hassles with our electronic devices (laptop, tablets, cameras) which we always placed in our checked luggage. Helas, it was not true at Noi Bai! They marched me back into the X-ray area once we had cleared security so that I had to rummage through my checked suitcases and took all these devices out and carry them as hand luggage. The explanation was that ""it was not safe to leave them inside the suitcases in the hold"". The airline staff in all our other internal flights never requested us to do that! I then had to queue again for another 15 minutes to clear security even though these devices had already been cleared at the X-ray chamber just now! Suffice to say I was very happy and grateful for the experience, all the more at a capital city airport!  <br><br>3) In-flight service: Stewardesses looked like they had a bad day. Wish they had smiled a little more.<br><br>Taking into account the other internal flights with VN airlines during our trip, I think this was just a glitch. However, what was that saying ""One scabby sheep is enough to spoil the whole flock”?"
383,Nickdafa,4,"Before taking the flight, i reviewed a lot flight report online. When I actually took the flight, I was really taken good care by the airline which I did not expect. The domestic lounge is nice in its food and environment. Sequence of boarding was arranged nicely.<br>However, there are still space of improvement. Cabin crew's English proficiency has to be improved further though it is a domestic flight, but Da Nang is a quite well-known tourism city in Vietnam. I was told by friends that Vietnam airlines official website payment process was not working in the country of China which is such a pity. Some of my friends had no choice but divert to OTA to buy the tickets."
383,Garry P,5,"The flight was only 1hour 40 minutes,<br>But there was still a full drink and dinner service, food was good was a choose out of fish and rice or chicken noodle, I have never known a full dinner service that did not cost extra on such a short flight before, also the baggage allowance was 30kg which I thought was great, my flight with ethiad mid September to Bangkok from the uk was only 23kg, the staff were also great<br>Will fly with these again"
383,FrankandLorraine,5,Great airline. Food was excellent and customer service was great. The plane it self was reasonably modern with all the mod cons one would expect from today’s airlines.v
384,a t,3,"Headrests with resting wings.<br>Gift packs with slippers etc<br>In chair entertainment systems.<br>Hot and cold towels to refresh you.<br>Food was good.<br>They dimmed the lights after cleaning up was done; that was good.<br>The toilet was clean.<br>One issue was the chairs are close. Thankfully, we were assigned a row where there was a spare seat, so we could stretch out and sleep. <br><br>I forgot to say service is polite.<br><br>I would fly with them again, but I would choose a carrier with more seat space first."
384,Joe T,4,"Pretty standard,  not the greatest but acceptable. Comparable to low budget airline. Service was good.  Took a little while to get to terminal but it is airport not airplane"
384,bends,3,"Premirem economy seat comfortable, inflight service good, but 4 flights I took all delayed and they made passengers wait long without any announcement. both HCM and PhuQuoc airports staffs were irritatingly slow"
384,Graeme H,5,"As per previous Sydney/Hanoi review, very satisfied with our flight. Excellent cabin crew, very friendly and helpful, enjoyed the meals."
384,Graeme H,5,"First time passengers with Vietnam Airlines, flew Business Class and have no complaints at all. Excellent service from the cabin crew, enjoyable and tasty meals, crew very friendly and helpful."
385,barrymoule3,1,"*Worst airline food in 45 years travel and worst customer support in a technical issue.<br>We travelled Vietnam Airlines from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh and return.  On the outward leg we were kept waiting in departure lounge for 7 hours. The plane took off at the time it was due to land in HCMC.  Any carrier can have a technical issue but most would have a contingency plan, alternate aircraft arrangements and would keep customers informed of the issue and its resolution.  All we were told was that we would get another update in an hour or so.  This continued all day . By way of consolation we received two $14 food vouchers.<br>In flight food in both directions was barely eddible.  Hard leathery pork on two flights (too hard to cut or chew) and for breakfast scrambled eggs like a rubber ball.  I stood my cutlery up in the egg to the astonishment of the flight attendant . Her reaction was a quick ""sorry"" and departure.<br>Also, on the return leg one seat back (21A) would not fix into position (either upright or layback). My wife felt unsafe during turbulance.  We reported the matter to flight attendant but there was no resolution or feedback.  As a secondary issue, the inflight entertainment (movies etc.) was limited and dissapointing by comparison with other airlines.<br>Overall we felt, having experienced wonderful food and hospitality in Vietnam, that the airline did not in any way reflect Vietnam's cultural values.  If, as stated by the airline their core philosophy is to increase Vietnam's profile, then they need to significantly raise their standards. As it stands I would in future select a flight via Singapore or HK with another carrier rather than go direct with Vn ."
385,Jodene,4,"Quick, easy checkin, bigger seats than all other airlines i’ve flown with, good professional service. Have flown with them twice while on holiday with my family, would recommend esp for the price."
385,Ngoc N,4,"It's a good airlines but expensive if you compare the price and service with others. I often fly between saigon and hanoi with this one(10 years). And sometime flied oversea. Good service, comfortable seat, nice crew, but expensive ticket. 25kg luggague and food, drinking are always already including with price. Maybe that's the reason you pay more than other airlines. If you only fly between cities, provinces of VietNam, you should book this airlines. Because it's quite, clean, fast, boarding on time."
385,Shirley Blomeley,5,While on tour in Vietnam  l had three internal flights best and easiest way to travell around . It dose take a bit of time going to airport and waiting for the plane but you are only in the plane for about an hour.Then you are at your new destination.  I am not sure of cost because this was in my tour cost.  Happy traveler    Shirley Blomeley
385,serenityGymea,4,"On Our recent trip to Europe we again used  Vietnam Airlines Business Class travelling 4 sectors . The price point and value for business class is excellent despite only being rated 4 star airline.<br>Since 2017 staff attentiveness and anticipating customers need has vastly improved as well as spoken and understood English! The team provided excellent service on all 4 sectors we travelled with each sector between 9 -11 hours long!<br>The meals have been refreshed as I believe you have engaged the services of Luke Nygen! <br>They were good quality and delicious and well presented in your lovely china! <br><br>HOWEVER the wine list is tired and boring ! The white wine and champagne selection has not changed in 2 years! I believe it’s even longer!<br><br>Come on Mr or Ms Sommelier you can do better and refresh the wine list to compliment your new and refreshed meals .<br><br>A suggestion would be adding some wines from the regions of travel !For example  Some Australian, some German etc.<br>You have Saki on Japan sector so what about doing the same and mixing in some new wine ideas! <br><br>Look forward to testing the new wine selection  in 2019😊"
386,LJH37,4,Flew from Melb to Hanoi via Saigon and from Hanoi to Hue. 30kg luggage allowance. You can take the 30kg domestically as well if you book all of your flights on the same ticket as the international flight. It's a basic airline but we haven't had any issues. So far 3 of our 4 flight times have changed but the 2 flights we have had left on time. The flight from Melbourne is a day flight. The return flight is over night.
386,Pete T,5,We have flown twice now with Vietnam Airlines to Ho chi min with connecting flights to Hanoi and also Hoi an.We have not experienced any issues as all staff at all airports have been extremely helpful when we were unsure of anything.Happy to recommend using Vietnam Airlines and will be using them again.Congratulations to them on all aspects of their service.
386,AvidWchrTraveller,5,"A great airline to fly with terrific, friendly, attentive staff. A good airline to fly to destinations in Asia as well as onward to Europe, with a stop-over in Vietnam. Connecting flights with this airline to onward destinations have always been good for me. Aisle chairs are available for those with mobility issues to get between your seat and the restroom as well as between the aircraft door and your seat allocation."
386,Chris S,5,"As far as short haul flights go the service was great, the seats were adequate and food was good enough. Can't really ask for more on a short haul flights IMO. With that said,<br>I have used them for a longer haul flights and find their business class superb."
386,Austin K,5,"Excellent service and care. The seat/bed is very comfortable. I flnd flying intimidating at the best of times, however the diligent staff from the booking in counter to the flight staff is tranquilizing. Couldn't ask for more."
387,Sue M,4,The planes are new and clean.. The staff warm and friendly. the food was like all airline food average.
387,HGC_13,5,We were a bit worried about flying on Vietnam airlines but we were surprised how good the flight was was. We had a very comfortable and excellent flight. The staff was professional and very helpful. Good leg space in the economy class and the flight service was excellent.
387,Graham H,3,We flew to Vietnam from Sydney  aboard the787 Dreamliner in economy I thought it would be more spacious being the new plane but the seats are still cramped for a 6 foot er and 3 abreast is too close for an 8 hour flight the inflight service was good and meals ok although cold drinks would be good as would be hot tea &amp; coffee plenty of movies to watch but hard to hear above the engines it was ok but I don't think I should pay double to get room to sleep -- I expected better I won't be going through that torture again
387,leisakirk,5,I found the aircraft very comfortable with lots of leg room and comfy seats. It seemed very spacious and quieter than other flights l’ve taken. The staff at the airport were very efficient directing us on to connecting flights and made the whole traveling experience a lot easier and less stressful. I highly recommend Vietnam Airlines.
387,thanh t,5,"Very friendly staff, good service on board. They served amazing dinner and breakfast with Vietnamese and European options. I will definitely recommend this airline."
388,Kiwicyclo,4,Paid for forward seating with extra bag and a meal. Looks like plane was swapped out for a smaller A321 than the scheduled 787 just prior to boarding. Selected seats not recognised stuck way down the back of the plane and everyone got a meal. <br><br>Bussed to and from the aircraft which was strange at Hanoi as every air bridge was vacant. <br><br>Aircraft was clean and tidy. Crew were great. Other travelling passengers very pushy and shovy
388,Jo N,5,"This is a great airline, we have used them to fly to Vietnam 12 times now and have only had one major delay and they put us in a hotel overnight and supplied dinner. The staff are very helpful and eager to please. Our last trip was business class and they have flat beds, this was a luxury for us."
388,woopie111,4,"Only two options for a direct flight btwn HCM and Sydney. This is the better one. <br><br>Business class in the new 787 is excellent, great seats, good service okay entertainment system. <br><br>Flight on time and well managed. <br><br>Only gripe would be in row 5 I couldn’t have my choice for any of the meals. All my selection had been taken by people seated ahead of me. What I was offered was good for what it was. QWine list is reasonable. <br><br>Also bags marked with “Priority” and “Business Class” seemingly get no priority at all. Mine was almost last. Annoying."
388,_ntwali,5,Second experience with this Airline on both occasions found the quality of service up their with the best in Asia staff very polite and attentive.Aircraft clean and tidy.
388,NatBan70,4,I recently flew premium economy from Sydney to Saigon - it was FANTASTIC - the service was amazing - the seats are really comfortable and the little extra's you get definitely are worth the extra money.  The seats don't fully recline but they recline enough for you to have a good sleep and the amount of leg room is amazing.  The only downside is that the in-flight entertainment is not as extensive as other airlines but you should be able to find something to watch and while away the hours.
389,sal C,3,"Overall no different to what all the airlines are now doing to economy class travellers, bums on seats , the more you can squash in the back ,the more leg room you can offer at the front end. These planes are so packed you, theres hardly a spare seat. If you have a window seat, its almost impossible to get up to stretch your poor twisted body when you want to! I ached everywhere when I got off these flights. The service was good though and the food was good but so happy to get off."
389,gahughes1,4,Vietnam air flight from Melbourne was a top flight. Quiet and service in a new aircraft. Would highly recommend. Service was top class and the cabin experience a real surprise.
389,Marco Pan,5,I was surprised of the kindness of the staff working around this company. They were really friendly during all the flights and even on the ground service. Actually I got once some problem before embarking and they helped me in such a way I was really surprised and only thank to the personal I could continue my journey in the best way. I'll never forget it!
389,Travplane,3,"Economy Class is a 3, 3, 3 configuration. I am a small person and my elbows rubbed on the sides of the seat. Also when using the in flight entertainment system because the seat controller is in the top of the arm rest when ever I put my arm on the arm rest the programme would change in some unexpected way. Finally when the seat reclined it would return to the upright position over a 1 hour period requiring you to recline the seat again."
389,Hanh Van Pham,5,"I have never had to complain anything about services of Vietnam Airlines, and my last flight from London to Hanoi was not an exception. Food was delicious and plenty to eat. Sandwich and noodles are available for free at anytime during the flight! How amazing. Legroom was large enough, flight was very smooth on a B787-9 Dreamliner, Entertainment was exciting. Just a small room for improvement: The breakfast should be served earlier, 90mins before arrival sounds a little bit lack of time.<br><br>Strongly recommend this and will always fly with Vietnam Airlines in the future"
390,penelopepickstop,4,"We flew premium economy . Good experience, pleasant friendly staff. Food  good as far as airline food is concerned"
390,Lg45now,5,Check in painless and I was transit to Sydney. Food was tasty good seat behind exit row with extra leg room.
390,Lg45now,5,Very impressed. Flight and seats fine check in good. The female flight crew were surly which was a same.
390,Alvin_Phey,4,"We took the Vietnam Airlines from KUL to FUK (Fukuoka), with a stop over at Hanoi. The layover is almost 4 hours but the airlines was smart enough to keep it at below 4 hours to avoid paying perks to the connecting passengers. This is our 3rd times taking such flights to Japan (but connecting to different cities in Japan). The quality of flight was satisfied, quality of onboard meal was definitely better on the route from Hanoi to Japan. The only recommendation we hope for the airlines to improve is to allow the online check in to be earlier at 48 or 72 hours before the scheduled time so that it’s more convenient to the passengers. Currently it’s at 24 hours before the scheduled time."
390,Tom9078,4,"I was very dubious of flying on Vietnam air.  However my worries were for naught.  Plane was well run and I saw nothing ""off""  Aircraft was a Boeing; I was worried that Vietnam airways would be using some type of Russian, Chinese or North Korean built equipment."
391,626frank,3,"Just back from Vietnam which included two long haul flights from and back too London,<br>Great new wide bodied planes but really dissapointed with service,on way out a meal was served quite quickly the the shades were put down at 4pm and nothing further to eat for 11Hours! <br>Just not enough attention from plane staff,when the Pilot put on the seat belt sign during the flight they never checked that everyone had followed the instruction,while greeting a drink was hard work,also being told that the gin had run out.<br>On the return from Hanoi an early dinner then again nothing for 11 Hours and then the advertised scrambled egg had run out and sticky rice was offered instead, Lovely people but they need to be more on the ball and more professional,the announcements very hard to hear and not enough infomation from the Captain. Hopefully they will improve but not on a par with other Airline service ."
391,wayneandcath8,5,"A huge thank you to Vietnam Airlines for our two recent domestic flights. For prompt, simple and efficient transfer between cities they were ideal. Helpful staff, prompt baggage handling and excellent prices 🙌🙌"
391,Rui C,5,"We did a short flight from Hanói to Hue on September '18. Did the check in online, dropped off luggage in 10min. Ok the planes aren't new or fancy, but they left and arrived on time, got luggage realy fast. Nothing to complain about, would book again."
391,LazenayD,5,"Recently had a flight from Hcm to Hanoi for business purpose. Flight was on-time, which I guess should be normal. Plane was huge for in Vietnam flight, service was good, dinner was served and I was able to watch movie which is unusual to find for just 1 hour 45 flight. Will keep using VA."
391,david b,5,This was my 1st time traveling on Vietnam airlines and I was quite impressed. We flew economy and found that the leg room in a normal seat was very good for an airbus a 350-900. The food and entertainment for a full service flight was also very good. All flight staff on the ground and in the air were fantastic. All correspondence and check in procedures were swift and easy.
392,Robert,4,"We have taken three internal flights in Vietnam, all with Vietnam Airlines (or its subsidiary) and found each to be quite good. We felt quite safe and, whilst a couple of flights were delayed a half hour, they were otherwise reliable re ticketing (online from Australia), luggage, etc., and at a very good price. Don't expect in-flight service, though, beyond a moist towelette and bottle of water."
392,Lynleyfish,4,"After reading reviews of VietJet and Jetstar serving this route, I decided to take Vietnam Airlines due to the reliability of on-time performance, according to other reviewers. It paid off. Everyone we talkd to in Vietnam told us that Vietnam Airlines is the best.<br>Check-in for this flight was easy, and we ended up in the exit row with heaps of legroom, which was great for my tall husband.  <br>The flight attendants were very attentive to the safety issues on board the aircraft, something we expect to see all the time in NZ.  So it was nice to see another airline being so safety-conscious. It was nice to get a ""refreshing tissue"" once seated, something much appreciated in the hot Vietnamese climate.  Once in the air, the cabin temperature dropped nicely.  <br>No problem with bag collection at our destination. <br>Although more expensive than the other airlines on offer for this route, it was worth it for flight reliability and comfort.<br>Will use this airline again if ever in Vietnam."
392,ClanFraserTravels,2,We flew with this airline from Da Nang to Saigon on our recent tour of Vietnam. <br>Check in and security screening were slightly problematic . We were charged excess baggage on exactly the same weight as we arrived into the country which was free of charge on our departure from Laos. We were instructed to go to another desk on the other side of the terminal to pay the charge which annoyed us slightly. ( a little inefficient!!!) we felt that we had been ripped off slightly which left a bad taste to what had been a wonderful trip up to that point. <br>The wait for boarding was slightly uncomfortable due to the seating provided. <br>Boarding the aircraft was something like a herd of cattle with slightly annoying passengers of Vietnamese extraction trying to barge ahead of the line. <br>The flight was full and there seemed to be little discipline in taking the correct seating or using the correct overhead lockers . The cabin staff seemed reluctant to take charge and sort out this melee.<br>During the flight there was a reoccurring bad smell of fish which I suspect was coming from a package in one of the overhead lockers. The flight was cramped and the cabin staff were not very friendly at all. Our on board meal consisted of a glass of coke and a strange bun thing. There was no other choice offered. <br>Disembarkation was the same debacle as boarding with little or no control being exercised by the cabin staff. <br>Signage to the baggage reclaim area was non excistant and we had to ask the ground staff where it was that we had to go. <br>The only good thing about this flight was the fact that it left and arrived at the correct time and that our baggage arrived at the same time as we did. I guess the fact we landed safely was also a bonus. <br>I would not recommend this airline to anybody and will not be seeking to use it again in the future.
392,KevinTunn,4,"Service onboard was excellent and the food offerings tasty and well presented, only downside being that they ran out of my first choice and I was only on row 3!<br><br>Comfortable flat bed seating in 1x2x1 configuration. Reasonable storage space for small items and large overhead for hand luggage.<br><br>IFE system quick to load but very limited choice of Western movies or TV."
392,evania23,5,"Very recommended airlines.<br>The meals was very good, similar with SQ<br>Good service. No delay. All ontime<br>I use VN for several times<br>From cgk to sgn to dad.<br>From dad to han<br>From hph to sgn<br>And sgn back to cgk..<br>Long leg eventhough i Seat on economy class.<br>The configuration that i get for all flights is 3 3<br>Thank you VN"
393,evania23,5,"This is my first time to visit vietnam.<br>Actually i go to some cities in vietnam, i fly several times with vietnam airlines.<br>Really recommended and comfort.<br>The configuration seat that i get in all flights is 3-3<br>Eventhough seat in economy class, i feel very comfort with this airlines.<br>No delay.<br>All on time.<br>And surprisingly the landing was very smooth.<br>Wow amazing!!<br>I go from cgk to sgn to dad .<br>From dad to han<br>From hph to sgn<br>And back again fron sgn to cgk.<br>The meals was very delicious. Similar with SQ.<br>Good meals.<br>Thank you VN."
393,simon b,5,My wife and I have recently returned from a guided tour to Vietnam and Cambodia with Riviera holidays in Burton on Trent who were fantastic and we would recommend to anyone. We flew with Vietnam Airlines to our destination Hanoi and also with them on the return trip from Saigon and also 5 internal flights whilst we were way. The  standard of service was excellent throughout - new planes and very efficient staff.
393,Marg Liddicoat,2,"Flying to Hanoi from Melbourne then back from Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne all meals were pretty original for westerners so bad didn't eat anything on the way home only the fruit, thats saying something when my husband will normally eat anything.  Would recommend? Staff were very good but not the food"
393,Michelle1066994,4,"I have flown With Vietnam several times and find the on board service highly professional. The flat bed is comfortable but not as good as Singapore. A request to adjust the cabin temperature was addressed quickly. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Movie offerings are the same on each leg so save some for connecting  flights. <br>The downside of this airline is the substandard Lotus Lounge at Ho Chi Min. The food is terrible, the drinks in the fridge are warm and the facilities minimal. It is not up to the standard of either the Hanoi or Frankfurt lounges. Avoid lengthy times between connecting flights is my advice."
393,Khanh H,3,Check in so fast.<br>Big plane<br>The plane so clean.<br>Staff friendly<br>The fly is on time.<br>I'm satisfied.<br>I'll choose Vietnam Airlines again.<br>Thank you !
394,Detroit,2,Dirty and completely worn out seat cushions in a 787.<br>Lousy on-board service and half of the food offerings not available anymore<br>Deserts missing almost twice completely or were completely replaced by 4 lycees.
394,Adrian M,5,"Fantastic value for money on business class throughout south East Asia. The staff are superb, the food is excellent even for short haul. <br><br>It's hard to imagine they have the same skytrax rating as BA, VN could show BA a clean pair of heels"
394,Ch-Antony,4,"The service were very good inflight  from Frankfurt to Saigon, and better than before .<br>Staffs were very attentifs for servives. Exception , Time Boarding by Vietnam Airlines must be reorganise, always mix from Business and class eco."
394,J M,5,"Recently in July I travelled on Vietnam airlines and have to commend the staff for their absolutely amazing service.  I was unwell along the way, drifting in and out of consciousness.  They made me comfortable and the whole time there was a staff member looking after me.  i improved a little and they rearranged the seating so I could be more comfortable.  They were all so attentive and helpful.  I thoroughly appreciate what they all did for me.  I have flown Vietnam Airlines yearly for the past 5 years and their service has always been great but this time it was above and beyond."
394,Scott G,4,"This was our second flight on Vietnam Air and I have to say we have been pleased. Newer aircraft, on time arrival and most importantly- no lost luggage! The staff were cordial but don’t speak much English. Check in was easy and they accommodated my seat assignment both times. And the flights were reasonably priced as well. All in all, 2 thumbs up!"
395,Alchemy,4,"We had an enjoyable and comfortable flight from Sydney to Hanoi. The service was good but not great or to expectations. The inflight entertainment was quite good with enough selection to while away the time. The food was quite nice however I was very dissatisfied with the lack of supply as I was told that my selection wasn’t available as they had none left and would I choose something else, which I begrudgingly did , only for the lady behind me to order the same thing I wanted , and low and behold they had one! Wtf! Albeit a 4 star service apparently but if you pay for a business class service, you expect better than this. Another thing was the lack of service between meals, everyone seemed to disappear to the galley. We were provided a small bottle of water and I like to drink plenty of water on flights so got up to ask for some more only to be told they had none left, so the steward poured me some out of his bottle! The other thing was that there were no snacks offered during the flight between meals either which I find very lacking as well. Overall I felt like this didn’t come close to what business class should be."
395,Marina P,5,"The plane seats were comfortable and the staff was  very nice. <br>They provided all kind of amenities, like sleeping mask and slippers, blanket, and some other things like toothbrush and toothpaste."
395,Vun Yew,4,"This is the 2nd time we choose Vietnam Airline, A321, transit in Hanoi to Nagoya.  service is good, staff are friendly , comfortable seat and good choice of meal , i love the Unagi meal and milk when we are flying back from Nagoya to Kuala Lumpur. It will be perfect if the aircraft A321 come with individual in-flight entertainment. <br>Sure will choose Vietnam Airline again in future."
395,Nicola R,4,Booked due the great price for their premium economy and was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic service.  Would definitely recommend.
395,Roslyn C,5,"My husband damaged his knee on holiday,as soon as the staff saw his knee brace they called him out of the cue ,got a wheelchair,took him straight to the counter, got him on the plain first &amp; the change over at Ho chi min city ,the took him off with a fork lift,drove him to the international airport &amp; made sure that our luggage went straight through to connecting flight. They also helped us at Sydney airport getting of the plain &amp; through customs so I didn't have to wheel him &amp; the luggage. There is lots of leg room on the seats &amp; although the food wasn't what I like ,it was hot &amp; fresh."
396,abdulsgp,3,"the only things that Halal food are less attractive other then that very thing is perfect,<br>took this airlines many times to fly to Vietnam, compare to other domestic flight in Vietnam, Vietnam airlines is more better."
396,ChiroJohn1951,5,"3 flights in one day.  Checked in with VA at Danang.  Ground service knew, without me telling them, that I had an international connection out of HCMC.  She tagged my bag 'Business'.  On entering the HCMC domestic terminal, there was a ground service lady with my name on a board.  After introducing myself she told me to go to carousel one, collect my bag, and return to her.  My bag was first off!  On returning to the lady she said 'follow me'.  I did.  She walked me from domestic to the exact line (in international) that I had to stand in to connect with Manila, via Phili[[ines Airlines.  I was very impressed.  It was a short flight so leg room and food/beverage were not a priority for me."
396,Phi N,4,"Check was good, as flight was not full. Only issue is with TSN airport immigration line being too long, and not fully staffed. This wastes a lot of time waiting versus possibly shopping or dining. These long lines hurt the airport vendors."
396,KLinh,3,"We traveled from Sydney to Paris via VN in July. From Sydney to Paris was ok , no issue. From Paris to HCM City the flight was delayed for around 1 hrs so instead of boarding @ 1.30 it was 2.30pm. We have been served late lunch and then no dinner until the next day when we arrived in HCM City.<br>It was so bad, especially for my diabetic mother-in-law.<br>I cannot believe it, especially we pay full price and not a discount/special season tickets.<br>So disappointed with  VN Airlines."
396,Michael W,4,"We flew Business class from Sydney to Hanoi then Hanoi to Heathrow return. This airline is great, we have flown with them a few times before. The plane is the newish Dreamliner. Staff on board are very good, food is good and entertainment is good. Only suggestion I have in maybe provide a mattress for the flat bed, it can be a little firm and some cushioning would be absolutely fantastic."
397,Helen M,4,Short trip but quite comfortable economy and on time.  We then travelled from Nha Trang to Da Nang and back to Ho Chi Minh City with upgrades to Business class. Service and comfort was well worth the little extra cost.  Would recommend.
397,KhanhLe89,5,Good flight and good service.<br>Nice staff.<br>It is one of the best choice for you to choose.<br>I will choose Vietnamairline next time.
397,yvonneysl,5,"Excellent flight and great service from great cabin crew. Delay at airport, but due to the typhoon the day before."
397,Keziah G,5,"It’s was only a 3 and half hour flight but they were really welcoming and hospitable. I got 2 meals coming and going; wine, tea\coffee, soda etc was offered. They also gave out blankets. I really enjoyed my flight with Vietnam airlines"
397,Dominic F,3,We chose this airline because their price was good. The food was really good which is a good compliment as the person I was travelling with does not usually like plane food. The 12 hours seemed to drag. Personally I liked the (small) range of films they had on offer and the screens were very big. You also got a usb charger which is a life saver for those with devices. Overall an okay airline and you should give it a try if you are on a budget as they still are good.
398,Ginny S,5,"Pleasantly surprised. Unfortunate weather held us up over Ho Chi Minh, however, as all other flights were also held up, connections (though late) were fine. Basic but comfortable (economy) seats and pretty good film selection and good staff.  No problem."
398,dunmowpeddler,4,"In August we flew transatlantic twice with VA, plus 3x internal flights. We found the aircraft to be very new, the staff friendly and the punctuality and check-in procedure some of the best we have experienced anywhere. The only thing that spoiled the flights was people in front reclining their seats as ever! <br>Food was quite acceptable long haul. <br>The only other negative point was the seat cushions on the Boeing Dreamliner which felt too thin and the only way I could get a comfortable position was to put the head pillow behind the small of my back. However, the flights passed quite quickly and I was able to sleep on the return to London, which is unusual for me."
398,sthradher v,5,"This was a great flight, I always enjoy flying, when I travel I don't assume I am the only one on the plane I give my self-plenty of time and days in case of unforeseen circumstances. This way I enjoy my flight and holiday. Vietnam airlines have great seats comfortable and heaps of leg room. A good entertainment system, with a variety of options. The airline has the greatest staff all very proficient in what they do the service is excellent and the choice of food and drink is exceptional I highly recommend Vietnam airlines."
398,maureen,5,Fantastic Airline .Everything ran like clockwork from check in to great food and service there was plenty of leg room plus all the other things you get from a full service airline.we did a few internal flights with them as well and also no problems would definitely fly with them again.
398,Mike C,4,"Booked with Vietnam Airlines as they were the only direct option from UK to Vietnam . Paid a bit extra for premium economy and well worth it. Big comfortable seat with loads of legroom. Good service and good food, could have been a bit more generous with the Gin and Tonics! but other than that was very impressed and would definitely fly with them again."
399,H4410RVdavidp,1,"Having Pre-Booked and paid for PE because of my long legs we arrived at Heathrow to be told that the plane had changed and that those who had booked in as PE passengers before us had been upgraded to Business Class but, as there were no more BC seats available, we would have to travel Economy. We were well on time and in no way were we late. Whilst we got a refund it totally spoilt the holiday.<br>We returned on PE but even then we were wedged into middle seats whilst others who had the benefit of a BC upgrade on the way out had window seats. <br>We will never fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
399,amrfh,5,"Travelling with Vietnam Airlines was a great experience.  The plane was clean.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Even though we were in Economy it was comfortable and we were given a rug, slippers and a vanity pack.  I would definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
399,rockapette,4,"Comfortable and clean. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Plane ran to schedule, and we felt safe"
399,Snarey,4,Pretty classy airline. Very attentive airline staff. Food was really good. My only trouble was that I am very tall and found the seats a bit squashy!!!
399,sandra_j_leong,5,"Good service from airport ground staff, they checked our luggage thru to Auckland and gave us our boarding passes for our Qantas flight from Sydney.  Easy boarding and great on board service.  Food was not brilliant but ok, inflight amenities (slippers etc) are a nice touch as was the bottle of water supplied before cabin was darkened for sleep. This was the 4th flight we had with this airline in 10 days, and we would be happy to fly with them again, especially if they flew from NZ."
400,Azizalkhoori,4,Very nice and clean fleet<br>Staff are kind <br>On time flights <br>Nice seat and big space <br>Friendly cabin crew <br><br>Recommended
400,Z919XMbernardd,5,"I am a QANTAS flyer in Australia but they have pretty terrible options for getting to Vietnam. I have been travelling to Vietnam for work and so have been here several times in the last year - and more to come. Not surprising that Vietnam Airlines is the best airline fro travel to and in Vietnam. I've found them to be relaxed, attentive and generally a good airline to fly with (I am a Platinum flyer with QANTAS and am used to being looked after by them). I don't get that level of attention with VA but they treat me well and have many flight options and their costs are very reasonable."
400,Varnie15,5,"Was a great flight,the staff were very efficient and polite. The food was great more than I expected. Nothing seemed to be a concern for the staff,anytime you wanted another drink it was there.The emu choice was very good.The beds were comfortable the entertainment was also very good.<br>The plane was clean and the toilets were regularly maintained.<br>I will fly with them again.Their price for Business Class is competitive.<br>Their Sydney Sky lounge was good but the one in Hanoi was not up to the same standard, that would be the only criticism I could make.<br>Legroom good<br>Seat Comfort good<br>Inflight entertainment good<br>Customer Service Great<br>Value Great<br>Cleanliness GreatCheckin etc Great<br>Food Drink Great"
400,chandon franck,5,The business class is really top. Crews are so kind and smiling.  Meals and drinks very good qualitty. If you want eat later no problem. Crews ear you and do the best for your satisfaction. Airbus A350 very confortable and large seat for sleep.<br><br>Hightly récommended
400,DrBretto,2,"I've flown several times with Vietnam Airlines. They have lots of flights within Vietnam and across SE Asia.<br><br>My experiences have been inconsistent. From very good to very bad. The worst time was when I had checked my bag in and my bicycle (in a large bag). A supervisor came over just as I was about to leave and said ""US$100 bicycle fee"". That is about as much as the ticket.  I said ""Really? That hasn't happened before"". I said ""Where on your web-page or ticket does it say this?"". She said ""It is in the rules"" and pulled out a book of rules. I said ""Please. I have travelled 7 times with you before with my bicycle and no fee"" [completely true] to which she said ""I will deduct the unpaid fees from the salary of the staff"". Blackmail! She asked for my passport, possibly to check the dates I had flown with them. After saying that I would not be assisting them in identifying the staff that hadn't charged the fee I said ""But you've already taken my bike. Please give it back and I will fly VietJet"" to which they said ""No. You cannot get the bicycle back.  Your only option is to pay the fee"". Of course I paid. The staff said not to be concerned; the supervisor is not a nice person.  I made a note of her ID and made a complaint to Vietnam Airlines but of course they said they would investigate and I never heard from them again. <br><br>I fly VietJet wherever possible. On the one or two occasions I've flown with Vietnam Airlines, I have never been asked to pay a fee for my bicycle.<br><br>I love Vietnam. Toi thich Vietnam lam. Vietnam Airlines I don't like."
401,Destination Review by Daniel,5,"This is the best airlines in Vietnam that you could rely on, in term of price, service, facilities. Other airlines may quote you a good price, however you have to pay for luggage, seat...More than this, flight delay of other airlines definitely make you mad."
401,Rosie B,4,"We flew with Vietnam airlines for both directions to and from Vietnam and we had no problems with either flight. For a long haul flight it was relatively comfortable, we were given pillows and blankets and great selection section of on board entertainment. Good food and drink- noodles for snacks. Toilets were well equipped also. I would recommend this airline to other people. Thank you"
401,raandaka,4,"We were pleasantly surprised with the airline standards and the efficiency of the ground staff and the information they provided to us at check-ins.  Flight attendants were very courteous.  Our preferred meal selection was no longer available by the time we were served, (seated toward the back of the plane), but the alternative meal was very nice.  No complaints whatsoever.  It is always unfortunate to have small, boisterous children seated in proximity, but that is no fault of the airline and the flight attendants did their best to try settle situations."
401,Peter Flockhart,4,"Very clean and comfortable seating with sufficient leg room for this short flight of less than 1 hour, As with most flights these days, helpful staff at check-in and through out the journey. Clear signage at both Airports."
401,Julie O,3,"We travelled to Vietnam on Vietnamese airlines in August, the plane wasn’t full so we did get a choice of seats. The only criticism I have is that I thought the customer service from the cabin staff needed a bit of fine tuning. They didn’t seem at all approachable and if you asked them for anything you felt like you were being a nuisance. I have travelled on many airlines throughout the world and unfortunately found Vietnam airlines staff to be the most miserable I have encountered."
402,Mary F,5,"The airline was a Dreamliner, felt brand new. Good legroom, good food and service. The flight crew were attentive and polite. A feeling of spaciousness and fresh air throughout the flight and loved the big windows and the self regulating lighting."
402,mikr72,4,"Traveled to Seoul via HCMC, great seat size and legroom. Good food with friendly and attentive staff."
402,ozzie-rick,4,Vietnam Airlines flight direct from melbourne to Ho Chi Minh city on a Dreamliner. Able assistance with interconnecting flight. Highly recommended.
402,lost2,5,"I must say I was initially a little concerned about flying Vietnam airlines.  Unusually I had not done a lot of research about this trip but had instead left it in the hands of our commercial tour operator.  We were pleasantly surprised, comfortable, clean, confident.  Food was average but I am yet to eat in economy on any airline and find the food anything more than average.  We had 8 flights with them in 16 days and not one problem. We found them to be equal to any major airline we have ever traveled with."
402,Alex D,5,The aircraft is new and clean. The flight attendants were very polite and charming. They served food even on a short flight. The flight left 15 minutes early. Luggage delivery was fast
403,Alex,5,"We got Vietjet air tickets for 4 persons and they changed 3 times make us very confused with our plan. Lastly, I cannot wait and decided to book VN airline. First time flied with this flight and it was so good. Professional performance guiding from the front screen and easy to understand by languages.<br>I will use the national airline in future ."
403,Jesse S,5,Absolutely amazed for a little airline that we took from Bangkok..<br>   we also used it to go from Hanoi to China and back we were highly impressed I would recommend this airline to anybody the service was phenomenal it's like any other plane as far as the room goes there's not a super lot of room but it's not as bad as any other so it's okay...<br>    furthermore the food and the service is fabulous I can't say enough good about this little Airline I was very impressed I would highly recommend it and I will use them again... furthermore I have pictures but TripAdvisor just popped up and asked me for some reason about this so I decided to answer it but pic are off phone now..
403,SSS,4,Price includes on checked bag and you also get meal service and drinks during flight. That in itself makes it a better deal than most low-budget carriers.
403,lynp58,5,Great airline. Good service on the air and on the ground. We missed our connecting flight on arrival to Hanoi. Staff were waiting for us at checkin to take us to our domestic flight which they had already transferred us too. 😎 can highly recommend
403,Thorsten F,5,"Perfect seats, very good service and huge entertainment program. Good food choices and very tasty food."
404,Boratri,5,We travelled in August in economy class. At the airport we attempted to upgrade to Premium economy but told that we had to do that on line through another independent site. Despite our disappointment we felt that the seats were very comfortable offering more legroom than most of the major airlines. Food was acceptable though unmemorable but the wines were French and very acceptable. <br>For the return journey we upgraded ourselves to business class because it was an overnight flight. The food and drinks were of a high quality (French champagne) and we had a flat bed which was the main reason for our upgrade. The toiletry kit wasn’t up to the major airlines but so what ? After a delicious dinner and a few drinks we tucked ourselves in and slept undisturbed until we were woken for breakfast. Very good value.
404,pammac8,5,"We found the airline to be good, food was very good with choices and the wine/drinks served very good.<br>The leg room on the planes was very good seemed to be better than some other flights we have done.  The bathrooms seemed to be kept quiet fresh and clean although some people are just so lazy and careless.  <br>We found that nearly all our flights where on time, one delayed which was great as we needed the extra time to connect from international airport to the domestic airport for internal flight.<br>Liked the fresh wet towels that they handed out also the flight pack with slippers etc. dry good for economy <br>We would not hesitate to use Bieynam Airlines again."
404,David W,5,I have travelled all over the world for many years of all business and for pleasure.  This is the first time I have flown with this airline I was also travelling with someone that needed special assistance I have never had such good and pleasant service as with Vietnam airlines
404,John and Margaret S,5,"Premium economy is the way to go.  Plenty of legroom, easy to have a reasonable sleep.  Very comfortable."
404,WorldCultureFan,4,"The airline has great people, but we were unable get through immigration in less than 3 hours. We ran to the domestic terminal and told the security line guard that we were going to miss our flight. He flagged dow a VietNam Airlines employee who took us to a closed counter, checked us in and then ran us through a priority security check and onto the gate, where the plane had waited for us! They checked our luggage at the door of the plane and minutes later we were on the runway."
405,lisawhite2016,3,It’s worth using this airline as government owned and reliable for flights in time when booking in things do take longer than they Gould need to have more checking open but all round all fine and service good
405,Peter S,5,I recently flew Vietnam Airlines to domestic locations within Vietnam.  Very smooth checking and great cabin service.  Highly recommend this airline...lovely cabin crew. Ground staff also extremely helpful.
405,VSP_Management,5,"Nothing to complain, it was a comfortable flight with pleasant attendants. Everything from boarding to disembarking went very well."
405,John T,5,For the price it was worth it. Booked premium economy and used optiontown to upgrade. Great service from check in to lounge and flight. Flight service was brilliant and crew so polite and not fussed with things I wanted. Good sleep in flat bed but a mattress would be ideal. Never less it was comfortable.
405,Simon R,2,"Vietnam airlines was comfortable and punctual however they lost my suitcase and that was a nightmare!! The communication was appalling. During the week we were there every time I asked them if they had found my suitcase they asked me to describe it again.<br>Eventually after giving up hope I spoke to someone in the UK office who said they had not tagged the case in chek in, and the case was still sitting in Heathrow."
406,998tamark,5,After we have the flight and wait for takeoff. There was a technical issue on the plane so שירדנו plane and we must flight later. The company concern all passengers meal at the restaurant on their own expense to flight. The service of the staff was very good
406,ianrogers53,5,"I have flown Vietnam Airline many times from Australia to Vietnam because of the convenience, at all times considering them to be an average airline, including in Business class. <br>This trip has changed my belief. Their plane, food, service and amenities are equal to any now. Their staff, in line with Vietnamese people are the friendliest you will come across, making the flight a delight<br>They can now compete in the big league. The wait for transformation of this airline has been worth it."
406,Ja D,5,We have had 6 flights with Vietnam Airlines in 14 days and I am happy to say it has been a great experience on each occasion. All flights on time and relatively comfortable. Plenty of food and drink which was quiet good. Only downside was on 50% of the flights the cabin crew were not overly friendly. In fact they were very reserved. The other 50% was the opposite though. Might just have been long shifts. <br><br>I would be very happy to fly with them again.
406,Michelle T,4,The planes are clean and relatively spacious seats. Flights are short. Only refreshments are water or coke/Pepsi
406,Vanessa F,5,"We ( husband and 2 kids) went to Hanoi from London with Vietnam airlines.<br>The planes were good with a bit extra legroom. The stewardesses were extremely polite and helpful. <br>I really like the food ( they had an Asian option and a western option for main course and breakfast), there was also a lot of good snacks available and pot noodles too. The drinks (soft and alcoholic) were plentiful and the same standard as most airlines.<br>They gave each of us a small toiletry bag with all the basics.<br>Good entertainment was available too ( my kids played games and watched 2 full movies before they got too tired and went to sleep).<br>Overall a very pleasant experience with a great airline and a direct route."
407,SimundoW,4,"I did some thorough research on Vietnam Airlines before booking my tickets and discovered they had a pretty impressive safety record.  They were also cheap. Having now flown with them, I would also add that their customer service is excellent and the inflight meals are very tasty.  The slight downside is that the interiors of the planes are a bit shabby and could do with a touch up. But overall, this is a very good airline and I would definitely use them again and would recommend them to others."
407,Jan,5,"Have just returned from a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia where we used Vietnam Airlines for our international return flights as well as 5 internal flight 3 in vietnam and 2 in Cambodia.  Great airline with no hassels, we did have 2 changes to our  flights in Cambodia during our 15 day holiday but were notifed by email a few days before hand so no problems. Would highly recommend this airline."
407,Maree R,4,"A short 1.10 hour flight, we were served a light lunch by friendly crew. The seats were comfy and I would fly with Vietnam Airlines again. Boarding was from both ends of the plane and could have been better organized -  it was just pick an end and enter so people were crossing over inside the plane - not the best."
407,Krieg13,4,"Our flight was on Airbus 321. The boarding was a bit haphazard, when we exited the bus the plane was boarding from both front and back but no direction as to which entry you should take so once in the plane people were trying to pass each other on their way up and down the aisle. Once seated tho I found the seat comfortable and service was fast and efficient. Light lunch on a 1.10 hour flight. We left and arrived on time. All was good."
407,MyLinh S,3,"I have traveled throughout VN on this airlines since 1993, for both pleasure and work the services are very fine, the flight attendants are friendly, polite and speak and understand English well The food is fine too although not so necessary compared to the domestic flights in European countries and USA that serve no food only 1 drink and 1 tiny of crackers or peanuts. However THE MOST IMPORTANT NOTE THE VN BUSINESS OFFICIALS AND VN AIRLINES OFFICIALS MUST BE AWARE AND RESPONSIBLE IS THE FACT THAT THE AIRLINES LISTS SEVERAL DOMESTIC FLIGHTS IN THE WHOLE DAY TO MAKE IT AS IF THERE ARE IN REALITY SEVERAL DAYS PER DAY. BUT THEN THE AIRLINES HAS ALSO SEVERAL AND ALWAYS AND EVERY DAY FLIGHTS THAT ARE DELAYED, NOT ONLY FOR 1 OR 2 HOURS BUT TO THE NEXT FLIGHTS THAT MIGHT BE 3 OR 4 HOURS AFTER THE BOOKED FLIGHT. TO THE VN PEOPLE LIVING IN VN THEY ARE AWARE THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING. THEY MIGHT BE FRUSTRATRED, UPSET AND ANGRY AND IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT THEY ALWAYS PURCHASE BUSINESS CLASS SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER FLIGHT OR FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE BUSINESS CLASS THEY JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DELAYS! <br>TO FOREIGNERS OR PEOPLE LIVING IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DELAYS TOO SINCE THEY ARE ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN OR COULD DO! HOWEVER TO THEM SUCH KIND OF IRRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS IS NOT ONLY AN UNPROFESSIONAL SYSTEM OF DOING BUSINESS, SPECIALLY VIS A VIS ASIAN BUSINESS CULTURE THAT ALWAYS PLACES CUSTOMERS' WISHES AS BEYOND ANY CALL FOR DUTY<br>THEREFORE IT IS SEEN AS A WAY OR STYLE OF CHEATING AND DECEPTION PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE CHILDREN TRAVELING AND THEY MUST WAIT FOR MANY HOURS. IN my last flight back to HCMC from Dalat we had to wait from 5 pm until 9 pm since our 5 o'clock flight was cancelled and the next one was at 9 pm! And it is not just a randomly made complaint but it seems to occur with almost all domestic VNA flights and on each and every day and no matter for which location! <br>In June my family that includes 9 passengers with 6 adults and 3 children booked our flights from HCMC to Nha Trang and from Nha Trang to Hanoi. I booked the tickets and paid all of them ahead of times in April, the flights we selected apparently cost more than the other listed available flights.  In June 2 days before our departure date we received a message informing that our flights from HCMC to NHaTrang are cancelled and replace for a 2h later flight which means we would arrive to NT at 7 pm and our resort rooms were booked with no cancellation authorized and all was paid for 5 days and 5 rooms. Our tickets were also for business class seats. Then on our flight also on VNA from Nha Trang to Hanoi the flight was delayed and replaced for another flight 4 hours later. No drink no excuse are offered and the Nha Trang airport is not large enough for all passengers waiting for many other flights that were also delayed !<br>The VNA leadership officials should be aware that VN people in VN cannot do anything except being frustrated, upset and angry and the business leaders see such attitude as an Asian people reaction. However to the international communities such kind of system and style of doing business in VN shows not only irresponsibility, unprofessional policy and especially if as VN leaders and tourism business officials are bragging about how Tourism has been and is still successful for VN, soon or later there would be no greater support and respect to VN business and above all VN Airlines!!"
408,Peter D,3,"I specially booked and paid for Business class on this airline to experience their new A350 aircraft. My booking was confirmed on the A350, but a few weeks before the flight I noticed they had switched aircraft to an A321 without telling me. The aircraft was very old, in fact, it had metal plates covering the original ashtrays! The seats were stained and ripped. No effort had been undertaken to update the aircraft at all. What should have been a magical experience in a new state of the art aircraft was truly a let down."
408,Discover538586,5,"Comfortable seats with a little extra leg room. Polite and respectful staff and good food. Toilets were always clean and provided with toiletries such as creams, toothpaste and toothbrush. I would recommend it."
408,228lynnie,5,Our tour group used Vietnam Airlines twice in 2 weeks recently. Couldn’t fault the plane or service. Some of our group were even upgraded to the business class! Of course we enjoyed that privilege! We would use Vietnam Air again if we visited the area again.
408,Delder85,4,"Not knowing anyone who had flown with Vietnam Airlines we were unsure what to expect.<br><br>From the time of check-in to the on board service and options it was a pleasant experience. The staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The food and entertainment were better than average. And the seats were comfortable enough with ample leg room for a 9hr flight. <br><br>Overall it was a good flight and exceeded my expectations."
408,OnAir780829,5,Great friendly staff meals were good on board entertainment great easy check in I slept which I normally find difficult on international flights
409,Peter S,3,Bad luck. Catches an old plane. No video system. Boring. Difficult to sleep and seats are not allowing a sleep. <br><br>Service was ok. <br><br>Plane around 25 years old.
409,Peter S,5,"Wonderful airline. Only problem might appear when you want changes. <br>Nice plane A350 modern, well maintained, wonderful great stuff on board. <br><br>Try always to fly from Asia with Vietnam airlines. They are professional. <br><br>Planes quite and easy to sleep. Nice video programs."
409,RednAnnie,3,"Check In Ok, but do need to be there at least two hours earlier.  Don’t enjoy the transfers from terninal to plane by bus, on which you usually have to stand. Can be a bit of waiting round in the bus as well.<br>Flight  saws short and sweet."
409,Surly53,5,"Recently flew Vietnam Airlines and this was not my carrier of choice! I discovered this airline was new (Dreamliners), service and food impeccable and to my surprise free beer and wine with your meals!<br>Will definitely fly this wonderful clean airline again!<br>Neil"
409,Karen L,5,Very impressed with new aircraft and efficiency <br>Wonderful staff throughout company!!<br>Every flight we took off on time and landed early..<br>Luggage off plane quick.
410,RODERICK C,4,"We had never used this carrier previously and this time we had flights within to Hanoi and then to Cambodia. My wife needed wheel chair assistance due to a recent knee replacement operation. In all instances we received superb ground assistance and check in counter assistance.In particular the young lady who assisted my wife by wheel chair when we flew out of Hanoi to Siem reap. She was very knowledgeable and her English was fluent, However we later learnt from her that she had spent a few years in Australia with Vietnam airlines.<br>On board the flights the air hostess's were very helpful, very understanding and in all cases they organised the wheel chair assistance on arrival at our destination. My wife could walk down stairs slowly but on arrival in Hanoi our hostess organised a truck with a scissor lift so the chair arrived at the aircraft door and was then lowered to the ground. Very efficient but we felt slightly embarrassed.<br>An excellent caring airline which we hope we can book again in the future."
410,Lyn W,3,"We have had better airline experiences than Vietnam Airlines; leaving Melbourne at 10am in the morning, once they provided cabin services of dinner (what the!), they then turned out the lights and closed the shutters expecting people to go to sleep! We had only been up from a night's sleep for four hours. The did not have my special dietary requirements and did not serve tea and coffee due to turbulence (when a smoother ride they didn't come back), nor more drinks of any kind. The return flight from HCMC to Melbourne was no better. I would not recommend them."
410,cmbreuer2016,5,"We had a very pleasant flight from Danang to Hanoi. The staff were friendly and efficient, the aircraft was clean and due to good weather the view of the coastline was spectacular. We left and arrived on time."
410,Frank Reviews,4,Cabin staffs are friendly and responsive to your needs. The flight is smooth and the aircraft is reasonably new.
410,1fleet,4,We used this airline foe an internal flight while visiting Vietnam. They were very easy to deal with and able to answer all our question. The staff at the enquire counter had a very good understanding of conversational English and were very clear and easy to understand. <br>The staff on the flight were very helpful and had good English.<br>Would not hesitate to recommend this airline as a domestic carrier.
411,Trina G,4,"Only issue was that the flight was to be on a Dreamliner however it was on an Airbus, not that was a great problem it was just that we would have liked to try the Dreamliner.<br>Individual pods for all passengers and the level of service is inline with all Vietnam service ....friendly and efficient with the cabin staff always willing to assist and always with a smile.<br>The food and drinks supplied on this flight was of excellent quality.<br>Future trips to Vietnam will be with this airline"
411,Lynne W,4,"Great flight , on time , food good , staff great, seats could be a little bigger but overall great flight."
411,RSD78,5,Dreamliner aircraft is comfortable. Good media selection. Friendly staff. Good food and drink. Punctual service. Reasonable price. No complaints.
411,stoffel1953,4,"In the Boeing Dreamliner, Business Class featuring 1-2-1 Herringbone seats that you can lay back to have convenient sleeping space justifies aleady, in my opinion, the relatively small investment if you compare with other airlines’ Business Classes. The BIG advantage is: YOU ARRIVE RELATIVELY FRESH (if you manage to sleep during long haul flight) and feel almost ready to attack your programme on arrival with no major harm... - :) Beside that... Food and beverages are ok, even GOOD QUALITY - but do not expect Guide Michelin food - if you expect THAT quality: stay on the ground and go to a Michelin star restaurant ! <br>Service on board: Lovely but distant - matter to be improved...<br>All in all: Vietnam Airlines has already achievements, but is still on the way of learning... Let‘s encourage it !"
411,Eva L,5,"Gosh this airline is good. Not just because of the great value, but the whole experience is seemless. The planes are new, staff delightful, food is good and whilst other reviews complain about the blankets or the seats, I found the total experience fabulous. Even our 16 hour layover in Saigon was handled perfectly from stepping off the plane, visa prepared for you, driven to a luxury hotel and a sightseeing trip all included. I will be flying Vietnam Airlines as often as I can, and at the current pricing, I ask why would you fly anything elsr."
412,Trina G,4,"We flew Premium economy from Melbourne to Saigon and we found Premium with Vietnam airlines to be great, with a good seating and excellent cabin staff.<br>We would rate this airline far ahead of Jetstar and will fly them again, would be a good choice for a Europe trip via Saigon"
412,robertdascott,4,Plenty of spare seats.  Ok food.  Attentive stewards.  Modern plane and despite the negative reviews service exceeded expectations.
412,Ben B,5,If you are going to be spending 12 hours on a long-haul flight there are certain things that are going to make or break the experience which are within the airlines control (so can't necessarily count delays!) - service provided; in-flight entertainment; food and drink; comfort; cleanliness and availability of toilets; leg room. For all of these I can't fault the airline - staff were wonderful (though I have found that of other Far East airlines); food was more than passable; service was brisk and professional. In-flight entertainment kept my kids occupied so job done! I don't really care which films I watch tbh! Toilets on both outward and return were kept clean and available (except two of four in middle of aircraft that were out of order for last two hours of outward flight). For someone who is 6ft 3in tall and 'stocky' seat comfort and leg room is important. I managed as well as I ever have on any long-haul flight in economy. Cost us less than more established carriers so I have not a negative word to say about them. Would more than happily fly with them again.
412,558bev,1,Flew from Heathrow to Ho chi Min city landing at 5;20  stopover @'8;10 cancelled  10JUL . Next flight due 13;40 was delayed until 16;40. Trying to claim compensation from Vietnam airlines is a total joke .<br><br>Over a 10 hour delay which made us miss a whole day of our holidays &amp; still not getting anywhere with the complaint or compensation
412,Mary-lou H,4,This is my first time with the airline our trip to Hanoi was excellent and the transit was very well handled.The flight attendants ensure you know where to transfer and that your luggage is ready for transfer. Pillows and blankets ready available on both flights. A little cool overnight on the way home in the cabin.The attendants are eager to please and very hospitable.
413,coopipereed,4,We used OptionTown and were successful in getting a row of seats for myself and my two teenagers. Three seats each with a great range of movies. Three blankets and pillows each. The attendants didn't bother us more than necessary. I was dreading flying with bored teenagers but it was hassle free.<br><br>Due to a delayed takeoff we missed our connecting flight. Staff at Hi Chi Minh were very helpful and sorted it out for us and provided a free meal in an airport restaurant.
413,Sylvie B,3,Very good company no delay perfect flight and very nice staff <br>Although a little complexe to transfer in Saigon need to get our luggage and walk to the national terminal which is not that is easy travelling with kids and within the national terminal the counter was not that easy to find and at the opposite of the terminal <br>Another complain although my kids and I are all gold members of flying blue program we had to bargain our entrance in the lounge within Saigon although we should have access without arguing this point was the negative one of the trip they 1st sailed no access and 10 minutes later a man from Vietnam airlines catch us in the terminal to give us access to the lounge <br>Vietnam airlines should follow the flying blue policiy but it looks like they don’t ... or you need to argue to what you should get without claiming
413,fluffymonkey,5,"I'd spent some time reviewing the options for internal flights whilst traveling in Vietnam as our time was limited so wanted reliability. I'd read nightmare stories of some of the other budget operators in Vietnam with cancelled and delayed flights so decided to pay a little extra with VA. We experienced three internal flights with VA, all on time, seat leg room surprisingly generous, and efficient service at the check in desks. I would not hesitate to use them again.<br>For info, SkyTrax give them a 4 star rating and they've maintained that form for some years now."
413,Craig O,4,"Good flight ,pleasantly surprised with the quality of aircraft and staff, food was excellent as was cabin crew,food on returning flight from Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne not as good ,overall no complaints would recommend"
413,Bygaddy,2,My husband and I decided to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary by going ot Vietnam. I had been twice and loved it so thought my husband would too. i decided to book premium economy to give us some extra room - we are in our mid 70s so wanted some comfort. The trip over was just that. Very comfortable with two seats together. Coming home though we ended up with economy seats in a supposed premium economy cabin. It wasn't  there were passengers in there who hadn't paid the extra and others who had and were unimpressed with not having what they had paid for. I complained to the chief steward to no avail. Evidently they'd changed aircraft  and that was that. There was no attempt to rectify the situation by putting us in business which was virtually empty. instead we were given a complaint form to fill in and send to Vietnam Airlines. I look forward to more trips to Vietnam but i will use another airline next time.
414,Arez Abdulla,4,Vietnam Airlines is the country's national carrier and flies to several European cities. Unfortunately they do not fly to AMS. That would have been great actually... the service on board was good and cabin crew was friendly and helpful.
414,Sam Walker,5,All 4 of our flights were fabulous. We had amazing service and food in premium economy. Staff were really friendly and helpful and always something you could get to eat or drink. The dreamliner was excellent with lots of leg room and we would definitely fly them again.
414,Mhel F,5,Staff are friendly and helpful.Service of the airline crew are all with their smile and giving a good service so far.
414,Neil Bolton,4,"We had traveled from Singapore to Hanoi, then Da Nang, then Saigon, then to Singapore on Vietnam Airlines. Absolutely perfectly adequate at an excellent price. And no, I'm not damning it with faint praise.<br><br>To fly four sectors with any airline with no hitches at all is great, in my experience.<br><br>Everything was good - check in, seats, punctuality, staff - even the food. I'm tall - 6'5"" - and the legroom was OK for me, so it should be fine for 95% of people.<br><br>Bear in mind it's a low cost carrier though! And some of the other travelers may not be that experienced in flying etiquette . . . <br><br>It was our first experience on the airline, and we were in older planes - if we were to get the Dreamliner I would consider this a major bargain, and I think that's what they fly from Australia, so our next trip might be in that! (For those who haven't traveled in the Dreamliner - it's pretty much the best plane in the sky at the moment, particularly for long haul because of the much lower cabin altitude and the resulting wellbeing you get from that.)<br><br>(Actually - on reflection on one sector the seat was average to poor, but I'm not going to mark the airline down for that.)"
414,Peter V,5,"First time flyer with Vietnam Airlines - and wow - what a great experience. We were in cattle / ecomomy and really treated like special people. Being a dreamliner the planes are relativily new and are very comfortable. Food was tasty and drinks served accordingly. In this instance we had 2 internationnal flights and 4 internal flights and all were good, but the big ones in and out to Australia were very good indeed - not quite at Singapore level, but way above Hawaiin, for example. keep up the good work !!!"
415,peter b,3,not to bad on the flight over but on the way back they gave us a meal for dinner it was rubbish I asked for the other 1 they said sorry this is the only meal left because u are at the back of the plane all the other meals were gone pretty piss pore effort
415,LJY,5,"The service and food was outstanding on Business class both going over and home, always on time or arrive on time if slightly delayed., but their economy internal flights, are just like a no frills airline. Do not expect anything other than water, but in saying that, our internal flights were only all about an hour flying time.<br>Would certainly have no qualms in recommending this airline."
415,AlTraveler,4,"This review is more about the transfer from a domestic flight to an international flight in Saigon. The airline requires a minimum of 100 minutes between flights. Believe it. Schedule more if possible. We had 105 minutes, and it was close. After landing, you must recover your luggage, then walk (Or half run) to the international terminal, then recheck your luggage, then go through security, and then find your gate and flight. Vietnam Airlines did have someone meet us at the arrival door. He hustled us very fast (almost lost 1 group of transfers) to the international terminal. After checking our luggage, he pointed us to the security gates. Believe them when they say a minimum of 100 minutes for a domestic to international transfer."
415,DanOfArabia,3,Perfectly pleasant flight around Vietnam where the price matched the experience. The staff were helpful and polite. A good no frills airline
415,BecB3,4,"We flew Sydney to Paris and to be honest we were apprehensive as the cost was low and we didn’t expect a lot. <br>Vietnam airlines was surprisingly good. Newish plane, nice food and attentive service. <br>Would recommend"
416,OnTheCoastAl,4,"Flew both to and from Vietnam with Vietnam Airlines, both on the Boeing 787.<br><br>Flights were comfortable, even in economy!  The cabin was quiet, thanks to Boeing's newest aircraft; the food was sufficient and good quality (for airline food!); the in-flight entertainment was very good - a big screen with plenty of choice, and in most of the languages of countries served by the airline.<br><br>Cabin crew were also polite and helpful.  I would fly Vietnam Airlines again."
416,Brad W,1,"Shocking service I will never recommend them or use them again!!We had a overnight flight home to Melbourne.I was traveling with my three children and my husband.<br>They put my 10&amp;12 year old daughters next to a dodgey single middle aged man-on a night flight,him next to the window!!<br>My husband and 9year old son together,then myself 5rows back!!!!Of course I complained to which I moved my husband next to dodgey man whom refused to be moved,this should be child safety-particularly for an overnight flight!<br>Then they put me in front of my son,the rude male host was screaming at me”be happy now!!”I never been more upset on a flight ever,I asked this rude self-centred host his name which he refused to give!!!Vietnam Airlines should know he was the youngest male host on the flight-VN781 Sunday 26th August 2018,ho chi min to Melbourne!<br>I was soo upset I was trying desperately to hold in my tears!!!Not Family Friendly never again!!!!!"
416,Tony Shepherd,5,"Traveled on the A350 and it was a great flight a magnificent Aircraft so quite, food was good, service also, the check-in and baggage collection was also good, apart from a surly Indian Supervisor at Narita, I had difficulty in seat allocation and he decided that I was just a peasant and not worthy of any service, needs to go to Attitude school, but none the less I will say Vietnam Airlines do offer a very good international standard of service"
416,David D,4,"When I fist flew Vietnam Airlines, 10 years ago it was not the safest feeling. I remember one domestic flight when the air-conditioning kept dripping on my head for most of the trip. Today Vietnam Airlines is up there with the best of the Asian airlines. Check-in was smooth and friendly. The flight attendants are very professional and meals are served with plenty of time to enjoy. The weather wasn't the best but the pilot made the flight as smooth as possible. Despite a slight delay in departing due to the storm we arrived in HCMC on time."
416,HellenTiger,5,We flew Vietnam Airline 4 times &amp; we always enjoyed.The staff was very helpful &amp; nice.The flights were on time.The aircrafts looked good.Sure we'll fly again with Vietnam Airline &amp; we recommend it!!!!
417,cheberlein,4,If flying to Hanoi make sure you get a direct flight  !<br>We stopped first in Saigon then had to pick up our luggage walk a very long way outside to the domestic airport. Long queues to check in again and bad communication asto where to go .
417,Viajando p,4,We travelled from Hue to Hanoi in Business clas. The travel was perfect.  The staff very frindly. The plane perfect. The schedulling perfect too. The best form to travel inside Vietnam.
417,Dao L,5,"We used Vietnam Airlines to fly from HCMC to Hanoi, Hanoi to Da Nang, and Da Nang to HCMC.  All of our flights departed on time.  Yay!!  We thought the check-in process was easy and boarding the aircraft was orderly.  There was enough leg room (we're a short family). <br><br>We booked directly with Vietnam Airlines through their website.  When booking, make sure that you are on the official Vietnam Airlines website.  There's another website that looks like it could the official website but it's not and the ticket prices are higher than if you book directly with airline."
417,Colin D,4,"We flew Business Class with Vietnam Airlines from Australia to Europe last year and again this year.  Service has been more confident and assured.  Still not as good as Qantas or Singapore Airlines, but very good.<br><br>Planes used for international flights are the latest models, so good air pressure and humidity.<br><br>The lounge in Ho Chi Minh City is OK, but no where near Qantas or Emirates' lounges.  Vietnam Airlines uses the Qantas lounge in Melbourne.<br><br>Wines in Business Class were again very good.<br><br>Overall reasonable value for money, especially with a transit tour/hotel for the break between flights."
417,justindj d,4,"I have flown Vietnam airlines a couple of times now and not sure as this first time in Vietnam but do they always run late??? I been on 3 flights and all delayed from 10 min to 40 min. <br><br>All trips have been business class and can say check in is a breeze and quick , staff at checkin are friendly and helpful. A for that part. <br><br>Lotus lounge is good , lots of room and comfortable seating, however not much western cuisine however I do not fault Vietnam for that as it is their country just more an FYI for western travellers expecting it, <br><br>Service on flight is amazing and staff are attentive and polite and helpful, can not fault the personal service from Vietnam airlines<br><br>The one thing letting it down is the delays , maybe I just getting unlucky or maybe the standard but a great airline just please be on time"
418,Rie S,3,Company concept color is pretty light blue kind of color and liked it very much. The Bietnam hot tea they serve in a plane was tasty. Food was not so good. Few selection of entertainment system.
418,RosemaryNeill,4,"On the dream liner , seemed like slightly more leg room and on journey home managed to sleep better than any other long haul fights.  Comfortable seats and a good choice of in flight entertainment. We thought our agent ordered vegetarian for our daughter but there was none, however she was lucky as someone didn't want theirs, maybe have an extra couple in reserve each way. Crew friendly and pretty much on time for all flights. Would fly with them again."
418,Jefferson,5,"I fly Vietnam Airlines at least once a month domestically and internationally. Flight delays, gate changes, long immigration lines are just part and parcel of daily life in Vietnam. Vietnam Airports are getting congested that you'll find all these happening. <br>In recent times, Vietnam Airlines are definately improving their services. I was going to be late for my flight after arriving in Ho Chi Minh City. The staff held a sign and escorted me and another group of passengers to the international terminal. Granted, there is no through check-in between Domestic and International flights but hey, no other airlines provides this service in Vietnam. <br><br>They have upgraded a few aircrafts with the new seats which to be frank is not my favourite. I prefer the old seats which where way more comfortable and offered proper lumbar support. New seats were thin and made my back ache. Cabin crew are a mix - there are some really friendly crews out there and some who are not really smiling or interactive. Nonetheless, they get the job done - we get hot meals during the international sectors and light snacks or mineral water on short domestic flights. I hope Vietnam Airlines can keep improving on their service and quality to match the international big players."
418,Zyg W,1,"Delayed departure from Melbourne by 1 hour. When we asked ground staff if we will make our connection in Saigon ( we only had 2 hours ), supposed to be in Saigon at 4 PM and connection at 6 PM) the stupid woman said no problems, plenty of time. Well we landed in Saigon at 5.30 pm, had to get onto a bus to take us to the terminal, pass through immigration (there were hundreds of people trying to get through), pick up our luggage, find our way to the domestic terminal (by this time our flight had already left), get to the special counter to rebook our flight to Hanoi, this was already 6.20pm which was the boarding time for the 7pm flight, and the 2 ladies at the counter were having a heated discussion about who knows what. We finally got our tickets and had to go upstairs and pass through security, there were hundreds of people there and we would never have made it on time, so we decided to go through the air crew security lane, and he was good enough to let us through, so we finally made the flight. I would not recommend this airline to anybody. They also keep changing boarding gates, which happened twice to us on this trip."
418,Mary W,2,"We chose this flight because it was direct into Ho Chi Minh City.  Other times we have travelled via Singapore.  Unfortunately, the flight was very ordinary.  The seats are tight; the tv screens continuously broke down; in all seriousness, we had to ask the cabin crew to reboot the screens at least 10-15 times.  No offer of seat or upgrade.  The food was very ordinary; we were served a lukewarm pie at one stage. Staff was helpful. But by far and away the most uncomfortable aspect of the flight was the fact that the plane was so hot!  It was absolutely stifling and by the time we disembarked, my feet were so swollen I couldn't get my shoes back on! I also note that we took numerous domestic flights within Vietnam during our 2 weeks stay. EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT was delayed.  The Melbourne-Ho Chi Minh flight was delayed by 2 hours.  The flight home was better, because the plane was bigger and we had the seats by the emergency exit so had leg room. Given a choice, I would not fly with this airline again."
419,Sharron501,2,The flight was delayed numerous times no check thru of baggage and a really rude staff member at HCMC check in counter made it really difficult when you’re stressed about catching a connecting flight it took ages in line even though there were only 3 people.<br>Never again!
419,jlc20142014,4,A pleasant surprize!  Food was available at a variety of times on this long-haul flight and I found legroom better than many.
419,Essexnat,5,"Having flown long haul with most airlines this was the first time I’ve flown long haul with Vietnam. The plane was clean, food good, plentiful with drinks and an ok entertainment package. Seats spacious and comfortable, I normally get backache but didn’t experience on either outbound or return. Highly recommend"
419,Pisitheng,4,"I've been traveled with VA for quite sometime and I have seen lots of the flight crews need to work on their hospitality and smiling. My first flight with them was unexpected with the female crew was having had a very long day. She looks very tired and really need to rest but she was trying her best to be a good steward.  I guess, I might be a bit demanding on first impression but I didn't get. My have had many flight and I can see the same expression."
419,petertangmk,4,"The flight to Singapore was via HCMC. The flight from Danang was delayed by an hour, but no SMS notification was made. The transit time was barely an hour and ground staff should have been deployed to direct connecting passengers. We barely made it at the departure gate."
420,ChrisSimi,4,"Cannot find fault with this airline, except there was a 3 hour delay  leaving Melbourne. We had a stop over in Saigon which meant we arrived at our hotel in Hanoi at 01:30am after leaving home at 07:00am (Aus)."
420,AMC286,4,"It was the travel agent from Vietnam who booked our flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh via Vietnam Airlines.  At first, I was kind of doubtful if the plane was ok and the service is good.  My expectations were exceeded because the plane is relatively new, the crew are very helpful and they even offered cookies and candies considering that it was just a 2 hours 10 minutes flight.   The only negative factor was the inefficient queueing  system prior to passengers' boarding.  Priorities should have been given to passengers with children and senior citizens.    Overall, we are happy with the very good service from the crew."
420,juliehug,5,First time flying with Vietnam airlines. Very impressed with the first class service . Lots of attention. Signature drinks which were amazing . Food was incredible. Crayfish main course was better than some restaurants I have been in! Highly recommend this airline
420,OAPBeachlovers,4,"We choose Vietnam Airlines as we wanted to fly direct although we were a bit concerned as to the standard of the planes etc.  We could not have been more delighted not only with the service but also the planes themselves.  They were clean, comfortable, exception service, when I declined the meal on offer the hostess went out of her way to find something that I would like.   On our return flight breakfast was served whenever you woke up rather than all being woken as the convenient of the staff.  We really very surprised and won't hesitate to fly with them again"
420,Kerryk47,4,"Great Value for money, comfortable flight, food was good, staff friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment was good with up to date movies. We flew on the Dreamliner so it was  new and very clean. Staff at checkin were friendly."
421,hini4,5,"We flew from Frankfurt to Hanoi and return Ho chi minh city to London Heathrow. we are vegetarians and do not eat fish or meat, so we were not sure what type of food We might get. But we were  pleasantly surprised. Vegetarian  option was delicious, especially breakfast noodles. Thank you VN. likes of American airlines which I flew recently should take a lesson from you.<br>second thing I was very impressed by was the crew,  those boys and girls worked hard through long flights, very polite and serviced us with smile. well done guys."
421,anthony c,3,"This dreamliner is configured 3-3-3 so space is minimal. Our 2 flights were not full but still seemed cramped. Cabin service was unimpressive. After dinner, bottles of water were distributed and then ""due to turbulence"" coffee service was suspended. the cabin crew were invisible for the next 4 hours. Exactly the same happened on the return flight when turbulence was almost non-existent. Surprisingly, the safety demonstration was ignored by most passengers and the c/crew did not seem to notice. Overall this was unimpressive and hardly a reason to want to fly with this airline again."
421,Pam D,4,"We found the flights were all very organised albeit some running late but that really wasn't an issue and did not adversely affect us. <br>We were very glad that we opted for the 'Empty Seat Option' at a nominal fee. This meant that on the 2 long flights we had 3 seats each, meaning we could stretch out &amp; lie down - kind of like business class in economy.<br><br>My only critism would be that I called for service and had to wait half an hour for an attendant to come.<br><br>Otherwise mostly enjoyable as far as flying goes."
421,Robkarina,4,"I was presently surprised by the amount of leg room in economy (I'm over 6ft tall so normally an issue).  The cabin staff were attentive, the meals reasonable and drinks available on tap. The on board entertainment system was very good, with up to date films, music and programmes.  The only thing that let them down was that my wife's entertainment system didn't work on the outward flight and the staff were unable to fix."
421,Eleanorrigby,5,"Wasn’t sure about booking with Vietnam Airlines but the fact that they flew direct to Hanoi won us over.  Leg room was good, plane seemed new, food was surprisingly  tasty, service was excellent, films were the same as any other long haul flight.  Overall I would recommend Vietnam Airlines."
422,SevenSpaSG,5,"Friendly staff, enthusiasm, Responsibility and attitude are clear, pleasant. Help is positive. Feeling clean, polite and absolute safety. Flight on time, help me at work"
422,Carmel C,5,Once again Vietnam Airlines out did many other airlines. They are reliable and efficient. Every time I’ve flown with them they have left on time and their pilots make such good landings! You could hardly feel the plane touching down it is so smooth. On such a short flight they deliver drinks a meal and tea and coffee. Such a shock in this day and age where you generally need to pay for a seat let alone anything else. Recommend them whenever they are flying on the route you’re travelling.
422,briancadusch,4,Flew lot Vietnam 🇻🇳 once again 5th a bit dearer but makes up for service great people to travel with no stopgadd straight from Melbourne to HCMC   Cannot speak highly enough off them. Brian
422,altillett2018,4,Surprisingly bloody good airline. I am a loyal Qantas traveler however Vietnam Airlines have more legroom very comparable service and better planes for around the same price
422,NicandWes,3,"First things first, the plane didn't crash, so that's a big tick.<br>From there it was average.<br>Food was questionable, so decided to stick with having a beer and some bottles of water.<br>Flight attendants were rude, perhaps because we were Aussies.<br>Wont fly with Vietnam Airlines again"
423,DJandR,5,"Great value for money. Brilliant service, efficient and helpful. Plenty of room in economy, Selection of newspapers available for reading in the aeroplane. Meal provided during the two hour flight which included soft drink, and juices for free. Would definately fly them again."
423,Robert M,2,"Check-in: no problems. Efficient but not a smile to be seen during the whole process<br><br>Baggage: BE WARNED!!! If you check in at a domestic counter, VN will only check your luggage through to another domestic counter. So despite paying an expensive Business class fare, you will  still be expected  to pick up your baggage and walk it yourself between terminals (in Saigon in my case)... not a short distance in the heat.<br>Business class lounge: cheap and shoddy...lots of vinyl furniture like you find in youth hostels. And what they display as 'Food"" quite honestly looked like garbage...like kitchen swills... even the local Vietnamese turned their noses up at it. <br>Service: same as check-in, efficient but hardly 'charming'. If you want to see the first-hand evidence that Vietnam does not have a ""traditional culture of service"" unlike Thailand or Myanmar...look no further than the service on VN airlines.<br>Inflight food: 'dubious' is a generous term...lucky it was a short flight - I declined their offer.<br><br>VN airlines uses all the typical tricks of a State-owned airline in a competitive market.... even more competition is needed."
423,shamardani,4,Departing at midnight at midnight from SGN and getting on board the Dreamliner business class was simply the best way to go to London. Having tried the Asian and Middle Eastern alternatives this is the best option. Non stop 12 hours certainly beats the late night one stop experience Although the service and food doesn’t match the best of the competition the comfort level is extremely high.
423,KAOSVic,4,"I chose Vietnam Air because Business Class fare available was not much more than premium economy on other airlines. You get a lie down bed, comfortable pod, business class food and drink. Down side is that you arrive in Ho Chi Minh city mid afternoon and flight to London does not depart til about 1.30 am next morning. Airline offer of day trip and transit hotel did not work due to mix up with entry visa (mine or theirs - who knows). So got to spend 9 hours in their perfectly fine business class lounge! On way back, broke up London to Melbourne flight with a night in Ho Chi Minh city. Highly recommend this as flight arrives early morning Vietnam time and connection departs again late at night. This way I got to enjoy two days and a night in an interesting city and arrived home in Australia not jetlagged. Bonus!"
423,teamspud2018,4,"Flew return, upgraded to Premier economy for very reasonable fee, well worth it.  Dreamliner both ways, very modern clean and tidy.  Plenty of legroom, good VOD and good recline/legrest on seats.  Felt a lot like BA Club class 20 years ago. Food was ok, staff very polite and helpful.  Flew 6 internal flight on Vietnam A320s, good service, generally clean and tidy and on time.  Smallest seatbelts on any aircraft though on internal flights, I'm 6ft plus and needed a seatbelt extender for the first time ever!"
424,Tom B,5,"I have used Vietnam Airline before and was very happy with the service.Imredeived a call and mail informing me that because of exceptional circumstances there would be no Business Class available on my flight but I could either fly Economy with all the Business Class add ons or take a different flight 30 mins later.I decided to take the later flight. The mail point is how efficient,courteous and friendly they are. A great and comfortable Airline"
424,Foxlabrador,4,"We travelled on three flights with Vietnam Airlines while in Vietnam.   No problems at all.<br>All flights on time, planes very good, I booked all flights online and was informed of changes made to flight times even when a difference of only 10 minutes.   Would recommend."
424,mariajolie,5,Very nice service and good seat for customer. I hope i will come back to VN. It's a beautiful place and peace.
424,PyayTK,3,"My first experience with Vietnam Airline from Singapore to Hanoi with VN660 and VN661. Both legs is delayed for about half an hour and nobody, not even pilots, bothers to give explanation/update on what's causing the delay. On outbound journey, during the landing the window shade behind my seat is half closed, the crew didn't notice either. This goes to show how serious the crew is on the safety matter. The food and service is average."
424,Michael K,4,"Upgraded ourselves to Premium Economy on the trip home.  Only about $225.00 each.  While the food is just what you would get in Economy that extra leg room and reclining make is so worth while, particularly if you intend sleeping.  Drinks throughout the flight and very attentive staff."
425,Giancarlo T,4,This company provide very Good overall services operates with new planes.<br>The flight was on time. The floghts are the best solution for internal trips.
425,Scott,1,"Vietnam Airlines have a rewards program called Lotus, however you may as well use their program as toilet paper as it is utterly useless and they are not at all honourable.<br><br>Despite changing my preferred airline to Vietnam Airlines and booking all my flights directly with them (Melbourne - Ho Chi Minh (Rtn) and Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang (Rtn)) and inputting my rewards number they chose not to award any points on the basis of the class of fare and argued with me about it all.<br><br>What is worse is that you do not even know what class of fare you are buying when you book and pay for your flights.<br><br>Their deceit and fraud is disgusting and I shall NEVER be flying with them ever again!<br><br>May as well pay the same amount and get a business class fare with Jetstar and accrue QANTAS points!<br><br>Stay clear of Vietnam Airlines and their non existent “Lotus Rewards Program”!"
425,Pete K,5,"I was delighted with the entire experience from the room given to each passenger, the extensive menu and especially the flight attendants who were attentive and always ready to assist to make your flight as positive as possible. Highly recommend this airline to all readers."
425,Stéphane P,1,"Despite their band new long-haul fleet (A350 and B787) this airline is clearly not at the level of its international competitors. 1) its staff is not helpful: even with a business ticket and a platinum frequent flyer status, they refused to get me a seat next to the person I was traveling with. Don’t even ask why... it’s like this. <br>2) security is very questionable, starting with the row of seats blocking a part of the emergency exit (see the pictures, on Airbus A321, operating domestic flights) and the security leaflets not matching the type of aircraft. We had to fly back to Hanoi airport (on à Hanoï-Da Nang flight) because of a technical failure. <br>3) they lost my luggage on another domestic flight. Staff at the airport was unhelpful, trying to keep her kid busy (her kid at work, see the pictures) instead of helping passengers to get their luggage... <br>Trust me: JUST AVOID THEM."
425,Kevin R,4,"Short two hour flight which departed on time and arrived on time. Even though there was no gate and we had to be shuttles to and from plane, it was all done very efficiently and quickly and our luggage was there waiting for us when we arrived at HCMC."
426,Max H,5,"We upgraded to Premium Economy to SGN &amp; return to MEL so we were well looked after. <br> Other internal flights with Vietnam Airlines were Economy, Service at the airports was great considering the language barrier, service on the airplane was basic but acceptable.<br>We have no problem reccomending Vietnam airlines for your airline of choice if travelling to Vietnam"
426,Graeme S,4,"we had flown with Vietnam Airlines previously and had no reservations in chosing them again 3 years later.  The flight times, time in transit all suited our travel plans.<br>The only complaints might be that the cool drinks served should have been colder and the arrangements for transiting in HCM for Da Nang could have been clearer, luckily we had done the walk between terminals previously so we knew what to expect."
426,Fabio Ellis,5,"We had a very pleasant flight, in the counter the attention of the staff was super friendly, with a big smiles all the time, Cambodia airport small but modern, with a lot of restaurants and shops, in the food court area you can find many of the international brands... feels more like a small version of the U.K. Airport, But super clean... very impressive... Flight it was at time and service of Vietnamese people is just amazing super friendly, very warmy attention..."
426,busco2281,5,Have used Premium Economy on other Airlines and the seating configuration has to be by far the best i have had to date. My partner &amp; i are both tall &amp; i suffer with a severe back problem found these seats brilliant well worth the money.
426,chandon franck,5,"For my firt business flight it was amazing. <br>Hôtesses so pretty and kind.<br>Large place for sit, perfect for sleep.<br>Meals, drink and service hight level.<br>Plane be Airbus A350 no Noisy, no vibration and very biautifull inside.<br>Hightly recommended ."
427,Sieglinde G,5,"This shared Delta/Vietnam Airlines trip was from Minneapolis/St Paul to Tokyo.  Then Vietnam Airlines to Ha Noi.  Despite the many hours it takes to go such a distance, the space was as good as it gets and flight attendants helpful.  Upon my return, because there was a short time between flights in Tokyo/Haneda, an escort met me to be sure I would make it - and I did!"
427,HongSO,4,"We did an online check- in at home.<br>So we arrived at the airport just about an hour before flight time and we had no problem offloading our luggage at the counter.<br><br>Flight was on-time. Attendants were courteous and pleasant. Due to the weather on both our flights there were turbulence during meal times. There were no hot drinks served. However, on our return journey one of us asked for coffee before the turbulence started. So even though, it was announced that they will not serve hot drinks but one of the attendants remembered our request and told us that she will serve the coffee once the plane was out from the turbulence area - and she did!<br><br>I am not giving the 5 stars because it was rather warm inside the aircraft (not sure why?) and also there were no personal monitor set for entertainment."
427,jastod,4,Flight attendants very attentive to all your needs Good amount  of leg room. Meals were lovely. Seating comfortable . Toilets kept clean.
427,trayzi,4,"The flight was pleasant with friendly staff and good service, the plane was clean and all in a a pleasant flight. Other airlines could take a few pointers from this airline about service."
427,Karen F,5,"I was very impressed with the flight staff. Under economy there are many food options you can pre-book such as vegetarian, coeliac etc but, like most airlines, what you cannot do is specify particular dietry issues. I have quite a list of food allergies but the closest one to my needs was to opt for fish. One meal was fine but the next had tomato with it and I react very badly to tomato. The stewardess went through all the other options and then managed to put food together for me so that I wouldn't be ill. I was so grateful!"
428,Aloma D,5,"We flew on Vietnam Airlines from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang, Hue to Hanoi and Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City whilst we were touring in Vietnam. The airline was excellent and on time. The cabin crew were very helpful and pleasant"
428,Wander &amp; Wonder,3,"Took short trip to Danang. Had to transit in HCMC to get to Danang. Had to clear customs in Terminal 1, check out and walk to Terminal 2 for domestic flight. Flight was delayed due to heavy air traffic but had enough time to connect."
428,psinniah,5,New aircraft. Excellent service.Friendly cabin crew. Timely departure. Pity it was such a short flight. Could not experience in a true scale
428,Brian D,4,It was a very comfortable flight. In flight service was very good. Stewardesses were very attentive and pleasant. Flight was on time. New aircraft. Great experience
428,Leelee James,4,"But the flight attendants would not keep a job with qantas or virgin,  they were surly, practically throwing blankets at travelers.  It was clear they were in a rush at the end of the flight to serve a meal and clean up.  They were lax with the seats allowing travelers to stretch out in seats during take off and landing.  I loved the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Not scuffed, spacious leg room, I'm 5 5"" but have been cramped in the past. I could easily put my bag at my feet.  I was traveling with a friend and we both like aisle seats which we got and I was lucky enough not to have anyone beside me on middle section.  My friend not so lucky.  On our connecting flight we had one seat free between us on a full flight. So good.  It pays to be pleasant because airline staff make our break the start of your holiday.  Flight had great movies, I recharged my phone with the USB outlet and I the toilets are big. More roomy than I've experienced on countless other flights.  Use the ones in the middle section as they have a baby change table so they are more roomy, others all plenty of room too. As an airline,  I'd fly with them again.  Vietnam has not yet been gripped by tourism and so the customer service fundamentals aren't there yet.  The nice staff are that way because they are nice people. A lot of work to do on developing great customer service."
429,AshleyHenkel,5,"Great service, comfortable seat, good meal options. Plenty of space and privacy.<br>Will use them again when flying to Vietnam"
429,Ausburk,4,"An almost brand new A350, (had a small tech issue after engine start, costing one hour) but after that faultless to Da Nang and back a week later. The one hour delay cannoned so we missed the connection in Ho Chi Ming City. But they managed to get us on the next flight so we were only 45 minutes late. We sat mainly at seat 39 or 38 A&amp;B on 3 of the four legs, (18 E&amp;G in the A320 HCMC to Da Nang) the leg room was among the best we have ever flown. The meals were fresh and tasty and hot. They except 30Kg luggage and it didn't take long to arrive at the luggage pick up place. We both managed a short sleep on the HCMC to Melbourne overnight flight."
429,Bhat P T,4,"Booked my ticket through fly vietnam.com and got good rate. The flight was late by 15 minutes the Aircraft was very clean and seats were comfortable. I had booked for Asian Vegetarian Meal and was not sure what is in store. But, got fairly tasty  food and  staff are very attentive. Taking off and landing was very smooth. Over all a good airline"
429,Peter A,5,Vietnam's new Dreamliner is a dream..quiet smooth flight and great price.i have flown with Vietnam Air for many years because of the good value ...the Dreamliner craft makes it an extra bargain. Great service..good food and always on time.
429,Judith P,4,This airline was good to fly with. Plenty of room. Good service. Food ok. Toilets clean all flight. Good movies. Good reading too
430,lrpivictor@gmail.com,5,"The service was extraordinary.  The flight attendants were very polite, friendly and helpful.  They were prompt, courteous and very accommodating for some of our requests.  Lovely smiles throughout the flight."
430,cwiistrm,3,"Despite the delayed departure, flying in this twin-engine turboprop was a great experience. <br><br>The service was practically non-existing. Our tickets promised a meal/snack, but after take-off we just got a small bottle of water and after that we didn't see any service anymore."
430,CDeavin1819,2,"Unfortunately the flight I was on had a couple tour groups who were incredibly noisy and inconsiderate. My seat was at the back near the bathrooms and was constantly being pushed and shoved as people (including the air stewards) walked past. The whole experience was just generally uncomfortable, won't be booking with them again."
430,Tracey-Lee D,4,"We were flying to Hanoi, with a stopover and transfer in Ho Chi Mihn City. The first leg was excellent - we boarded and left to schedule, the inflight service and entertainment was very nice. However, when we arrived at HCMC , the transfer from international to domestic was handled very poorly - there was no general announcement, so it would have been very easy to miss, and the small group of us that were transferring were basically hustled out a side door and pointed in the direction of the domestic terminal with no further instructions. If one of the group hadn't been a Vietnamese language speaker, not sure where we would have ended up. <br><br>Apart from this, it was a positive experience. I'd fly with them again, I'd just make sure to clarify the transfer process before I left."
430,chelmont,5,"My partner and I were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the staff, airplane, and service.  In honesty I thought it would be sub-standard (my ignorance) but it was absolutely top class in all respects.  It certainly leaves Australian internal airlines behind."
431,Susan O,5,"We recently flew Vietnam Airlines return to Danang from Sydney via Ho Chi Minh City and were very impressed. The staff were lovely, attentive and nothing was a bother. You get slip on shoe/slippers and a tooth brush, among other things. I would definitely fly with them again and have already recommended them to friends."
431,Thepurplegirls,4,"I look forward to flying Vietnam Airlines again as the planes were great - new 787s - the staff were pleasant and the food was nice, if not a bit too Asian inspired (I don't know too many Westerners who enjoy hot noodle soup for breakfast).<br><br>But the layover in Ho Chi Minh city was a killer, in both directions.<br><br>On the way to London we stayed in the airport for 9 hours until our connecting flight and on our return from London we had 16 hours to spend until our flight back to Melbourne. <br><br>We ended up getting the Vietnam visa (a very costly exercise) and headed to a local hotel to sleep on our 16 hour layover, but it would have been much better to board our next flight to go home at the end of our holiday rather than wasting time and more money."
431,Lindas A,4,"We were able to choose our seats which was great as we are a large family.  Seats are average size.  Inflight movies were ok. Our flight ran out of beef meals, with fish being the only alternative.  My kids had noodle cups. Note to self: Pre order kids meals. Staff were nice.  Nothing outstanding about service or flight."
431,mimicchi,3,"Good food and friendly staff help a lot. Seat was harder side, made my legs hurting. Some cabin attendants hardly understand English. The big downside was that the domestic flights do not follow the schedule. On the way from London to Qui Nhon, my flight from London to Ho Chi Min was delayed by 1 hour, but magically, the connecting flight was also re-scheduled one hour later, and I managed to catch the flight with 100 min connection time. On the way back, flight from Qui Nhon was delayed by one hour, but no announcement at the airport hall, nor information at announcement board, nor ground staff. In the end, we got into flight and safely back, so it was all right. My colleagues had 4 hour delay in their flight. As reported in others, punctuality in local flights is an issue."
431,TOI_12,1,THIS AIRLINE has no reason to exist and their web site is not functional. The disaster starts when the international flight is changed to a domestic in Saigon and having to get the baggage from one terminal to another by walking and then going through security again on the domestic terminal......its a do it your self airline
432,michael123romeo,3,"Do apologies for late report! Let make it very easy to understand as I cannot take it need to get out of my system.. <br>My second time with Vietnam Airline (previous was November 2016 London to Saigon city (I prefer call Saigon than HCM city).. Reason I chose VN airlines again to see if there any improve? NO<br>In November 2017, booked a VN airlines from Saigon to Kuala Lumpur for my honeymoon as other airlines fully booked.<br>Well same old attitude, changed schedule in short noticed and late on departure! And no compensation or an appologies from the airlines... Seriously VN.. Unlike to other!<br>Just want all to know this is my last flight with them even if it free - ""I won't be back""<br>Not that cheaper! I rather flight with Emirates, Qatar or Singapore well known and respectable with good rate in term of services and punctuality.."
432,carm71,4,"I often fly business class and was looking for a cheaper fare and Vietnam offered an excellent fare $2000 less than Emirates or Etihad. I was very impressed with the plane, it was spacious and clean &amp; service was exceptional. Emirates is a class of its own however I would definitely fly Vietnam again &amp; highly recommend them."
432,ng_angie16,2,"In, short, it seems like it's worst than budget airline. very old fleet, lousy food and nothing impress me at all."
432,TheFilmyCouple,5,We are completely satisfied with Vietnam Airlines on our recent trip to Hanoi. The service as good and the flight was on time.
432,Christine H,5,"We took several domestic flights during our visit to Vietnam.  The airline staff were very polite and helpful.  They worked like a well oiled machine.  I was impressed with their logistics and how everything flowed so smoothly, from check in to getting through security to finding the gate and boarding the plane.  The seats were comfy for short trips.  The planes were clean and the flight attendants were very polite and all spoke English!  I would recommend flying with them again.  This was a much more pleasurable airline than expected."
433,Carmel C,5,Travelled on Vietnam airlines on 2 flights and was impressed with the efficiency of flights and service. The flight attendants were accommodating and gracious and the flight left on time dispersed passengers quickly and with ease at destination.  Couldn't believe the soft landing. Fantastic experience
433,itspene,2,Don’t know how they did it but l’ve never felt like a sardine before these flights. The flights are packet and the seats are so small l couldn’t sit back on the seats with my shoulders back. The in flight entertainment didn’t work properly on all the seats l could see. It was cheep and we got what we payed for....
433,kejanne,4,Comfortable trip and well served by the on board staff. Meals were satisfactory but not memorable. Would however go with them again
433,Adrian S,4,"Boarding was very quick,  even though there was a long queue. The flight left on time and the flight itself was without incident. The plane was very clean and the staff very friendly. Collecting the bags seemed to take forever and we were held up leaving the terminal as staff checked each passenger to make sure that they had the correct bags. Otherwise, it was uneventful."
433,Globaltraveller,5,"For an incredibly small amount on money, we opted to bump to Business for this short flight.  We were treated so well and had a private coach to take us out to the stand off flight whilst economy passengers were squished into a standard shuttle.  Vietnam Airlines staff are very pleasant and the fleet is quite new.  Friends have now flown them Business Class from Sydney to London twice and were very impressed.  We would not hesitate to fly this airline again but recommend looking to bump up if you can.  Well worth it."
434,jerjane,3,Do not turn a complete daytime flight into night time! I want to see flying over Australia and I feel it is done to reduce possible service. Also urgently required is especially for women. The toilet seat does not stay up when you are seated. NOBODY wants a potentially filthy toilet seat resting on their back. I tried to hold it back only to engaged the toilet clearance button altogether to difficult for a quick wee. Food only adequate
434,Pinky T,5,"we got the very cheap price to go to PAris by this airlines. at first, me and my cousin didn't really care about the airlines as long as we get the cheap price. but when we were on a flight, we were really surprised, the services are really nice, the cabin crew are so friendly, they serve nice food and the in flight entertainment is quite awesome, even the legroom not that spacious, but its quite good for economy class. i would definitely recommend this airlines to many people"
434,KPR1955,4,"This was the last of a sequence of flights with Vietnam Airlines whilst on a group tour in Vietnam. My first experience was from Siem Reap in Cambodia to Saigon which was a decent flight but a couple of flight attendants that were anything but. However, once within Vietnam and on the larger capacity jets the overall experience certainly improved.<br>The flight was on time, boarding was easy and non eventful and there was room on the flight to change seats if you wished. On the short flight there was no meal service and there was plenty of chances to see the landscapes down below on the trip to Hanoi.<br>The plane was clean, the seats were tidy and in very good condition, the flight itself was smooth and we landed on time at the domestic terminal. Baggage retrieval was OK, it could have been a little faster and then we had the usual baggage check for which I am very happy with the policy.<br>All in all a pleasant enough experience, that apart from my original flight from Cambodia to Saigon in the ATR72 all my other internal flights with Vietnam Airlines have been very good, professional and enjoyable."
434,Han Thanh L,4,"Checking in was pretty fast. The flight was pretty smooth, smooth take off,  smooth landing. The flight attendants were very friendly. Economy class on the A350 is very good, good leg room, good seats but no in flight entertainment. The food was horrible, I was served with some sort of pastry with meat inside kinda like a hot pocket, with yogurt."
434,SmurfSingapore,3,Staff's English proficiency is mimimal at the check-in counters in Vietnam. Requested for 2 couple seats as we were always given 3+1 seats but both times my request were ignored. I didn't asked again as I presume the check-in counter officer cannot understand me.<br><br>Flight was delayed for 1 hour to and fro Singapore. I nearly missed my connecting flight from HCM to Nha Trang due to the delay in SG and our luggage were the last to come out. So we have to take our luggage and dashed to the domestic terminal with the help of a ground staff. Will be useful if they can tag our luggage as priority for passengers with connecting flights with them so that time for the baggage collection is kept to mimimal in event of any flight delay. <br><br>Flight time was already changed for my flight from Nha Trang to HCM during my check-in but I was not informed by the counter check in officer.
435,mariewood57,5,"We actually flew Premium Economy for the first time, so I was elated to find we were to be treated the same as Business Class, express through check-in, customs and boarding. Saved is much time and did make us feel special"
435,❤️Reiser,3,The plane was ok but with very little space for European feet..<br>The staff wasn’t all that good in English but is was an domestic flight so you can’t expect anything else.
435,kanwilson,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our flight, all ran to time, in flight meal, lovely staff. The terminal is a bus ride but don’t hurry they have two so no stress. They are strict with luggage so buy extra ahead of time . No point flying business, seats are a bit wider maybe , it doesn’t look any different to economy ."
435,Umashankar,4,"Good service, had many counters at Hanoi domestic airport, counters 40 - 46, and check in was easy, was trying to take my bag as carry on and was told a limit of 7 kg Carry on and rest check in. <br><br>Airline provided service to stove my Jacket neatly, didn’t even ask to leave my boarding card in the pocket to identify me, they remembered me and handed it over to me as we landed.<br><br>Baggage handling was slow, had to wait some 20-30 minutes, may be its airport issue, but I have no complaints as the check in process at Hanoi was very good and smooth saving time."
435,David L,5,"My fiancé recently flew around Vietnam using this airline. Business class and one flight economy as it was booked out.<br>They’re very good. Check in is efficient, up grades easy, comfortable and staff lovely.<br>We are intending to further our experience with them in and out of Australia with their direct flights from Sydney.<br>Highly recommended. QANTAS take note!"
436,Paul C,4,We were surprised at the professionalism of the crew and the food selection. The crew made sure that we comfortable and well feed. Very clean and happy in choosing this airline.
436,Renomonkeyboy,4,After a lot of conflicting information about visas - online advice from Smart Traveller .gov.au. said that $25 evisas were now available. ( use the link from that website). New from November last year. Ground staff at Melbourne airport also very helpful in confirming authenticity. <br><br>Boarding with Qantas ground staff always good.<br><br>The brand new 787 Dreamliner is a fantastic aircraft and spaciously appointed in the economy section. Service was good. but ran out of meal choices on both legs. - no problems - i'd rather they did that than throw out uneaten food at the end of the flight.<br><br>Very impressed!
436,pacowvietnam,4,"Great Staff and food offering was excellent . Only bad issue is Business Lounge in Sydney, it is terrible. Really lets the airline down (and others as it is a shared lounge) .Only one staff member cleaning and restocking  buffet and drinks area. Made a coffee and left ."
436,AustraliaOwen,4,Was an easy and pleasant check in at the counter. Staff were polite and helpful.<br>Boarding was smooth and easy.<br>Seat were clean and comfortable.<br>In flight staff were friendly and polite.<br>Would fly with them again.
436,r0g54,3,"One general problem with Vietnam Airlines is that they cannot be contacted during the weekend or outside of business hours on weekdays. <br>The specific problem with this flight was mainly at Ho Chi Minh City airport. We were instructed upon leaving the prior flight that we had to collect our luggage. We waited for a long time at the carousel before 'accidentally' coming across our bags in a pile at one end of the carousel. They'd been removed by staff members but no one had informed us that this would happen. We were then short of time to catch the flight to Da Nang. The pathway to the baggage check was not clearly signposted and the staff who we asked along the way were vague in their instructions and seemed rather uninterested in our queries. When we finally found the bag check area, the queue was very long. We had a similarly difficult time finding our boarding gate which changed during our waiting time, causing further confusion. The flight was also delayed making for many annoyed customers after the earlier confusion and rush. <br>When we returned, the transfer was much smoother though both flights were again delayed."
437,mandymjune2018,3,Vietnam Airlines have squashed some extra seats in making it soo cramped.  The cabin temperature was ridiculously warm.  I don’t think I would fly with them again.
437,KarlFiona,5,"Purhased Premium Economy tickets at an excellent price and definitely worth the small increase over Economy. Check in was quick and had the benefit of the express lane for immigration and security at Sydney, beating the crowd. You also gain the benefit of early boarding and more overhead room as there are less seats per locker. The seating is comfortable and the extra leg room, width and space is great on the 8 hr leg to Vietnam. Food and drink was fine and the service from the cabin crew was excellent. The direct flights and price point in comparison to the other airlines make this a simple choice if you are travelling to Vietnam from Australia."
437,jackiedoman,5,"We bought reasonably priced tickets to London on Vietnam Airlines, expecting so-so service. We were so wrong. This airline more than surpassed our expectations. The planes had spacious leg room, seats that recline considerably and excellent service. The food in economy was excellent. I usually avoid any meat dishes on planes, but the beef and chicken were tender snd tasty.considering that this airline was almost $1000 cheaper than many others, it is well worth considering. The only drawback is the ling wait in Ho Chi Minh City for the connection but they do provide a free restaurant which is airconditioned and comfortable."
437,Sue B,5,"My husband and I flew with Vietnam Airlines last Tuesday unfortunately our plane was an hour late departing and due to bad weather the pilot was unable to make up the time, we had a connecting flight into Bangkok that we expected to miss. However on arrival we discovered they had held the Bangkok connection, staff guiding us through to the gate where we boarded the plane just in time for take off. Later that evening luggage was forwarded to Bangkok and delivered directly to our hotel a seamless experience, thanks Vietnam Airlines this could have turned out so differently, you went beyond our expectations we will continue to fly with you where we can.<br>PS. The new Dreamliner is amazing."
437,Cameron H,3,"Had the pleasure of flying Vietnam Airlines on board service was ok but departure and arrival times didn’t match our expectations, almost missed our connection."
438,gr3gm1tch,4,"Clean and modern aircraft. Good inflight entertainment, but would suggest you bring own headset with aircraft adapter. Staff are friendly and the food was okay."
438,01Markjh64,4,"I shopped around for prices and Vietnam airlines was actually about the same price as all the rest.<br>Just a Economy class seat. Well,  surprise - surprise, on time. The plane was a 777, fantastic seats. Plenty of room.<br>Good meal and free drinks / beers. Movie, what good go wrong - nothing!<br>Much better than Jetstar"
438,Sean O,4,"My family of 4 flew to Vietnam for 2 weeks holiday. We flew into Ho Chi Minh, took 2 internal flights and flew out of Hanoi, all with Vietnam Airways. All flights were on time and whilst the planes are not the newest in the sky, they were clean and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and looked after every need. I would have no hesitation in recommending them."
438,Greer E,5,We were recently traveling home to Hong Kong from Hoi An. We had to travel via Ho Chi Minh. There were severe delays but the staff were incredibly helpful and made a plan to ensure that we made our connecting flight in Ho Chi Minh to HK. There was someone assigned to ensure that we were guided to international departures and that we were given priority at check in. The staff were helpful and we couldnt believe the service that we recieved.
438,Chep,5,I have fly on this airlines lot of times because it's the best airlines that we have in Vietnam. I love flying in this airlines because the service is better than other airlines in Vietnam!
439,Sunil S,5,We were really suprised by the Excellent Indian Vegetarian Food served on board. The on board service was just great.
439,KPR1955,4,"This was a flight on a Cambodia / Vietnam package tour and the flights/airlines were chosen by the tour operator. I had an OK experience with my first Vietnam Airlines flight from Siem Reap to Saigon, but this flight was much more enjoyable.<br>The check in staff were helpful and efficient, we checked in as a group so no issues with baggage weights at all. but WOW when we got to the queue for security that was altogether another experience. It was packed and we had local people trying to push past us regularly, the strategic positioning of our hand baggage soon proved too much for them. Anyway, once through security we didn't have the 'sardine' feeling anymore. after the customary wait, we boarded and the gate staff, cabin staff were all very pleasant with smiles and nice greetings.<br>The plane itself was modern and very clean, and improvement on my last flight, and we were able to locate our seats quickly. <br>The flight must have been about 85% occupied.<br>there was no delay and we took off smoothly for the relatively short flight to Nha Trang, there was a small trolley service en route. there was no inflight entertainment, only the view from the windows. In fact the view was interesting when the cloud cover allowed you sight of the land. <br>After a short while we descended into Nha Trang and had a nice smooth landing. We were able to disembark easily and retrieve our baggage quite quickly. Vietnam Airlines had also employed a system where their representatives checked your baggage tag against your suitcase to prevent cases of stealing other peoples baggage. my first experience of this and one that i was happy with. Not sure how this would work in the larger busy airports though. <br>so all in all a very decent flight, service and conclusion."
439,KPR1955,4,"This was my very first experience of Vietnam Airlines and was part of a larger package of flights etc with a group trip. <br>I was very lucky that literally the moment i walked into the departure hall for check in they decided to open the desks and thus I was first in line. As I had been travelling long haul and was actually granted 30kg baggage allowance, this was not valid for my internal flights I found. However, i was only 3kg over the 20kg allowance since i placed almost everything into my suitcase. this seemed to cause an issue to the check in person, who insisted i either take out 3kg or pay for the difference. I asked him rather nicely if there was any flexibility as i would then hold up all of the queue and in any case the 3kg I took out would only go directly into my hand luggage's whats the difference? He called his supervisor and she let it pass thankfully.<br>So, boarding pass issued and through security into the lounge. Siem Reap is a rather gentle,cute airport reminding me of exotic locations. The flight was on time and was with an ATR 72, which I hadn't flown in for over 20 years. The flight was actually around 40% occupied and so it was very spacious.<br>the staff (2 persons) did seem a little like they would rather be somewhere else but.....<br>The flight was very short, it was comfortable, uneventful, there was no trolley service of any kind, but on such a quick flight the fact is to get it over with unceremoniously. This was achieved.We landed in Saigon and there was no issues retrieving my baggage nor exiting the airport. Objective achieved with no issues."
439,KPR1955,4,"As this was not my first experience of Vietnam Airlines i was interested to see if their standard was influenced by class of plane or by route. <br>the check in etc. was efficient and not having to wait in excessive queues, the transit through security was easy enough, but that is not the responsibility of Vietnam Airlines, and the flight was on time, which was very pleasing considering the boarding time of 05:15!<br>Boarding was via a bus to the plane which was not really an inconvenience and we were able to board via the rear steps as our seats were located at the very rear of the plane.<br>The Cabin Staff were very polite and the cabin interior was in good condition. <br>It was a very quick flight, we took off roughly on time and arrived similarly, the flight was uneventful with glimpses of the country through breaks in the clouds.<br>Disembarking via a jetway we then had to wait about 25 minutes for our baggage and it was actually a good idea to see that representatives of Vietnam Airlines were checking that our baggage receipts matched our suitcases, first time i had come across this.<br>Overall a very pleasing experience."
439,phillinet,4,We flew Premium Economy allowing ourselves more room and had a very comfortable flight with good service. The extra money on the upgraded ticket was well spent. unlike other airlines I have flown with there was no priority boarding with this ticket.
440,Joanne L,5,"Having flown the world with all the huge airlines mainly Middle East airlines what a huge surprise to fly with Vietnam airlines and to discover that this short haul flight was so much better than the leading Middle East flight operators! So many attentive crew present who were so helpful, a modern Dreamliner craft to travel in and best of all my husband was offered a seat near the exit at no extra cost as he is so tall. Infact this is how airlines use to be and the usual cost cutting exercises are so noticeable now in the western globe. So Thankyou Vietnam Airlines we wish we could use you again on a long haul route sometime as we would enjoy all the extras you provide ."
440,thomas n,3,"My first time flying with Vietnam airline London to Saigon and vice versa, the flying time is over 12 hours non stop. Services both ways are poor, flight attendants only seen around when they serve food to customers. Most of the time they are in the back of the plane."
440,Thierry O,5,"I have used Vietnam Airlines twive now from Australia to France and enjoyed it.<br>The Premium Economy is great, good value for money. Space and Service are greats."
440,Sam N,4,"I flew business class.  The cabin was pretty much as expected.  <br><br>Boarding at Heathrow was good - Business Class first.  On the way back they had a separate line, but they did not monitor who joined the Business Class queue, so it was heaving.  Irritating.<br><br>The lie-flat bed is ok - I am 5ft 8, was ok for me.  Much taller, and you will be a bit cramped.  Pillow and blanket provided.  It's very hard... so I could only sleep on my side, really.  But so much better than being in economy!  On the return flight, which left at c. 1am, I was really tired - so I managed 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  Lovely...  Much needed.<br><br>Food choices are ok - I didn't much fancy them.  Lots of Vietnamese/Asian influence - but then, what would you expect?  On the return flight, the 3 main courses were fish, prawns or duck.  I don't like any of those.  :-(<br><br>No complaints, really.  Would prefer to fly BA or Virgin, but not available on this route."
440,Debbie R,5,"Very happy with the Service from the Staff on the Vietnam Airlines, won't hesitate to travel with this Airline again in the future."
441,John S,3,"We travelled with Vietnam Airlines on a recent trip. The day flight over was great, clean, pretty good food offerings for both lunch and afternoon tea, attentive and friendly staff. In all I would recommend a day flight with VA, but the return night flight was horrendous. Late departure. Sat on the tarmac for 30 mins no explanation. Plane full of some of the most vile individuals i have ever meet. I am not sure if people think is acceptable on a plane but this full flight i hope to never repeat. The smell of some passengers a bit off, 2 kids kicking the seat behind us for most of the journey even after being asked numerous times to stop, the boy in front bouncing like he was in a trampoline park and the talons on the women who kept stretching and leaving her hands across my daughters video screen where from a horror movie. My daughters child meal went missing so she was offered something spicy or something spicier, ended up eating 2 bread rolls and some milk. Where the confirmed child's meal went there was no explanation. My husbands video screen did not work even after it was reset. Makes for a very long 8 hour flight with no entertainment option and the noises through out the flight being made by the man sitting opposite us i can't even begin to explain, other than they were quite disturbing. I know economy right, suck it up, but we have flown many economy flights and I have never experienced anything like this flight. I believe  unless a day flight both there and back is on offer we will try another airline."
441,Gerard S,5,"Whilst I have read mixed reviews on the Premium economy quality of Vietnam airlines by others, we were very impressed with the comfort of the seats and service. Whilst you don’t get the meal service standard I got on Qantas PE in terms of plates, table cloth  etc, it really did not matter to me.  The food was good and overall service excellent.  Well worth it and a very reasonable price. I recommend it."
441,Tricia M,5,Premium economy was worth every dollar we spent.  Not that expensive and the extra room was great. The food was ok and we were looked after very well.
441,Pete K,5,"Great Airline. I was delighted with the level of service, the excellent flight crew and the meals. I also fully enjoyed the selection of videos available to passengers."
441,James F,1,"Simply put Vietnam Airlines is not one that any seasoned traveller should consider. VN55 from HAN to LHR on 12/7 was my first flight with the airline. <br><br>Firstly the HAN lounge was dirty and the service poor. But nothing compared to the flight.<br><br>Once on board the crew were distant, no member introduced themselves as is usual in Business Class. The seat was only just adequate, it goes flat but is generally too hard to be comfortable. The pillow and blanket also belong in economy. Amenity Kit very basic. Cannot comment on dinner but breakfast was pretty good.<br><br>The main issue was that there was a Vietnamese family group traveling in the same class. Grandparents, parents and about 6 kids aged roughly 5-6. As they board they were far too excited but did settle and sleep quickly, however with about 5hrs still to run they woke up and caused utter mayhem. Screaming at each other and climbing over seats. This woke me and my fellow passengers up. We complained. And the basically still did nothing effective to stop this. After speaking to the main cabin service director I asked for a complaint form, once filled in another member of the crew who was apparently in charge of the section then confronted me on my way to the rest room to challenge my opinion. He continued this even after me saying that is my opinion and could he desist. <br><br>Overall there is nothing good to say about this airline. If you need to get to Vietnam go via DXB, SIN or DOH as two legs, double points and a far better business class product in every single way."
442,Ron009,1,We were booked on VN780 from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh on Monday June 25. After checking in and passing immigration we waited for departure st our gate. Official announcement informed us that our flight was delayed.  After approximately  2 hours we were informed again that it was again delayed. We were given lunch vouch dr rs to use in the airport. At approximately 4pm in the afternoon we were informed the flight was cancelled and had to go back through immigration and collect our bags. We were then transported to a nearby hotel for what we thought was an overnight stay. Unfortunately in the morning we were again transported to another hotel and given lunch and dinner vouchers.<br>At no stage did Vietnam airlines give us any information as to what was happening.  Lack of information and very poor communication.<br>On the afternoon of the second day we arranged alternative flights to our destination at our expense so as to be able to start our organized tour.<br>I believe the initial flight left on the Wednesday afternoon<br>Would never use them again
442,Nikko X'mas,1,"This is kinda must-go because we don't have many choices. The flight was delayed, but I wasn't noticed at all, and only knew once I came to the airport. There were not enough blankets on the plane, so that people were kinda fight for blankets :(<br><br>If you have better choice...don't ever think about this kinda sorry airlines."
442,Leone S,5,"For $200 extra flying Premium Economy is the only way to fly home on a overnight flight, after a long day! Its the comfy way to come home! Business Class is financially out of the question, but upgrading to Premium is the best choice for those who don't have the money to fly Business! So much more legroom! We felt $200 extra was very reasonable to pay for the extra comfort. We checked in separately, boarded separately and received lots of pressies in our flight gift pack. Well worth the money! Do it!"
442,SwizerlandRoisinDubh,5,"New planes (A350), super friendly crews, timely flights, comfortable chairs: what else can you want from an airline!! Great future in store for airlines like these!!"
442,Mike S,4,"Have flown this leg many times over the years. It used to be an ATR 72 (Twin prop) which was quite cramped, but still fine. Vietnam airlines now uses a single class 737 for this short flight (about 50 minutes) which is fine. The price is ok by comparison to some of the newer low cost airlines that have entered the market in recent years, however I've found Vietnam airlines flights to be more reliable than most."
443,Mick C,3,Business class on this airline is the cheapest business class to Europe and the quality of the flight service etc is quite good.  The only downside with this airline is the long stop overs (more than 8 hours on the way and 19 hours on the return flight) They do put you up in a hotel usually some distance from the airport meaning a long bus ride through heavy traffic.  We will probably pay the extra with another airline for a shorter duration trip in future.
443,anamaria67,4,A modern airline with new planes and remarcable service. Departs and arrives in time and has very good prices. What else can we ask?
443,justinemoeke,1,"Arrived to check in handed boarding pass. As i moved to security noticed the boarding time was late, the flight was delayed by 3 hours but none of the staff had mentioned it when I checked in. It went downhill from there. Finally took off 30 mins past time only to circle Ho Chi Minh city for an extra 1.5 hours. No announcement from the crew or captain and no apology at all. Oh got a small botle of water for the delay. Wow can you sense how underwhelmed I am. The total lack of information from anyone associated with the airline was staggering. I will never fly with this airline again. I do not recommend anyone using them. Take the bus or the train. It will take you 8 hours anyway.... At least on the train you will be moving!"
443,julanbarker,5,"We had no problems with our flight. The crew were friendly and good service. There was plenty of room to spread out due to the flight not being full and the check in staff were helpful with regards to this.The space in economy was quite good. I would travel with Vietnam Airlines again,"
443,Judi T,3,We have used Vietnam Air for three of our holidays we recommend highly they have the Dreamliner which is very comfortable service is good  food is okay in flight entertainment is very good we have also flown internally to Danang never any issues
444,ZHANG96,2,The Vietnam airlines A350 premium economy class seat is kind of just like another economy class seat as the cabin layout of 2-4-2 which make the passage way very narrow and also you don’t feel spacious at all as in actual fact the real premium economy class product is on Boeing 787 plane instead as the seat pitch are much wider and seat configuration is 2-3-2. The A350 is a inferior product of Vietnam airlines as I think VN should do something to change the seat pitch and configuration just like 787 instead! If not I don’t think they should called those seats as premium economy class seats as in my opinion the seat are not comfortable for long haul flight! Also the flight attendants never care to clean up the toilets as it is very dirty half way through and toilet paper not replenish as well!
444,KIM S,1,"The worst flight experience in my life. <br><br>Before using this airline, I arranged my seat through web-checkin. It was a seat which have more leg space than any other seat. I'm quite taller than others, so the space quite important for me. <br>But when I found my seat, one Vietnamese lady had already occupied. So, I politely told her it's my seat, not yours but she didn't move at all. Rather she just pointed her finger at the next seat which was originally hers and wanted me to sit there. It was quite RUDE!!!!!!!<br>But I thought a cabin crew next to me would deal with this situation professionally because the cabin crew had seen this situation from beginning to end. <br>But, unfortunately, he didn't take any actions for me AT ALL. He was just looking me like ""why are you looking at me"". OMG...<br>I was totally disappointed with non-professional attitude of cabin crew. Why does this airline have advance seat assignment system? The system is useless in actual flight. No use. The seat is deeply related to the safety of the flight in case of emergency as well. But they didn't seem to think like that. <br>This lady was totally ruined my flight. During the flight, the lady wiped her runny nose and threw her tissue into my seat pocket! And the passenger behind me put her feet on my arm rest. <br>It was TOTALLY terrible and disgusting. Whatever you imagined, this airlines go way beyond your expectations at the worst part.  One more thing, most of crew members were bad at speaking English. And I couldn't find any effort to secure the safety. During the takeoff and landing, I saw some people didn't put seat back upright and crews didn't mention it even though they witnessed it. <br>4stars? I can't agree with that. Need to improve this situation right now to be real 4 stars airlines. I can say that it was the worst flight experience for my life and I have no idea to use this airline again. Terrible."
444,Teena123,4,"This my third flight with Vietnam airways ..comfortable , nice staff and very good value for money ..just flew premium &amp; business from Sydney to London very good ..that’s my second trip to London with them plus I flew to Vietnam with 3inyernal flights also ..excellent"
444,SquizyTaylor,5,"We had my first business class experience and we will all find it hard to return to economy. The experience started with access to the Lotus Lounge at Heathrow. Prioriry boarding had us seated having a drink of bubbly well before take off. Facilities and staff made the experience brilliant. Price make this available compared to the big Airlines and we traveled in a dreamliner all the way. Draw back was a reasonably long layover in Ho Chi Minh (14hrs). The Airlines does offer a tour or accommodation service to ease the pain. Menu was biased towards Asian quisine, not unexpected considering we were flying on an Asian Airlines. Overall an excellant experience and would recommend."
444,bernard l,4,"One thing I noticed in the past few months flying in and out of Saigon to regional destinations: flights on Vietnam Airlines or VietJet are always 90% full. <br>Both airlines do a reasonable job at making sure passengers are taken care of. Vietnam Airlines can be commended by the fact that its airplanes are generally fairly new and clean. The only issue, which may have nothing to do with these two airlines, is on-time departure: always late."
445,lichefong,4,"good lunch, easy and pleasant flight, waitress service nice, short distance makes it is not hard to go thru, there is two hours flight only"
445,Cheryl W,4,Vietnam airlines is very good. Efficient from Melbourne but late leaving from Ho Chi Minh. Planes comfortable and food pretty good for aeroplane food. Will fly with them again definitely. I would suggest Vietnam airlines too
445,Terry Anzur,3,"Domestic flights within Vietnam are a no-frills experience. There's a long line to check-in at the domestic flight counter, so allow time. Seats are assigned and roomy enough for a short westerner like me and most Vietnamese. Some honey crackers and breadsticks were served in a box, and you can pass the time on the flight by unwrapping each individual piece within the bags. Soft drinks are water were offered in small paper cups, as well as coffee or tea with no alcohol. Still, they get the job done. They notified passengers well in advance that the flight would be delayed 30 minutes and got to the destination at the promised time. Fastest baggage claim I've ever experienced. The bags hit the belt in Can Tho about 5 minutes after we landed."
445,hhx2_12,5,"We treated ourself to Business class this time.<br>The Crew from Sydney to Hanoi wasn't the friendliest. Looked like they were not really in the mood....<br>Food was amazing, plane looked clean, Seats were comfortable, Entertainment wasn't the best. Lots of old movies.Also on the flight home same Movies...<br><br>At 4.30pm they switched of the lights and darkened the windows.<br>Looked like they wanted peace and quietness.<br>Most of people started to sleep.<br>We lightened up our windows and enjoyed the sun light.<br><br>After 2 hrs stopover we boarded the next flight to Paris.<br>By the way they have a new Business Lounge which looks great and is very comfortable with lots of Food to choose from...<br><br>Beautiful service, lovely Staff. What a difference on our next flight...<br>We enjoyed our flight with Vietnam Airlines....."
445,dyen508,3,Flight was ok however they did not give us earphones so there was no point having the screen on in front of everyone. The food was not great. Pork was tough and noodles were bland. There was no salt/pepper provided.
446,Melinda B,5,"We were looked after so very well, even though we were lucky enough to be upgraded to business class drinks before take off, linen table clothes and china for meals, and a whole bed each. We felt as if nothing was any trouble and were always met with a smile. <br>They are a pleasure to fly with, from the smooth take off to the smooth landing."
446,naturebleu,3,"What ai didnt like about this airline is. They keep changing your schedule. It is like they changed our flights 3 times. But the good thing was, when we were going back to hanoi, we checked in early and they asked us if we want an early flight. <br>Staff are friendly."
446,Fabian O,4,First time flying with Vietnam Airlines. Booked a spare seat between window &amp; isle seats so we had more room to move on a long 9hr flight
446,Cazza P,3,Boooked from Saigon to Singapore the flight was being changed from different terminals which you really had to listen out to there was a massive storm and no direct access to the flight needed to go down to the Tarmac hop on a over crowded bus to take you to the air craft with so much rain needed to wait around 20 mins on the bus for the rain to ease and eventually get onto the aircraft the weather was out of anyone's control but the cattle like conditions on the bus was totally not acceptable very average flight
446,Jimmy B,3,"Flew Vietnam airline -  to Vietnam the flight attendant were friendly and very good at their job so was a pleasant flight .However the home trip from Hanoi was totally different the staff seemed very unorganised and food choices were terrible. My wife &amp; I were at the back of the plane and by the time they got to us each time there was no selection of food only pork or pork which my wife has an allergy to pork . I tried it but it was not pleasant to taste ,so improving the menu would be a plus for them."
447,Chrystel C,1,REFERENCE DOSSIER MBQSDY<br><br>We bought two plane tickets from nice to hanoi a 470 TTC<br>it started well<br>just a few days later I am told that my flight from Nice was delayed and as a result I would miss my correspondence for hanoi a paris<br>I tell them no worries<br>put me on the flight before to be sure that I will arrive so much to take my correspondence in paris<br><br>well I am asked 230 euros extra!<br>after a multitude of emails exchanged and lost hours<br>I ask my confirmation that my ticket has changed well from Nice and asked them how I proceed to payement (still very nice!)<br><br>it was still not done and I am told that the rates have changed and that I must pay 230 euros per person this time to be on the plane that will just allow me to take my plane to Hanoi!<br><br>false advertising!<br>total scam!<br>I asked for a total refund of my trip which went from practically double to almost!<br><br>do not validate tickets especially !!
447,Boz80,2,"Had four flights with VN, 3 of which impacted by cancelation or significant delay.  So poor realisability.  The airline didnadvice via email of major delays or cancellations. <br><br>Handling of these delays met with indifference until you pursue the issue.  Once pushed on issue (after third issue) they provided free meal with poor directions as to how/ where to claim.  <br><br>Unfortunately the quite modern fleet is not leveraged (Dreamliner).  Great entertainment system, (with massive choice) was accessible as we seated only to be over ridden 20 minutes into the flight with a single show.  Upon pressing the call button to obtain earphones, no one attended.  Once we interrupted a flight attendant walking straight past our seats (all with Call light on) we were advised flight too short (2 hours - Hanoi to CMC) to have earphones. <br><br>Maybe no worse than others but it’s a shame as they seem to have a reasonable modern fleet and infrastructure, let down by reliability and odd service policies that disappoint."
447,Annette A,5,"Great flight to Hanoi &amp; return to Sydney, on a new Dreamliner. Great service, nice food, on time &amp; good selection of entertainment. USB connection on back of seat in front of you, easy to work entertainment centre. A good choice for comfort, quietness and mode of travel. <br>Highly recommend this airline service."
447,Darrell O,5,"I found Vietnam Air to be efficient, with good service and better than average seat comfort.  Having flown many no frills, low cost airlines for short (&gt;2 hour) trips within Asia, based on research and reviews, I tried this airline with the hope that an economy seat with them would be something more than a sardine can.  I found their seats to have more room, and definitely more comfort than others, including Air Asia (which I avoid for negatives on all of the above).  Free beer and wine, and a decent/ok meal, I will definitely fly them again.  The roundtrip fare was 15-25 percent higher ($30-$50 USD) than others, but well worth it for the comfort."
447,Chester H,5,I hate Asiana since their service went wrong. KAL is good choice but pricy. so i decided Vietnam airlines to visit Hanoi. turns out it was wonderful choice. very clean and new jet meal is wonderful. I willing to take this flight anytime.
448,tawon26,3,"Service is average, especially at check in counter in Hanoi Airport, crowded.<br>They do not accept group check in, and after that... delayed flight :(<br><br>As we return back to Hanoi, they can not help for luggage check thru ... since we just transit for 4 hours in Hanoi, our connecting flight with Singapore Airlines to Singapore.<br>It is not convenient... we must take out our luggage in domestic terminal, and bringt it all to international terminal using shuttle bus...<br>And again.... delay :("
448,DesaVilla,4,"This is my third time flying with Vietnam Airlines from Kuala Lumpur for my family holiday.<br><br>2016 1st time KL to Tokyo<br>2017 2nd time KL to Hanoi <br>2018 3rd time KL to Seoul - Busan back to KL<br><br>I think for the prices you pay for full service ( Meals - Inflight Entertainment above 3hrs and 30kgs of Baggage allowance ) you cannot go far wrong with this choice.<br><br>Do note that when flying from KL to Hanoi or HCM, due to the short distance, they are using smaller places such as Airbus A310 and there is no personal  inflight entertainment.  But for the flights from Hanoi or HCM to Seoul or Osaka, there is inflight entertainment.<br><br>Food quality is quite good and the flight attendants are friendly and responsive.  Leg room is also sufficient and the recline on the chairs are also decent which is quite impressive for the price you pay.<br><br>At the of the day, if you compare a Budget airline with additional charges for food and baggage, it may be just about the same.  In my case, the cost was even cheaper than budget.  Just only you have to consider a layover of 2 to 3 hours, which i think was ok since we are on holiday anyway.<br><br>In 2016, while flying to Tokyo, i took a 2 night stopover in Hanoi just to have the opportunity to explore another place and am glad i did.  This city is very beautiful and with many good shopping and food choices.  Loved it so much that i took another trip to Hanoi for another 7 nights the next year.  So i you do fly via this airline, do take advantage that you can do a stopover.  <br><br>Will be planning for another trip with this airline in the near future."
448,Neil S,4,"We started our Vietnam holiday on Hong Kong and connected to Hanoi on VA - the flight was fine, staff friendly.<br>The aircraft was looking a bit tired (which was expected) and the foos was distinctly Vietnamese.  Nothing flash, but every landing is a good one!"
448,James P,4,My wife and I have just returned from holidays in Vietnam. We flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Min city.the flight was ok and the service was quite good the meals that were served were quite nice and ample.The only problem was we had centre aisle seats and they were a bit cramped for leg room the window row seemed to have more room between them. over all it wasn't that bad next time we will try and get window seats
448,Lionel F,5,Decided to fly straight through with a 4 hour change in hanoi.opted to pay a little more for premium economy.it was an excellent decision  as the extra room meant a good sleep.<br>Service at check in and on the plane was excellent and attentive.<br>Food was nothing to rave about  standard economy offering.Paid to visit the hanoi airvietnam lounge for a shower and change of clothes.very busy and crowded at first but virtually empty later on.bit expensive but worth for the comfort and facilties provided.
449,Sheryn L,1,"My son’s girlfriend cancelled his flight from Melbourne - Saigon when we flew in the morning. Vietnam air then cancelled all of his subsequent flights without any notice. He had to then re-purchase all of these flights again so he could get home for $1300. This airline is a total rip off.<br>Our flight from Phom Penh to HCMC was cancelled with no notification. Luckily our hotels concierge was able to get an alternative flight with Qatar or we would have missed our connecting flight from HCMC to Melbourne, book another nights accomodation &amp; fly the next day. <br>Vietnam airline was uncontactable on a Sunday &amp; the guy at the transfer desk said this happens all the time.<br>My son should be recompensed by the airline as they have made money for 2 tickets for the same person, same flight without any permission or warning. <br>We would never fly with them again even though Vietnam is an excellent destination for holidays. I’d rather pay more for a reliable service that doesn’t rip you off."
449,bkdashbbsr,5,"Excellent interior, lovely crews, good food and comfortable seating and large leg space compared to others and price is low also. Being a national carrier everything has been taken care off. I will recommend others and like to repeat in my next visit."
449,Nate R,3,"SGN-REP<br>Business Class<br>Lotus lounge is very average, so if you've got a long stay at SGN Airport you'll probably head to the food court.<br>No meal service on board, adequate drink service, but the flight is hardly long enough to finish your drink."
449,Nickiwato,1,"Our flight was cancelled by Vietnam Airlines one week prior to our departure, we were offered a flight the following day early in the morning which wasn't ideal so we asked if we could fly the day prior to our original departure.  Vietnam Airlines could not get us on the flight the day prior so we then accepted the early morning flight as offered.  They then told us we could not get on that flight either and that we would now have to fly out around midday. We only had a short time in Phnom Penh and now we are unable to do the activities we had planned.  Very poor customer service, no empathy for our situation, we will not be flying with them again.  My husband also had to continually email and phone to get any sort of response.  2 days now until we depart and we still do not have tickets. Hope the service on the flight is better than what we have experienced so far"
449,Mackman70,5,This was one of three flights while in Vietnam we found the seats comfortable and Vietnam airlines staff both at the airport and on the aircrafts to be very friendly and the food was ok would recommend will definitely fly with them again
450,Aussiechick60,5,"I was apprehensive about booking business class with Vietnam Air due to the very mixed reviews. However a friend who had done the long haul Melbourne to London with VA twice in one year convinced us. And am really glad we did. For us the stop overs in HCM we’re definitely not an issue. We just factored them into our holiday schedule. And having travelled in Vietnam before it was an added pleasure. There are also hotels and transfers provided as part of the ticket. Everything went extremely smoothly from the express passes through Tullamarine security, flight departure, service on board, and lastly full length lie down capable seats. My only caveat would be the possible squeeziness if you are over 1.8m and of heavy build. But there were plenty of men of that description on our flight and they didn’t look perturbed. Food delicious too. Hosties extremely pleasant and attentive. In all highly recommended."
450,Songwl,4,"I had make a number of requests before the flight through email, and all the email were answered almost immediately, and action were taken to meet my request. They provide various types of vegetarian meals to cater for different groups of vegetarian. They pre-booked the seats for my family of 6, having us to sit together. On top of that, we got a very good offer price, almost half of the usual price when we booked the flight about 4 months before the departure."
450,Chris W,3,"An ok flight. Sat in the front row on flight there and back. Service was ok I give it a six, flight attendants just do the bare minimum. Little interaction with passengers just serving drinks and food and that’s it. Seat ok, I give it a six. There was no personal tv so entertainment was non-existent! Flight was just ok."
450,MikeB1966Sydney,4,"Brand new Airbus 787 dreamliner with a 3-3-3 configuration. Excellent leg room so you can easily stretch out. <br>Headrest TV with a good selection of English movies - not the latest films but enough that you should be able to find enough to watch - they also provide many different language films too hence the limited choice for English. <br>Food was good - the usual mini starter, main and desert with a bread roll. Most mains include rice or noodles with some meat in a sauce.<br>Wine was cheap french from the bottle but it was OK and was refilled if you wanted.<br>Overall an excellent flight"
450,531yvonneh,5,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines 4 times within 9 days throughout the country.  I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of leg room provided in economy class.  In addition, the flight attendants were friendly and professional and all 4 flights arrived on time!"
451,RowdyMelbourne,5,The third time i have flown with Vietnam airlines and wont be he last. The service from the moment you arrive at check-in until arrival is very good. The crew are very attentative to your needs and unlike some airlines do not hide when the lights are off but are available and walk up and down checking all is well.
451,Stephgstewart,4,Overall 8-10. Check in was very quick. Especially as we already had visas. We couldn’t choose seats already allocated for us. We were stuck right down the back second to last row. Our meals were ok if we got a choice. Were offered noodles as airline had run out of choice of meals by the time they got to us. Staff were not that friendly rarely smiled but helpful. No different to any other airline nothing special. Inflight entertainment was good. Plenty to choose from and games were good as well.
451,OD_Tour,3,"Should make early check in especially for domestic. Even you are arrive on time for check in, you can't get a seat for your flight. They was sold extra seat."
451,baccus60,4,"This was my first time flying with Vietnam Airlines. There were no delays during my departing and returning flights. Every was smooth and on time.<br>As soon as we took off, the stewardesses got on to distributing wet tissues. Then came the snacks(a packet of nuts) and drinks. Not long after that we got our meal, then coffee/tea. Meal onboard was OK - not great but not bad either. I've had worse with Cathay Pacific.  Most airlines serve chicken and beef but we got fish too on VA, another first for me. Staff were polite and efficient with surprisingly good English. It wasn't a full flight and the chief stewardess obliged me with my request for a seat change after the passenger beside me took off her shoes and almost killed me with her smelly feet! <br>A note on my pre-flight experience just after I booked my ticket. I had e-mailed VA over a slight problem. VA customer service responded within the day if I sent my e-mail in the morning of a working day. (They don't seem to work over the weekends though.) Overall,  I was pleased with their respond time and they did resolve my problem by forwarding my email to the correct department.<br>The reason I took a chance with Vietnam Airlines was because its flight times were a perfect fit with my travel itinerary. It offered lower fares for my trip to Japan, even lower than the low-cost carrier Air Asia. Best of all, it's a full-service flight. A 2-hour plus transit at Ho Chih Min or Hanoi was but a very small negative which I didn't find a problem at all. Also, I had signed up for its frequent flyer miles reward programme, LotusMiles, and because of that, I was given priority check-in!"
451,inter_dn,5,"I have business trip to Japan, and using Vietnam airlines to fly from DAD to NRT at 0h55am; start exactly time, procedure is faster; on the aircraft, everything are good, film and food so good;"
452,Alistairw1,5,Nice big Dreamliner from Melbourne.<br>Cabin Crew were awesome. Food was excellent. Great entertainment console.<br>Cannot fault this Airline. Used for the first time today!!!<br>Will use again!!
452,SENTHAO,4,"I only put one review for Vietnam Airlines though I traveled from Ha Noi to Saigon and back. Both ways, the service was amazing and I could see the service is tremendously improved.  The cabin, seats, in-flight entertainment, food and service all were excellent. The staff attitude has improved considerably.  I certainly will use Vietnam Airlines every possible occasion.  It is indeed a star airlines of the region."
452,Dan B,3,"On the 4th of June I look the direct flight from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City. All in all it was a great effortless flight. Although the inflight entertainment wasn’t great, there was a selection of films but only 2 or 3 new ones.<br>They ran out of on of the second meals too which wasn’t great.<br><br>The staff though as second to none, they’ll go out their way to do what they can."
452,guybrush,4,"I have always flied Vietnam Airlines during my annual visits to Vietnam, and have not looked back since.<br><br>Bottom line: VN is a 4-star airline, and its ease of booking, seats, meals and service as a whole shows as such.<br><br>Staff are as always gentle and helpful. Its booking website used to be faulty, but have improved a great deal in the last year. I don't have a great deal of experience flying with other companies, but I think its 30kg luggage allowance given its medium-low ticket pricing is impressive.<br><br>Downside: inflight refreshments and entertainment can do with more options, but these are minor complaints for a budget traveler like me."
452,sidneydavies2018,1,"Terrible, terrible experience with Vietnam Airlines. <br>Our flight to Ho Chi Minh City was scheduled to leave Melbourne on a Monday at 10:35AM. Around 10AM we were notified that their was a technical problem with the aircraft and that the engineers were working on the issue. Almost ever hour or so for the next 6 hours a similar announcement was made that they were working on the issue and hopefully would be able to board shortly. All that was given to us during this time was a $14 meal/drink voucher that could not even cover the price of one meal in the terminal. Eventually they informed us that the flight would be cancelled and that we would have to collect our baggage, go home and wait for a text that would tell us our new flight time for the following day. We received that text at 10PM that night saying our flight would be 6PM the following day, however after arriving at the airport yet again they informed us that the plane was not yet fixed and that they would attempt to put us on a flight the following afternoon. Poor, poor communication with customers and absolutely no care whatsoever!! Never heard of a flight being delayed for more than 48 hours with absolutely no compensation or alternate arrangements made for customers!!"
453,Hung Nguyen,4,"fresh meal on air, convenient wc, friendly staff, comfortable air plan, experienced pilot, accurate departure and landing time"
453,Annie W,4,"We are loving Vietnam Airlines, very happy with the service. Such friendly staff, each flight has been on time, food on International flight very good and nice cold drinks on domestic flights. Staff beautifully dressed, neat and tidy and always willing to help. Areas in the airports are clean as are the planes. They could clear our food trays away a bit quicker as they did sit there a long time after each meal on our International flight, but service was good if you needed anything extra."
453,bnjheuston,5,Travelled premium economy internationally and business for domestic.  There was <br>Plenty of space and the service was great. My husband needed a wheelchair at the airports and he was really well looked after.
453,Mac60371,5,"We had an amazing experience flying from Singapore to Hanoi. Staff were lovely, the plane was spotless and comfortable. Highly recommend"
453,BobH764,5,"We actually flew Premium economy but this option is not shown.  Very comfortable seat, good service and food. One of the best leg rooom seats with any airline seat."
454,fr_petrik,5,"Service level is higher then in Europe. In the fleet of aircraft's, there are very modern planes. I was surprised, that there are very new machines. If You have concerns about technical safety  in ""communist""   country, forget it."
454,George R,5,"Having flown with other well-known global airlines, I have to say Vietnam Airlines can match it with the best  for quality of service and food, and, comfort. Their competitive prices, together with the overall service, means I would happily fly with them again."
454,Mauricio P,4,"No problems with the flight, the most important no delays at all. Service was good, the line for registration a bit long since all flights go to the same line and security filters are a bit slow sometimes."
454,Teddy Duong,5,"I usually use Vietnam airline for my business trip. It's very comfortable with the chair and the atmosphere, clean and tidy, less noise from children and yelling from people.<br><br>However, it could be better if they could change the meal as something fresh instead of fast food like snack!<br><br>Will keep using this airline brand"
454,jimandronni1,4,"I have flown on Vietnam Airlines a number of times, they are punctual with there flights very helpful at the check in counter. The airlines are clean and the service and food enjoyable."
455,tieu112,1,"So my girlfriend and I was traveling from Cam Ranh to Bangkok for vacation and when we got our tickets there was a misspelling of my girlfriend's name (my mistake) so we got directed to the Vietnam Airline desk to get it corrected. The guy who ""helped"" us was completely useless. He began by scolding us and telling us that we're stupid for misspelling the name on the ticket, yes I made a mistake but that does not warrant anybody to talk down to us and degrade us. He scolded us for a good 5-7 min before I said what is the point of this, just help us fix the problem so we can be on our way. <br><br>Instead of fixing the spelling and issuing new tickets with the correct name (yes, I am aware there are fees for this, I didn't have any problem paying for it because it was my mistake), he HAND WROTE the name and crossed out the old name...we had a feeling that this was not gonna be good enough when we got to HCMC to transfer flights or to get us into Thailand but we went along with it because he continued to be so rude to us and we just wanted this interaction to be over with.<br><br>So we fly into HCMC and of course, they refuse to accept the tickets with a misspelling and a HAND WRITTEN correction. The Vietnam Airlines staff member begin to scold us there! Giving us attitude about why we didn't get this fixed at the departure point in Cam Ranh Airport. We explained to them that the guy refused to do it. So then the Vietnam Airline staff rudely sends us to another desk but it was the wrong desk so that desk sends us to another desk and only finally we were able to get someone to correct the name and issue new tickets, otherwise we would have never been able to get into Thailand.<br><br>FYI, my girlfriend and I are both Vietnamese and both live in Nha Trang but I hold an American passport. We both speak Vietnamese fluently so there was no issue of language barriers there. In my experience with Vietnam, government officials, companies like this, and police feel that they have authority to talk down and scold Vietnamese people and disregard any customer related service whatsoever. I'm sure if my girlfriend and I wasn't Vietnamese they wouldn't have treated us like this because they treat other guests with actual dignity.<br><br>It was one of the worse experiences I've ever had in flying, I will never spend any of my money with Vietnam Airlines again. Vietnam Airlines need to retrain their staff on their duties and customer service. It was completely incompetent and and unprofessional."
455,artherwebb,2,"This was a Virgin Holiday and arranged by them so that we could have direct flights. The plane was a little bit tired, it really needed refurbishment. The staff were ok but there were times when it was difficult to understand what was being said. The food was reasonable but the entertainment channels were absolutely rubbish. We were just glad to settle down and sleep. For anyone visiting Vietnam on holiday and taking internal flights be aware that 1) Flights can be cancelled at any time.2)  Flights can be delayed without information being given for why or how long. When we were returning home we had run through the airport to get to get our flight with only minutes to spare because the flight from Cambodia was so late due to several  cancellations we really thought we would miss our flight home. It was very worrying."
455,Hanh Van Pham,5,"Vietnam Airlines has always been my best choice for air travelling. All my flights with VNA, including 3 between Hanoi and London, are my wonderful experiences.<br><br>Today I took a 12hr flight from Hanoi to London. The whole flight was smooth with tiny shake. Food on flight, both Asian and European, was tasty. Various means of entertainment were offered and I really enjoyed good movies here. Flight attendances were friendly and responsible. Although I am Vietnamese, I pretended to be a foreigner and spoke everything with them in English (I often do so as a funny game), and I believe their English level is enough for communication.<br><br>Recently I also flew with Vietnam Airlines between Hanoi and Saigon. The service on those flights were not so impressive (since they were short flights), but more importantly, no delays occurred. VNA domestic flights are much less likely to be delayed than flights of others.<br><br>As a Vietnamese person, I warmly welcome people from all over the world to visit my beautiful country, and strongly recommend you guys to fly with Vietnam Airlines to have a more memorable trip."
455,BMellin1968,5,Truly second to none. I have flown many airlines and set Qantas the bench mark.<br>Vietnam airlines have done there homework and offer excellent service &amp; hospitality<br>on board there new fleet of aircraft. Great to see an airline caring about their passengers<br>not just profits what ever class you fly.
455,Cong PP,5,"I have 9hour with a supportive, friendly crew. The food and drink are ok. I strongly recommend you fly with VNA."
456,steve m,4,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines on several occasions and always found them very good and much cheaper than other airlines. Easy check in at HCM Airport, nice lounge. Friendly staff on the plane, good food and a nice choice of beers. Some of the planes are a bit old but all ok. Also not many delays."
456,SquizyTaylor,4,"We flew Vietnam Airlines for the first time. Besides being apprehensive due to price, normally you get what you pay for, we were presently surprised. The option is probably for the person with a little bit of extra time. we had an 8.5hr layover in Ho Chi Minh on the way over and 14hrs on return. there are options to do a tour through Vietnam Airlines or get a visa and plan your own. The plane was a dream liner on  both legs both ways. We have business class on return for less the 50% of the major airlines. so it is an excellant way to upgrade for an affordable budget. The staff were excellant, this make most experiences tollerable if not great.<br><br>all 4 travellers would be happy to try them again."
456,187147George,4,Not the warmest greeting when boarding but polite. The service is minimal for the short distance traveled. Not the most unpleasant flight I have ever had but I have been made to feel more welcome in the past!
456,Victor K,4,"Smooth and friendy, very smooth flight all the way with friendly host, just the aircraft is little too old."
456,johncraven2,3,excellent flight and good service out bound  but stewards not very helpful in bound. all other aspects good. Excelllent airplane.
457,maccasmrs,4,"Could not ask for a better service, quick to get on and off, and even though we were bused to the terminal it was very efficent, meals were lovely."
457,Donandalma@gmail.com,4,"Flew 4 legs SYD-HAN-LHR-SGN-SYD. All 787. All smooth &amp; on-time. Groundstaff great - very patient &amp; obliging. Crew very keen to please but limited English sometimes hampered clear communication (both personal &amp; announcements). Cabin crew felt perhaps like more task focussed than hospitality focussed. Meal menu quite limited &amp; slightly off-key fusion of asian &amp; euro cuisines. (Pho for breakfast v. good tho’.) No snacks. Flat beds compact but quite comfy. Good screens but not many english language movies, &amp; no TV shows. Prioity voucher worked well at airports. The Sky &amp; Lotus lounges at the ports are un-remarkable but offer modest food &amp; drink. If it all sounds a bit basic, that’s unfair because all the trip essentials are there for a fraction of the cost of Qantas or Singapore.  And our dawn to dusk stopover in saigon included free visas, a day room in 4 star hotel with pool, 3 meals in the restaurant, a mini-bus tour of the city and airport transfers. All paid by VA."
457,LloydNZ,2,Booked flight with China Airlines (CI9024) but was code shared on Vietnam Airlines VN578. Flying business class was a complete waste of money. Apart from wider seats and a bit more legroom that is all you got for the extra money. No personal entertainment screen. There were screens hanging from the ceiling but no headphones so were of no use apart from safety demonstration. The cabin crew were mostly invisible. I went to the toilet up front at one stage and they were all sitting on their jump seats reading magazines.
457,Tom Grassano,4,No frills but good service and relatively on time departure. The staff is very kind. I was impressed with check in at the Hue airport. The lady was very helpful. Vietnam Airlines is a dependable airline. No frills but good service.
457,Sagitaur,3,"I was booked on a midday flight from Hanoi to Danang, on a Saturday.  I received advance notice (via text, e-mail, and phone call) over 12 hours in advance that my flight would be delayed by nearly 2 hours (13.50 etd).  This was a bit inconvenient, as I needed to get home as I had guests arriving to watch some rugby!<br>I spent a couple of hours in the Vietnam Airlines Golden Lotus lounge, which is always pleasant at Noi Bai.  This enabled me to catch up on some work, so not a major issue.  However, when the flight was further delayed to 14.25 I was getting a bit fidgety.<br>Anyone, boarding was called, and to my surprise, I was given an upgrade to Business Class (at the gate).<br>Apart from a little more legroom and a newspaper you cannot really savour any difference on a 1 hour flight on A321."
458,Andowhite,3,Airline got off to a good start boarding on time. ... food pretty standard .... nothing special at all .... staff friendly but full plane they were under the pump ... coming home different story .. flight from nha trang an hour delay then flight from ho chi mein city another hour delay ... took us 24 hrs with delays to get home ... service was not fantastic on way home either .... food very poor on home flight ..
458,Hiho_Sydney,4,"The direct Sydney - Hanoi flight is so much more convenient, no stopping over in HCMC and no waiting for connecting flight."
458,vic m,3,This will actually make a good premier budget flight. As the service is all average and flight is cheap but is way better than a budget flight. Entertainement need major upgrade but seats are good
458,Don Wright,3,"40 minute delay, otherwise the flight was okay and the seats comfortable. Just a glass of water on the way."
458,Ann H,4,"Very friendly and helpful staff, clean aircraft and enough onscreen entertainment for a 9 hour flight. Our internal afternoon  flight between Hue and Hanoi had its time changed to a later take off time 3 times. After speaking to airline staff we were able to change to the morning flight at no additional cost, well done Vietnam Airlines. One minor issue on the flight from Sydney to Hanoi was the timing of the meals, it was about 7 hours between the meals and when we asked for a snack we were told they did not have any."
459,Jo S,4,"My husband upgraded us to Business class as a surprise and I am sooooo glad he did. Plenty of leg room, comfy seats and good cabin service. Pity the flight was only just on an hour!! We were able to make use of the Lotus Lounge and this was very good going to Nha Trang from Ho Chi  Minh City - but rather average from Nha Trang airport back.<br>It would have been nice to have Priority boarding as this is what travelling Business is all about but both legs of the journey it was a bit of a free for all!"
459,Wanderlust_daya,5,"We flew Vietnam airlines twice while we were in Vietnam. Both times the flights were on time, check in was easy and the flights were smooth. The staff was efficient and friendly. The aircraft was spotless and so clean!"
459,101holiday lover,4,"OK we have our itinerary.  Checking in at Da Nang airport as per the Internet schedule for Vietnam Airlines and our itinerary. <br><br>As we check in our luggage we are advised that we have been moved to a different flight and it leaves in 20 mins, so we need to hurry.<br><br>This is not the first time and it annoys me as if our hotel transfer was late we would have missed our flight as they had put us on a earlier flight by 1 hour.<br><br>Must be a better way to find out if your flight has changed.  <br><br>Otherwise good legroom, in flight entertainment, food you can eat.  Toilets not so clean after 1 hour into flight."
459,Lydia M,1,Had a booking with Vietnam Airlines  on the 15th June 2018 to fly to Phu quoc at 1pm. We were at airport by 9am as we had caught an earlier flight from Nha Trang.  So we waited at Airport.. by 11 am we went to book in only to find the plane was delayed until 3.30pm.. Right.. then they changed it again to 3.55pm.. by this time people were asking whats going on.. so much so that then they changed the gate number.. by this time its 4.30pm and we boarded the plane at 4.45pm.. didnt get to Phu Quoc until after 6pm.. there was no communication to the passagers as to why such a long delay. It was terrible and i certainly wont be flying ever again with Vietnam Airlines.. And to think that i could have gotten a cheaper flight with vietjet but thought i would treat myself.
459,Lisa B,2,"We arrived 3 hours before our flight and there was no queue - check in was a breeze. <br>Economy is not called cattle class without good reason. The service was basic- food tasted good but the small touches just aren’t there- maybe it’s a cultural thing. I was fortunate enough to be the one out of a party of 4 to have an aisle to myself which gave us some room once we were settled. While we shouldn’t expect everyone to have a grasp of English - some of the social niceties wouldn’t have gone astray- we were tired and hungry, our plane had been delayed by approx 45 minutes so when we finally boarded at 10pm it would have been nice for someone to at least smile and say hello - that didn’t happen. Basically the only interaction we had with staff was when they presented us food - that was it. I said thank you when getting off, a smile and nod of the head. If you are after a budget conscious Vietnam Airlines is for you if you are after even a little service (smiles don’t cost anything) then look elsewhere."
460,Ilker A,1,"We flew with Vietnam airlines from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi to Denang to Dalat back to Ho Chi Minh City.  Each flight was delay by more than an hour and twice over two hours.  Vietnam airlines staff were unhelpful with each delay.<br><br>I would NOT recommend Vietnam airlines, if you can find an alternative choose it."
460,janellereynolds4,4,"First time flight with Vietnam Airlines from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh.  New Dreamliner plane which was very quiet and clean and I must admit that I did not feel as jet lagged as I do on other flights of this length to/ from Asia.  Movie selection was quite good as there were a couple of new releases that I managed to view and pass the time with.  Seat width was ok and the leg room seemed to be comfortable enough.  Meal and drink service ok, probably could improve on that but I never expect too much in the way of food quality &amp; taste whilst in the air.  Overall a pleasant flight and would certainly fly them again."
460,Melinda D,5,"We have been flying Vietnam airline to Europe for our yearly trip for several years now. The service, planes staff and meals on board are all excellent.<br>Also the flight times are very good . My husband and I would not fly with anyone else considering the cost of the tickets with the service provided ."
460,brownize,5,"Since we had Electronic Visas, we had to fly from Bangkok to Saigon and then on to Dalat as that was the closest point of entry that accepted the electronic visas. It was a great flight and we were very impressed with the service! Everyone from check in to flight crew were so pleasant and smiling!  It is really interesting to see the difference between airlines/personnel in Asia versus North America!"
460,Nattakrit T,2,"Could have done better dealing with customers, front of me having 3 kids abd the parents just let them sang for 12 hours straight. I politely asked the cabin crew to solve this problem and he said that he cannot do anything as they came with many people. Thank you, while I said back that although they have 3 to 5 people but remains aisle passengers had same trouble as me. If you can handle this well, I would rate 5 stars but after confronting this unprofessional manners 2 stars are even good for you guys."
461,Timm,3,Vietnam airline could be one of the top asian airlines but they can not fulfill a scheduled flight plan. Out 3 Flights 100% were delayed.<br><br>So dont book if you want to travel on time.
461,Hannah P,5,"We ended up using vietnam airlines for 3 flights while travelling in vietnam... Nha Trang to Da Nang, Da Nang to Hanoi, Hanoi to Hong Kong.<br>They were such a pleasure to fly with after using the dissappointing vietjet air.<br>Considering these 2 airlines charge roughly the same amount (few pounds difference) its crazy the difference in quality. To give you a comparison:<br>Vietjet air looks cheaper at first glance on the website but once you put in your details they add a ton of taxes, charge to include a bag and have no meal or entertainment. The chairs are small and uncomfortable.<br>The contrast is that vietnam airlines has no hidden charges, the price you see is the price you pay ( with a small tax addition which they make clear on the first page), they include a check in bag free of charge, include a meal free of charge and the seats are far more spacious and comfortable.<br>Neither have entertainment but thats ok as the flights are generally an hour or two.<br>They were on time, bags came through quickly and the whole process was very smooth.<br>Would definitely recommend vietnam airlines!"
461,Chriso17,3,"A short efficient flight, with no complaints. Staff friendly and aircraft clean. No inflight entertainment but not missed."
461,RoyOz2016,5,"First time flying with this airline. I was pleasantly surprised with our flights to and from Hong Kong. Schedules were on time, seats were comfortable and the in flight service was very good. My ticket stated refreshments would be served on our short flight and we were offered a full meal."
461,Vasita S,4,very economical to fly from one destination to another than traveling in a vehicle. recommend you use this method for quick and convenient travel as a visitor.
462,David K,4,"Boarding in China always a nightmare, the aircraft was packed at the very end of the airport and needed a bus to get to it (usually in Shanghai business class passengers are transported in a car to the plane) which was over packed. <br><br>The A321 aircraft was old and dated, the crew were nice and the food was fine. The seat was an old style seat which didn't allow to sleep. Arriving in Ho Chi Min was fine, transfer and lounge was good.<br><br>The 787 business class is good for 8 hours to Sydney, however i wouldn't want to go any further in it. Seats are flatbed but not comfortable for sleeping well. The food was very Asian which is rare on a flight to Sydney. On arrival at Sydney, everyone was put on the same bus again which was incredibly crowded and then dumped at immigration.<br><br>I think they have a long way to go to be a real contender for Business Class Long haul travel, but its getting there."
462,Vivian Tran,5,I took the flight from Hanoi and it carried us on a Dreamliner with a comfortable seat and various entertainment programs. Air crew was helpful and professional. Recommend to choose Vietnamairlines for traveling within Vietnam.
462,Claes W,4,No frills airline operating timely and with proffesional attitude and performance.<br>Crew performance is as expected and inflight service up to standard.
462,LASeoulGuy,3,"My wife and I had three flights on Vietnam Airlines during our vacation last week. All three flights were delayed 25-30 minutes and all flights still arrived on time which was pretty surprising. VN414 on June 9. 2018 had average food but VN170 was pretty good. The main flight attendant on VN170 that took care of my seat (33E) was nice but the others were all frowning and not very kind. The ground staff was okay for all three flights but again, not amazing."
462,Leesey71,4,"We took Vietnam airlines simply because they offer a direct flight from Hanoi to Sydney. Staff are great, facilities great but the food was very average"
463,abrahamsonpeter,4,The new generation jets ( Dreamliner from Sydney to HCM City and A350 to Frankfurt) added to the excellent service and great food making this lengthy journey more than bearable. A seven hour layover in Vietnam was spent in a four star hotel providing a room for showers and rest  and a meal in the restaurant all included in the price of the ticket. Whilst getting an entry visa at HCM City Airport was a bit of a hassle the break in the long journey was appreciated. Whilst this airline does not provide some of the frills like pajamas and extensive wine and movie lists it’s an excellent way to fly from Australia to Europe.
463,karikoivunen22,4,Good service and decent and quiet experience. They know things very well. :)There was a safe feeling on the flight and good meals and drinks too.The staff were brisk and stylish and friendly.
463,Karen P,5,"The flight was comfy, nice attentive staff and we took off on time, only bad thing they left a suitcase in London, but with all haste they found it and delivered to our hotel very good is service, good entertainment was also available,"
463,Marco f,5,We recently flew direct Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City and back to Melbourne with Vietnam Airline it was a great experience overall will use them again when traveling back to Vietnam
463,chinwP,2,"Although it is just around HKD200 to upgrade to business class from economy, it is totally not worth. Before departure, I have visited the lounge. In the lounge, there is just some food which is not tasty. The environment is not very clean, food residue was discovered on the sit.<br><br>In the flight, there is only welcome drink and one additional drink during the flight. No food provided. <br><br>The cabin seems old, there is not TV.<br><br>I will rather choose LCC next time."
464,Stephen P,4,"I am 6""2 and normally pay for exit row seating to give myself the legroom that allows me to relax. On our recent trip Vietnam Airlines plane gave me more than adequate legroom and we were lucky enough to only have 2 in a bank of 3 seats. Staff were pleasant and courteous and food again was pleasant."
464,harrylistokin,2,Very Poor service and all we were given for the entire trip was a cup of water<br>The staff appeared bored and not interested in engaging with passengers
464,christopherU2874FO,1,"Been flying for business trips for the last 20yrs of my life and have to say this is by far the lowest value for money i have ever paid. They charge an extortionate amount of money and the service is so poor. Thwy advertise inflight entertainment yet you are forced to watch some ridiculous shows about golf or football or some candid camera. In todays flight they served a horrible bun which was obviously spoiled bread. See pics. Seriously Vietnam Airlines if you are reading this, you need to start thinking about adding value to the flight experience and not simply looking to have more money in your pockets."
464,Ricardo N,1,"The worst flight experience ever!<br><br>We had a flight on May 5th from Da Nang to Hanoi to connect to our international flights. We have booked to 1415 arriving in Hanoi at 1535. Two days before the flight was suddenly changed to 1445 arriving Hanoi at 1605. We still had 3h to our next flight. Everything has changed (and the nightmare started!!) when the flight was diverted to Haiphong supposedly due to ""weather conditions and operational reason of the airport"" (ONLY FOR VIETNAM AIRLINES since all the other companies have landed! Was it inexperience of the pilots onboard?! I really hope not!! ). After landed in Haiphong, nobody knew what was going to happen, passengers kept with no information, the only thing that was said all time was ""sorry for the inconvenience""!<br><br>After that we took off again going back to Hanoi arriving at 1854 (2h54min delayed) and off course that our flight to Singapore had already took off (it looks like there was bad weather only for Vietnam Airlines).&nbsp;<br><br>Since that moment we have experienced the worst costumer support ever! Basically they don't care about the situation that they put you into! It's you who have to fix everything and get a solution!<br><br>For us, absolutely a company to avoid since you can't trust them!"
464,Gipsy,4,"I love getting comfy in my seat.  Then the cabin crew bring our slippers, refresher towel and headphones.  I’ve flown with more “expensive” airlines and I’ve flown with “budget” airlines. Both were disappointing!  Vietnam Airlines is just right!"
465,Esther B,5,My first time on this airline. Great service. Departure and landing very smoothe and on time. Good meals and comfortable seats. I used the option to buy (if available) the seat between the two of us for $50 aud each way. Well worth it. Would highly recommend this airline.
465,David R,4,We recently flew direct from Sydney to Saigon and can’t praise Vietnam Airlines enough.  It was a great experience from the time we checked in to the time we disembarked.  There was ample food and drink and the cabin crew were very polite and helpful
465,Maxine S,4,"I would class the journey out from Heathrow to Hanoi as excellent in every respect. The staff were friendly and courteous. We were constantly supplied with wipes, drinks, water, snacks, and good quality food.  The in-flight entertainment was substantial to cover all tastes and we were supplied with blankets, pillows, slippers, toothpaste, toothbrush and head phones.  All this for no extra cost on the flight.  The reason I stated 'very good' however is that on our return journey, there was far less attention but we were flying through the night and I believe they just left us to sleep as they even changed the windows from clear to dark purple so that as the sun came up, we weren't dazzled by light.  We would definitely fly with this airline again without hesitation."
465,Sue M,4,Very pleased with the service on Vietnam Airlines. Have flown with them on two holidays and would recommend them when flying to Vietnam from Australia.
465,Peter G,3,"Poor check-in, especially seat allocation, despite discussion, obtained poor seats and separated from partner despite a lot of passengers yet to be checked.  Good movie and most else average"
466,Peter G,3,"Average in most respects.  No real problems or deficiencies.  Nothing great either.  Food good, wide range of movies."
466,Johnnyblueb,4,"Very good value Business Class fare. Good planes, friendly service &amp; food mostly high standard. Comfortable flat bed &amp; flights on time. Only problem was the long transit time between connecting flights to &amp; from Paris but lounge comfortable &amp; able to have a shower &amp; relax. Recommended."
466,John I,3,Vietnam Airlines is a nice average carrier providing good service. It’s not cheap but it’s ok for a short trip. Business class was just ok nothing exceptional.
466,Marilyn W,5,"I first flew business class from Sydney to London with Vietnam Airlines because they were so much cheaper than any of their competitors. I have now flown with them for three years in a row for that reason but also because I believe them to be at least as good as most of the competitors. They have modern Boeing 787s with fully flat beds, the service is excellent and a good selection of food, nicely presented. The toilets are just normal sized but kept clean. There is a six-hour stopover in Ho <br>Chi Minh City, where you can take advantage of either a personally guided city tour or be taken to a hotel room for that time. (On my first trip I paid $30 and did a guided tour for a couple of hours AND then went to the hotel to have a rest, shower and change for the rest of the time.) This year I decided to have an overnight stay in HCMC (which I love visiting) and will always do that in future as I was able to exercise, sleep and relax before the next leg. I have also done the flight via Hanoi, which is also an great city to visit."
466,Katherine C,4,"My husband &amp; I flew VA after our travel agent booked us with them. We were a bit hesitant after reading a lot of negative reviews. We flew Sydney to Vietnam return. Honestly I cannot say enough how great these flights were. Having flown international regularly, we packed out travel pillows warm jackets, socks &amp; a wrap for me. No need pillows &amp; blankets on every seat, the flight attendants handed out a small travel pack to everyone which had disposable slippers, toothbrush &amp; toothpaste. In the toilet they had toiletries available to freshen up. Once everyone was on board you were able to move to vacant seats. My husband &amp; I had a 3 seat row to ourselves so both were able to have a sleep. The in flight entertainment was great. My screen did glitch out a couple of times but it came back on after less then a minute. (Tip-save any movie you are going to watch into favourites &amp; if it drops out it will start at the same spot you left off) Meals were fine, they are airline meals, you know what you are getting. But they certainly fed you a lot. The attendants were friendly, helpful &amp; accommodating when they could be. For the people complaining about their lack of English, this is Vietnam Airlines not Australian airlines. There was a mum with a toddler &amp; small baby in front of us, once the seatbelt sign was off the attendants came straight over hooked a small bassinet into the wall &amp; made up a bed for the baby. Mum &amp; baby had a restful stress free flight. Brilliant!! I would fly VA any time I got the chance from now on."
467,Dominick1984,4,"This is a good airline — thoroughly professional and competent in all areas.<br>It’s hard to criticise anything — although I wasn’t particularly keen in the food choices, but that’s not a major issue. I am very tall, and would have liked more legroom, but that’s the same everywhere.<br>The staff were really helpful and considerate."
467,Karliooze,5,"I had return flight Frankfurt-Saigon-Frankfurt with Vietnam airlines. It was the best experience from the checkin to the cabin staff. Nice food, very good service, always clean bathroom. And of course brand new Dreamliners on the fleet."
467,Tony V,2,We only used VN airlines because we didn't have many options flying between VN and Japan.  Round trip tickets cost more than my flight from LAX to HCMC!  Mostly average on things however the section where we were located air conditioning was not working.  It was really hot and we complained to the flight staff a few times.  Not sure if they turned off the A/C to save fuel or it was broken but it took them a few hours to fix.  The plane seemed out dated compare to other airlines.  Will definitely explore other options next time.
467,DrByte0001,5,"I recently decided to give Vietnam Airlines a try for my trips to Hanoi. The staff and amenities were great and as expected. The Sky Team lounge offered the standard services and food you would get in most lounges but had no comparison to a 1st class lounge. <br><br>All in all it was a good choice. With business class you get your boarding passes stamped as Sky Priority, which give you the Sky Priority lane at the Vietnam customs, which is a much shorter line."
467,Steve S,2,"Economy flights are never going to be an exhilarating experience I'm sure we can all agree.<br>My recent flight on Vietnam Airlines from HCMC to Sydney was certainly no exception, but I have to say that the absolute miserable demeanor of the flight staff on my last Vietnam airlines flight did nothing to lessen the torture of a 8.5 HR night flight, also the in-flight food served was among the worst I have ever had to endure.<br>The flight wasn't even full and they hadn't enough bottled water, disgraceful.<br>That was my last flight ever with Vietnam airlines.<br>We also flew business class on the the way over to HCMC from Sydney and the food and service was equally as bad!"
468,Anthony Devitt,5,"Actually this was a Premium Economy flight but there is no dropdown for this in the 'Class of Service' box here.  Right here's the low down. You wouldn't ordinarily think that Sydney Via Vietnam was a logical route but if you are on holidays it's brilliant and the service offered by Vietnam Airlines is fantastic. Here's the low down in bullet point form and you can assess if its for you.<br>1. Premium Economy in Vietnam airlines is like the old business class seats. I am 6ft 1"" and I had HEAPS of room in a lovely seat with all the personal entertainment gizmos you could ask for. <br>2. IT was superb value at a shade over 1200.00 Return, YES RETURN in premium economy.<br>3. Brilliant flight times. Left morning and arrived morning and had an overnight sleep on a journey that lasted about ummmmm30 hours on the way out and 22 on the way back.<br>4. Here's the kicker - a 15 hour layover in HCM City on the way out. BUT in premium economy, they take you from the airport, get your visa sorted, put you in a hotel (A better one if you are in business class) and then give you a free exclusive Mini-bus tour of the city. Free Gratis Included ....even including some food at the hotel. Then they collect you and bring you back to the airport. If you want a mini adventure to start your holiday then this is just fantastic. We could walk around HCM for a few hours, do the fascinating highlights tour, then grab a snooze before the final leg of the trip. It's a fascinating city and you get to walk around all the important sights on this little tour with your own guide.<br>5. Flights on a 787-9 are fantastic. We arrived at the end of both legs feeling rested.<br>6. On board food is fine and entertainment is easily up with any other airline. The aircraft are spotless and of course Very new.<br>7. Very friendly staff. Free and easy service of anything you wanted during the flight.<br>8. Premium Economy ( and remember its not that much more than normal economy..... why am I telling you this, I should keep the secret to myself)  gives you priority check-in, boarding, deplaning, priority bags and enough KG allowance to bring the kitchen sink if you can't be away from it for a few weeks.<br>I had a peak in normal economy and that looked nice too. It was 2 4 2 in Premium and 3 4 3 in Economy. <br>I would undoubtedly fly with Vietnam Airline again. Their Premium Economy seat may be the old style business class seat but it's a damn site better than some of those new 'Pod' seats that I have been in recently. ANA have the same or very similar in their 787."
468,Msbelfast,5,"Had two flights with Vietnam Airlines in business class. From start to finish it was quality. Clean planes, excellent service and good food. Highly recommended and the lounge is very good. Comfortable seats with plenty of room to relax."
468,Olaf M,4,We are pleased with Vietnam Airlines.  Flight was on time and staff is very helpful. Checkin and boarding was easy. Will fly again.
468,Olaf M,5,We enjoyed Vietnam Airlines. Checkin and boarding was very easy. Staff was helpful and accommodating. On time and uneventful. Will fly again
468,Melbguy3805,5,Plane was a little old but seeing the route that was fair enough. The flight was good. Meal was fine. Seat size was great. Getting priority baggage and priority immigration was a bonus. Overall a good flight.
469,Nguyen L,5,"The service is quick. Comfortable seat but no private TV and multilmedia. Staff are nice, good outlook and responsive."
469,Rod C,5,"This is a relatively new Business Class option and Vietnam Airlines are going out of their way to win market share with new planes, excellent on board service, good food and wines. You are treated like royality - and the price is right.  Much cheaper than the next closest offering."
469,TabiNotto,5,This trip was my first time with Vietnam Airlines and for sure it won't be the last time :) We checked in online the day before our flights so it was very convenient to choose where to sit and just drop our luggage at the airport. <br><br>We flew from Bangkok to Osaka with a transfer in Hanoi. The flights were smooth both taking off and landing. There were few turbulence but not a big deal. Food were very nice in every flights. Seats were comfortable but the screen control on armrest annoyed me from time to time. The passenger next to me always put her arm on the armrest and accidentally turned on my reading light and rewound my movie.
469,Annette B,5,"For economy class flight this airline is doing it right.  Daytime flight which included lunch and dinner.  Food good, service excellent, drinks available - great choice and offered regularly.    Night Flight Home was also a good experience.   Had to ask for air-conditioning to be turned on.   Would highly recommend for good service at an economy price."
469,Rita L,5,"A great experience. Comfortable and clean seating area, good food and service. We experienced the same quality experience on our return flight also."
470,jenwild,4,"We had a pleasant flight, it was lunch time so we had a reasonable lunch served, the aircon was not very cool though so it got a bit hot, even when the air vents were on full. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg room, I am only 164 cm so realistically I fit in most seats but my husband is 190 cm so he sometimes has an issue, but not this time."
470,peter c,5,A great flight from HCMC. Like all airlines there are a few hiccups with the timing.!!  Good seats and food and arrived feeling good.
470,Andrew M,5,"Vietnam Airlines direct was a pleasure! Great service, staff fantastic and service second to none. After travelling with various airlines to Vietnam over the last few years this has to have been the best experience. No layover - having travelled via the Middle East several times and China the direct route is best!! Food on the flight was good as was the beverage service - we chose a flight into Saigon and flew out of Hanoi - allowing us to travel from south to north - a cost of £480 return. Advise booking in advance for the best price!!!"
470,scubacol11,4,"Check in smooth and efficient,boarding fine although not always easy to work out P.A. announcements.Once on the plane lots of room in overhead lockers for luggage,plenty of leg room and seat very comfy,did not use on demand entertainment system as I try to sleep a lot on long haul,food surprisingly good quality and choice.Only negative was all the announcements were very quiet and hard to hear and work out,apart from that would certainly fly with them again."
470,Henry P,4,Flying Vietnam Airlines the beginning to a holiday of a lifetime. Efficient early checkin; friendly On-board staff; quiet efficient airplane with plenty of leg room - some extra leg-room available if asked for. Food was alright for airline food. In flight entertainment was available with plenty of choice. Would certainly fly this airline again.
471,Allen L,4,"Friendly staff, departed on time. Leg room is reasonable for long legs. Minimal service available in flight. Fairly new aircraft."
471,Chris Y,4,"The first of 7 flights with Vietnam Airlines over a two week period. A couple in relatively new 787. Staff all very courteous, well presented and friendly. Flights seldom delayed by more than a few minutes and arrivals on-time, even during one bad weather flight. No flights in aircraft older than 6 years (all Airbus 321's). Ground staff also very friendly and did their best for seating our party together. Only issues at Saigon where there was a late gate change and the aircraft had been on the tarmac for sometime and the air-con went into overdrive creating a cloudy welcome when boarding. the 787 flights were premium economy with extra legroom and nicer seats as these flights were over eleven hours duration."
471,Danny L,4,"After flying with Vietnam airlines we had our faith restored in Vietnam domestic flights. Do not fly with Vietjet (check my reviews on them) but Vietnam airlines is professional, safe, good service and even a simple free drink during the one hour flight. The flight was on time which was very important to us. We did have this flight booked with a different airliner (Vietjet) but we didn’t trust them so purchased flights with Vietnam airlines and so glad we did ((Vietjet delayed as usual and we would’ve missed our main connecting flight). Highly recommend Vietnam airlines in Vietnam."
471,Lalit Surjan,5,"I had originally booke in economy class but chose to upgrade as I was tired after a long haul. I was pleasantly surprised to note that it was not very costly. The ground staff was most efficient and courteous.The lounge service was par excellence. On-board experience too, was very comfortable. My thanks to ticketing staff on 19th May early afternoon who attended me for her helpful ways."
471,Tragedy65,3,"This is the first time I see passengers being allowed to go to the toilets even though the plane was taxi-ing out to the runway without any flight attendants stopping them!  The seat belts were not long enough and I had to ask for extensions (but also because of my size).<br><br>The most tedious part of this trip was that they could not connect both my flights, so I had to collect my luggage and walk out to a different terminal to check in for my next flight, and both International and Domestic Terminals were packed."
472,Zoe C,4,"We flew Vietnam Airlines  from Syd to Saigon. Then Saigon to Danang. The customer  service was great they were only too happy to help with anything. Especially good considering we had a connecting flight . Seats on plane were comfortable and everything nice and clean.  Food was pretty good .Alot better than most airlines we have flown. (Jetstar, Fiji Airways and Virgin).In flight entertainment was good.  Good variety of movies. Only thing i would suggest is childrens meals.  Our 8 year old daughter was not fond of the food. Not really suitable for kids pallets.  But all in all a good experience will definantly fly with them again."
472,Nemocras,5,"This is not the most luxurious flight, but probably thre best value for money on long haul business class flights. Food is OK, but no more."
472,888jacquelyn,4,We had very good service on our flights with Vietnam Airlines even thought the flight was pretty full. Selection of movies and tv shows was good. Staff were very pleasant.'<br>NO screaming children.
472,Oz Traveller,2,My main concern around this flight was safety. The plane was extremely old which doesn’t make it unsafe but doesn’t give you confidence.  Mainly I was concerned with the attitude of the flight attendants. The head flight attendant was drinking a drink during take off. Casually sipping away during what I thought was the most important part of their job. No one checked seat belts. It was all very relaxed. Unsure if I’m an emergency they would be any use. <br><br>In general plane was old and uncomfortable. Food was average at best and airport lounges weren’t worth going to. Very disappointing experience.
472,Alison B,3,Very long time between refreshments <br>Especially when traveling with children <br>When asked for extra the portion was small and the wait was too long
473,Craig M,4,"Nice airline, checking staff were exceptional, professional and helpful. Aircraft was a 'new' Dreamliner, great plane. Service and food was very good, the staff were o k but need training in customer communication. Plenty of interaction with 'Asian ' passengers but very reserved with others.<br>In comparison, Garuda Airlines are the opposite, but in fairness, they have been around a lot longer and are used to flying to and from Australia. Nevertheless, I would still fly with Vietnam Airlines in the future."
473,fery12022000,4,"Truly enjoyed flying Airbus 321 Vietnam Airlines even without adjustable video screen on the seat.  Indeed, we must watch video display which come up from the cabin ceilling. No private display for each passenger.  Air crews was friendly and cabin was clean, so I could sleep comfortably. Just small advice to the ground staff in the Ho Chi Minh airport, my stop over airport before flying to Da Nang that they should assist passenger who never had been transfered flight International to Domestic particularly to find the way to the domestic terminal or any fast track for transit/transfer passenger.  'Transit' paper sticker didn't work, just let you know."
473,Mr. Fabulous,5,"I did not know what to expect from this airline but it was so fabulous, the staff, the seating the amenities, I loved it and happy I choose this airline."
473,whmwhite,5,"First time flying with Vietnam Airlines and wakened up fresh the next morning after a very good flight. Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful throughout. Seats were comfortable and the Dreamliner a well designed plane. Could do with a USB socket at the seat but all in all I will fly VA again."
473,Ajgconc,4,"Congratulations Vietnam Airlines.  We flew with you 2 years ago.  The plane was old, toilets out of order. (They had signs on them- to Vietnam and on our return- different planes as different toilets out of order). , <br>Flew with you this time.  Modern plane, better choice of movies, clean and all toilets working.  Staff were amazing (same as last trip).  A wonderful improvement.  I will definitely fly with them again."
474,BangkokAndy1976,3,The staff are friendly and polite although being given a Pepsi rather than the Coke Zero I asked for smacks of laziness. The other server had a bottle. The seats have plenty of legroom but are really uncomfortable and anything more than 2 hours would be painful. The website is easy to navigate.
474,Schowdy,4,Nice clean well run economy airline.  Their web site could use some cleaning up as it is hard to navigate.  Some reservation steps aren't logical.  But I managed to book a round trip flight Bangkok to Ho chi Minh City for $180 US all in.  That's pretty good as flying in and out of Bangkok Suvarnabh his quite expensive. Check in was quick and bag claim was quick as well.  Since I had visa in hand at the airport I whizzed right through immigration.
474,Toni S,5,"I was hospitalised in Ho Chi Min with bacteria and couldn’t fly on my original Qantas/Emirates First Class flight I booked with Qantas points. When my husband rang Qantas, they were beyond rude and unhelpful, no empathy whatsoever to assist with our situation. My husband was left to search for a new return flight home. He looked at Qantas, Emirates, Singapore Air, all via Singapore, none were direct to Melbourne. I had to lie down as I was still very ill so he had to bite the bullet and pay for business class. Vietnam Air was the only airline that flew direct and its cost was half or less than half than all the other airlines. Even though cost was not the objective in getting me home, he chose vietnam Air for 2 reasons. 1 flew with them domestically and was great, 2 they flew direct to Melb and wanted to get me home quick for medical care.  Was at first weary of flying an Asian airline due to the incidents we have heard about but I can’t express with enough emphasis how great they were. Safe and smooth , friendly and kind, can’t say anything about the food since I couldn’t eat! But my husbands food looked good. The business seats were comfy and private, fully flat bed. The tv screens were larger than qantas. On time! They were great and we wouldn’t hesitate to fly with them again. And shame on Qantas for not standing up to their motto “feels like home”. It felt nothing like home to me when they made no effort to assist my husband. Congratulations Vietnam Airlines for standing out from all the bigger airlines. Keep up the good work!"
474,chamberswalker,5,Flying from Phnom Penh always means a stopover or 2 which led me to try the Vietnam Airlines route. Very glad I did - both planes were exceptionally clean and well maintained; service impeccable; on time; seats very comfortable (Airbus 321 and 350 respectively). <br>Would def rate them as a top tier airline.
474,samantha d,4,Decent airline. Has more leg room than most domestic airlines. Would prefer this than air asia for long haul. They at least have TV and meals.
475,terry s,4,"I have been a decades long frequent traveller with Singap[ore Air and rate them highly. Availability problems left me travelling with Vietnam Air. <br>The draft was a ( seemingly by the condition) brand new ‘Dreamliner’. I was on my first economy flight ( having recently retired from corporately financed travel and “ expected the worst”.<br>However I was most pleasantly surprised at the service levels, the condition of the aircraft, the interaction my the crew and all those things that make a flight a torture or a pleasure.<br>The economy seat was big enough for my 1.8m and 82kg body and the right level of softness and support.<br>I would certainly do this trip again with them."
475,Николай Г,4,"It was very good experience! The aircraft was Boeng-787. The seat was very comfortable and the level of service was very decent. Meals was okay, but still I think there is a room for improvements.<br>Entertaiment was not quite well, as it was only on Vietnamese and English (no Russian) and no Wi-Fi onboard."
475,AJ O'Grady,5,"Vietnam Airlines ticked all the boxes for my wife and I. We were not expecting the quality and professionalism that was given to us. The planes were new, comfortable,clean and roomy. The service was friendly and professional. The food and beverages were of a high standard and the in flight entertainment was excellent. All round a wonderful experience . We are very much looking forward to our next flights with Vietnam Airlines. Excellent."
475,kumarpanks,4,"I am a frequent flyer of Vietnam Airlines since last 2 years due to business travel needs and always find them good. New aeroplanes, ample leg room, nice clean cabin, good on time peroformance, attentive staff, competitive pricing, etc. I would highly recommend Vietnam Airlines for both domestic and International destinations.<br>But, they still need to upgrade themeselves to be at par some of the top class airlines available in south east asian region. <br>Their staffs (both ground service &amp; cabin) are attentive and professional, but, lacking that welcoming smile on their face. A welcoming smile makes a huge difference in passanger's opinion about airline.<br><br>They have excellent in-flight entertainment available in their B787 &amp; A359, but, unfortunately (and for some unknown reason) they won't let passangers use them in their domestic flights. They will mandatorily play advertisements and boring documentaries even if no one is watching it. This seems so funny to understand why they would do that and keep boring their passangers throughout the flight.<br>Their choice of food in domestic routes does not change. They been serving same food ever since I am flying them :)<br><br>Otherwise they are an excellent airlines and have potential of becoming a top class airlines in the region."
475,Alan D,5,"great airline from start to finish, the planes were clean,the staff were excellent <br>we would certainly fly again and would recommend them to others"
476,Scott D,4,"1st time flyer with Vietnam Airlines and was happy with the service I received  (have since done an internal flight same great service ).The seats were comfortable and had plenty of leg room (I'm over 6 foot) and I managed  to get some sleep too.....a rarety for me when doing long haul.The food was of good standard too with a choice of dishes (vegetarians ,vegans etc need to pre book meals).The flight attendants were smart and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The inflight entertainment had a good mix of new and classic blockbuster films,shows etc of both western and asian origin.Would have no hesitation in using this airline again when travelling to or around this area."
476,RugbyMadKiwi,5,"Great Airline from start to finish. A very friendly and helpful girl checked us in and there was no wait, they had lots of counters open for Business. The lounge was nice and the plane left right on time. Once again friendly staff on board and a nice meal was given. Smooth landing and our bags were promptly out. Highly recommended!"
476,Kathleen W,4,"It helps that the airport is a good one in HCMC, but Vietnam Airlines staff are professional, the flight took off on time, they are courteous and it felt safe.  New plane to Siem Reap. So a v v v g flight."
476,iangraham5,4,Our flight to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam was our first with this airline and our first experience of premium economy of any airline.<br>The seats reclined much more than economy and the seats were very comfortable.I am 6ft 2in and I had plenty of legroom.<br>The flight is just over 12 hours and I managed to sleep for about 6 hours which I have never managed before.
476,Steve,5,"My wife and I flew to Vietnam on holiday in August last year.  She is a frequent flyer due to her job, and I am the lucky man who gets to go away with her on some trips. <br>So I have now flown with all the main airlines, and Vietnam Airlines is a class above the others.  Great service, best food I have had on a flight, friendly because that is who they are and not the fake friendly with other airlines."
477,Elizabeth N,4,"Returning home from Hanoi to Sydney, we travelled via Ho ChiMin City. Transfer was smooth although we had to walk to terminal 2 and managed to get lost!<br>Both Hanoi and HoChiMin have limited duty free so no need to arrive early. Flight left on time with little delay. Would fly again with Vietnam Airlines. Staff always helpful!"
477,hoshibara,3,"When I flight to Ho Chi Minh, my seat was at the latest row. They served Beef with noodles and fish with rice. Most of the passengers chose Fish with rice and I didn't get for the choice of fish with rice. They just said sorry they could serve only Beef with noodles. One flight-attendant gave suggestion to have with bread instead of beef."
477,kentlee2018,4,The overall experience with VN is good and so far there is no delay in schedule. It will be good if they can plan a morning flight like 7-8 am from SIN to HCM.
477,graeme s,3,Plane was on time pushed back ontime <br>Did not even get a glass of water flight was only an hour but having also travelled on Bangkok air on this trip with similar distance we were offered a meal
477,John L,4,"I was very pleasantly surprised <br>Certainly not in the league of Singapore Airlines but very good non the less<br>Nice big seats , special menu and attentive staff<br>I would not hesitate to fly with them again"
478,Barry M,5,"Using Optiontown, a service which offers discounted upgrades, I was not disappointed as I boarded the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Sitting in row 4 in a semi podlike seat allowed me to have a decent rest and a few hours sleep on the 8 hour leg between Saigon and Melbourne the choice of food is ok but limited to entrees and three main courses. The wine selection was good and limitless. I will choose to fly Vietnam Air again."
478,RikavanR,5,"Had two domestic flights in Vietnam. Modern, clean and spacious aircraft with good food, service and on time. Highly recommended"
478,Varnie15,5,"Got a great Business Class airfare to London from Vietnam Airlines,have to say they are up there with other Airlines. Service was fantastic,the food was great and plenty of it. The staff were all very friendly,helpful no matter what time. The toilets very clean and cleaned by staff regularly.<br>The flat beds are good but if your taller than 5'11 then it may be a bit uncomfortable.Plenty of entertainment,great menu and plenty of wine,spirits etc<br>Value for money. Yes I will fly with then again. They have Sky Priority<br>Only short fall their Business Class Lounge in Hanoi is dated needs a total overhaul and a bit more Western style food"
478,Fazli Makali,4,This is my second time on this carrier. Price is reasonable and service is good. You cant really fault anything for sort distance.
478,th252015,5,"We used this airline 3 times whilst travelling Vietnam.<br>Check in was quick and easy for all flights, we even got emergency exit seats on all flights too!<br>No delays whatsoever, In fact 1 flight was brought forward!<br>Luggage arrived In good time, so all in all stress free and good value."
479,Thomas W,4,"Ho chi min bound was awesome if u get chance ask for exit seats aisle 26 or 25 in economy it's worth it, doesn't cost any extra . Service and food was good . Down side coming home service was lacking which was unfortunate, wanted to buy duty free from flight but was told locked away and food was not up to standard which was a shame , even staff not keen to help and directions from crew was barely audible and hard to hear <br>Would give them another go could be just one of those days ."
479,Malcolm S,4,We were unsure what to expect but overall the service was good and the Dreamliner is a great aircraft to travel on. The bonus is flying directly to Hanoi in just under twelve hours the alternative being a seventeen hour flight via Dubai
479,Alexis052018,3,"Hi,<br>I had a flight from Paris to Bangkok with Air France and then to Ho Chi minh with Vietnam Airlines. I arrived the 3rd of April in HCM City but my luggage arrived only the 7th in the evening. I had to buy clothes during 5 days.<br>Air France refused to reimburse my expenses saying Vietnam Airlines had to pay for this.<br>Vietnam Airlines has only accepted to reimburse my business shirts. It seems i should have stayed without pans, socks, underpans during these 5 days.<br>This is not acceptable. And I will complain in another way.<br>When we fly with a luggage, we attend it to arrive in time. Or that the company takes his responsibility to reduce the burden we face when it""s not there."
479,WillJune,4,"The plane looked relatively new, the staff were attentive, the entertainment was adequate.  The plane left on time and arrived slightly early.  Overall a flight which does not attract too much attention is a good flight"
479,Sramrevo,3,Selected Vietnam Airlines because it offered direct flight from Jakarta to Ho Chi Minh City. The plane is comfortable and clean but without in-seat entertainment system which was disappointing for a 3 hour flight. Meal service was average at best but the flight was certainly value for money. Pay slightly more than budget airlines but for the full service.
480,Susanna26,5,Flight left on time and arrived as planned. Luckily the flight was not full so I had 3 seats for myself so could crash out. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only niggle was that I ordered a low fat meal which was not very tasty or creative..
480,C2478CApatricks,4,"The service from the Vietnam airlines office in Sydney was exceptional when I called to change a flight, they even found a better price.<br>The planes were clean the food was fine, (but I don't catch flights for the food). I want to get to my destination &amp; back safe with my luggage arriving intact at the same time.<br>Our flights were cheaper than I could find with some of the other airlines, but the service and whole experience from the check in to the luggage collection felt proffesional and easy."
480,bobble2018,4,"We had a very pleasant flight, with great service. The food and facilities on plane where very good."
480,Stephen P,5,"Fantastic friendly service with adequate leg room for me at 185 cm.  Food and beverage service all complimentary and of good quality. Flight came as part of a package so unable to rate it on affordability, but given that the deal was with trip a deal, I would say affordable."
480,acarter2018,5,"First flight of day out, was superb. 1 hour, checkin to departure, 10 mins other end and out. Definitely easiest flight I’ve ever taken."
481,4hviet,3,"although VN airlines is better than Vietnam air companies, its services is only average. it is trying to improve its quality but still. especially service on flights, sometimes late and no excuses, impolite crew even on international flights."
481,Linjotravels,4,"Decided on Vietnam airlines as Emirates was too expensive on this route.....flight was good, service was good. Full service airline so got 30 kilos luggage which was great for the return trip! Food left a little to be desired but it was ok. For what we paid for the trip, we got an excellent deal!"
481,Maria3851,4,Good Airlines for Asia. Vietnam people are the best when it come to service. They were very polite and processed the checked in with no problem. We used Vietnam Airlines in transit to Europe. We stayed in Hanoi for 2 weeks to acclimatised and flew to Frankfurt. Vietnam is very service friendly and very much value for money wherever you go. We visited Hue and Hoi An on the way back to Sydney.  Its worth noting the return flight is always late in the evening so you virtually sleep all the way back to Sydney. Highly recommended as they are now flying with Dreamliner aircraft and they are the best.
481,Geoff S,5,Clean modern aircraft with choice of Western or Asian food served by friendly staff who will cater for all need of the International passanger
481,Jan Mi5,4,"We actually were in Premium Economy seating. Seat comfy with plenty of space. The on board staff were very helpful and courteous. <br>Food was very good, obviously based for Asian culture.<br>Entertainment had varied choice but again not huge variety for western travellers.<br>Toilets kept clean at all times.<br>We flew via Saigon to Australia and back home via Hanoi."
482,Mark S,5,This was the first of several flights internal and then back to uk. All very good on tine and the staff brilliant . New planes
482,Sylvia W,2,"We traveled in a family of 4 (2A2C), the flight back from Osaka to Singapore had allocation of individual seat to all 4 of us, of which my gal is only 9y/o.<br>I questioned the airport staff on such terrible seats arrangement yet she told me it can’t be helped and the flight is full. <br>I could only asked 1 of the kind passenger to swop his seat with me so that I can sit with my little gal while my hubby &amp; son are seated alone in other row with the strangers. After the flight took off, I then realized the flight wasn’t full as per what the staff described, there was few empty rows with no body sitting! This is really absurd for such a terrible seat arrangement for a family traveling with young kids.<br>Only if costs is of priority to u, else don’t take Vietnam airline if u are traveling with kids as they don’t even bother about the needs of putting the kids to sit with their parents."
482,pratibha46,3,Economical and excellent airline.<br>Food and service was very great.<br>I was treated with utmost importance and kindness.<br>Everyone was very friendly.
482,Lyn R,5,"We upgraded to Premium Economy due to the length of the flight.  We were thoroughly spoilt from the time we entered the plane until we arrived at our destination!!  The seats and interior of the plane (A 'Dreamliner') were extremely comfortable with all electronic and domestic accessories to hand.  The flight was non-stop so we did not have to disembark during the whole journey.  The food, drink and service was excellent and always delivered with a smile!!  Thank you to all, a wonderful way to start and end a fantastic ""holiday"" !!"
482,Lynda H,5,"It was the first time we had flown with Vietnam air lines granted it was business class, but it was a brilliant flight, the staff couldn't do enough for you the food &amp; drink were all very good quality and plenty of it. The seats were very comfy with plenty of room to lie out. I would recommend them to anyone in fact we will be flying with them again next year."
483,Carly Ann Louise,5,"HAving never flown anything other than big UK airlines before, was a bit dubious about using this carrier however - <br>-Flights were on time<br>-well organised boarding <br>- food was great- service efficient <br>-frequent hot towels<br>- good drink menu<br>- same as virgin 1st class - only difference was no mattress topper for the seat  - quilt and pillow provided<br> - smooth take off an landing <br><br>paid 2k for return flights from london - exceptionally cheap and well worth it for 16 hours"
483,Thông Lê,4,"Been flied with them several time. It's all business trip and fee was covered by my my company so I will not make any comment about the price. But in overall experience is good for me. The weight limitation is good, their food is ok too. And the crew aslo polite and helpful. Clean seat with entertainment small tv for economy. <br>Lately they has improve the check-in and now we can check-in online and choose our seat beforehand. I really like this since it reduce the load of check-in at airport and also convenient for us as customer."
483,carolw621953,5,"The airport staff were very friendly and spoke good English. We had  to catch the train from the Air Asia airport to the KL airport to get our Vietnam Air flight, which was really easy once some friendly locals assisted us with directions. Good food and roomy seats were such a bonus and the Vietnam Air staff are very courteous and helpful."
483,Scott B,5,We traveled Vietnam airlines to &amp;from Vietnam as well as two internal flights and found that the service was excellent the seats were roomy and comfortable and the food and drinks were amazing. Highly recommended airline 👍👍👍👍👍
483,Brian W,5,Both flights were good with excellent Western meals and Vietnamese meals. Plenty of attention from cabin staff on the trips One small complaint. The golf game on the seat monitor did not work on the first flight. Had to watch movies instead.Good legroom in the economy seats.
484,Sue R,4,Check in was about average. If there were spare seats we were allowed to spread out. Movies and show selections were good and reasonably recent. Cabin crew were attentive to everyone and even gave out packs with socks and toothbrushes. Blankets and pillow provided at no extra cost. Staff were calm and obliging.
484,juzau,4,"We booked this flight months in advance to flying online from Australia, never thinking too much about it. Then when we arrived we were suddenly a litte worried about checking in etc given our lack of Vietnamese. Anyway, check out was no more challenging than anywhere else. The flight was fairly basic, but so was the price. However everything was clean and comfortable and I would certainly fly with them again (in fact we did. A journey was planned from Danang to HCMC in order to get home). Recommended with kids. Hahaha!"
484,ClairePham35,5,"I've experienced many time for both domestic and international planes with VietnamAirlines. Still, always trust them for their accurate time and comfortable service/ queries.<br>They will be ready and listen to you whenever you have any problems or concerns"
484,Denise M,5,"First time we had flown with Vietnam airlines, and what a pleasant surprise.  We managed to  upgrade at check in for the outward journey and that was brilliant, extra large seats, service second to none.  Good quality food and drink and plenty of it.  Return journey was very full so we couldn't upgrade but having said that there was still plenty of leg room even for our friend who has long legs and had not long had a knee operation.  Service again was brilliant and quality of food and drink was no less than the outward journey."
484,Jake Nguyen,4,"I had been had experience flight with many Airlines company around the world, but in South East Asia I felt most comfortable with Vietnam Airlines, the 4* airlines with reason cost, new aircrafts, delicious foods. So I think you should be try flight with Vietnam Airlines if you travel in South East Asia or travel another country flight from Vietnam."
485,arindamdeb,4,"good airlines, service is very good. sufficient leg room in economy class. Overall good experience. For domestic travel in vietnam it is the best one."
485,nwg1953,1,"Flight from Ha noi to Sydney 2/5/18, check in put me in rear of plane with three seats after I asked. A very rude woman with a disabled son decided her son should move from the seat he was allocated to one next to me, she wanted a vacant seat next to her,, I complained to male steward and they were about to put him in another seat when another steward, female decided it was ok so I had to endure a very uncomfortable flight. I was not happy as I asked for this seating arrangement as I am over 6 ft tall, older man with health problems and I needed the extra room for some sort of comfort, that is why I asked for a rear seat with nobody next to me. The Vietnamese woman was very rude to me and scoffed at me when her problem child was allowed to stay next to me,, not happy Vietnam airlines! Passengers are required to stay in their allotted seats especially on a take off and landing, this was not done. I might add that the seats next to me we’re not the only vacant ones, there were other options."
485,wydiuty,5,"Maybe my expectations weren't high, as I was travelling with an airline from a 'communist country' but the customer service was a very high standard with quality food and drinks served throughout the flight by courteous and attentive crew.<br>Vietnam Airlines could certainly show British Airways how to provide good customer service."
485,xxmuttleyxx,4,paid for premium up grade seats very comfortable service good free pack no eye blinds for over night return flight cabin screens very bright<br>Food was worse I have had in longtime
485,ann lauchlan,5,Flown with this airline a few times the service is excellent happy smiling faces seat good plenty of leg space. Food very nice. Peaceful watch entertainment or just snooze  Felt good at end if journey comfortable seating clean value for money
486,wallaby,4,"Was surprised by the quality of the airline<br>Premium economy was so much better than I thought it would be and was cheaper than all of the major carriers economy class.<br>Food was reasonable, seats where excellent and the service was fine.<br>Will definitely fly again when going to Europe.<br>Great to be able to have a stopover in Vietnam on the way home to break up a long trip."
486,TrickyPerth,4,"We travelled with Vietnam Airlines on ten sectors through Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. All flights were on time, staff courteous and helpful, food adequate and no luggage was lost. <br>It’s hard not recommend this airline for travel in South East Asia based on our experience."
486,jockhkg,4,"No real complaints. Only that business class lounge fare was pretty lousy. In the air, whilst its common practice throughout Asia to be served warm drinks with the option to add ice I didn't expect it on a reputable airline regardless of business class or economy."
486,Suprio2012,5,overall experience very good. quality of food was good. right from airport entrance to airport exit everything was good
486,cptrelentless,2,"They'd really squeezed those seats into that plane.  Although neither of us was particularly fat me and the lady next to me spent a lot of time doing the conga round each other and inadvertently poking each other.  It was a 787 but quite an old one, quite tatty with taps not working in the toilets.  Food was passable if you were lucky enough to get a choice.  They ran out of the one that sounded edible pretty quickly.  Don't sit in the high 30s if you want to get served.  Where I was they'd run out of everything.  Service was pretty poor, they don't really look after you with snacks or drinks of juice or water during the night, like the other lines do.  You have to chase them for it all the time.  The staff seemed a little overwhelmed with it all, the language barrier didn't help, their English was very poor, not many of us speak Vietnamese.  The entertainment was fairly limited, it would make sense to have subtitles for your films if you are going to have the majority as foreign language films.  If there's a dozen Japanese, Korean and Chinese films on a UK to Vietnam flight."
487,carolynneary6,5,"Great price.<br>Only snag was longer stopovers in Vietnam, but it was in a business class lounge.<br>But hey everything has a downside.<br>Good food and service, comfortable bed."
487,SusanManlyNSW,4,Faultless service good planes excellent food. We had an overnight stop over in Saigon and the airlines provided lovely hotel and meals plus a local guide to organize our visa and take us by taxi to and from hotel next morning. <br>All excellent.
487,vocalisa,5,"Last time I was on this flight in 2015. This time I met friendly and helpful staff all the way from the check in, boarding and on board ! The plane was brand new and comparably spacious, the seats comfortable, the screens for each passenger in the back of the seat in front, large selection of entertainment, all working  and easy to operate. The flight attendants had heartfelt smiles. I was offered instant coffee in the early morning before breakfast, when I only asked for hot water. Such a big difference to my former experiences."
487,dragonO76,5,"We have an appointment at 4pm in Singapore, and took Vietnam airline at 10:30am from Hanoi, that made us did not disappoint, things go smoothly, good foods and service for nearly 03 hours flight with them, highly recommend Vietnam airline."
487,TravelwithGar,5,I have to say we were hugely impressed by the level of service and exceptional food quality on this 5~ hour Dreamliner flight. Flight left bang on time &amp; we got in a bit early. Staff very warm &amp; friendly.<br><br>Highly recommend this Airline.
488,Duy Hung P,5,"Very good service &amp; support the client, they are willing to serve all customers, you can spend time with VN airlines to see the differences"
488,MikeO,5,"I have been going backward and forward from Sydney to Vietnam for a number of years now and have always flown with Vietnam Airlines.  From the first to the last trip I have been well pleased with the courteous and friendly service on all occasions.<br><br>The check-in at Sydney Airport was seamless and an additional boarding pass was issued from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang (my eventual destination) by efficient Qantas staff.<br><br>Business class in the new Dreamliner 787-9 is most comfortable with a one, two, one individual pod seating arrangement.  This allows maximum room to be available to each passenger including the ability to change the seat to a lie flat bed.<br><br>The dinner and supper menu selections were comprehensive and delicious every time. <br><br>As I said before - I can't see any reason why I would not fly Vietnam Airlines."
488,Charlie T,1,"the internet check-in unavailable for overbook. you never know they may cancel of flight without any hotline, the hotline they mention is not available since 1 Aug 2017 but still listed as their hotline.<br><br>The other hotline is office tel. You have no mean to know what happen forward. Since my flight is the last flight for BKK- back to SGN, And i have to back to SGN for sure, i have to go to the airport in 10 hours before the flight to guarantee there are either i have a seat or a flight--<br><br>Horriable"
488,mike w,5,"We were late arriving in Ho Chi Min City from another airline and we missed our connecting flight. The last thing a weary traveller needs is more stress. The ground staff at Vietnam Airways were so, so helpful. Nothing was beyond their power to make things work and to get us to Da Nang. I cannot praise them highly enough. Fantastic and nothing was too much trouble."
488,YannNguyen0404,4,I always use Vietnam Airlines for domestics travel. <br>This airline offers the best service in the country with friendly staffs and nice food.
489,QHYong,4,"Although travel with an A321, I got arranged to a seat at emergency exit with extra leg space. Overall service is very good and the meals provided are sooooooo delicious. Value for money!"
489,aluthuy,4,"It was a pleasant in time flight with standard services for economy class. If you want a reasonable fare, just slightly higher than other budget airlines but good service, then Vietnam Airlines is the choice."
489,Sue W,5,Was very impressed with both the service and the food which we received on this flight which also included two meals.  Cannot fault in any way.Didnt need to pay for any extras as everyone received excellent treatment and service from the staff.
489,Toshikazu E,3,"The staff are full of good intentions, but they are inexperienced. I traveled with my daughter and two little grandkids. There was this one staff memberat Narita who took very good care of us, but once leaving the airport counter we had hard time keeping ourselves safe. We almost fell over with nobody helping us going up and down the landing steps. We were directed to a wrong bus to the terminal building. Very few member can speak English or Japanese....Someone must have notified. Everything changed when we took the flight back home. We were paged and given special treatment. After all they are good."
489,Extreme-traveler101,5,"I decided to use Vietnam Airlines for my 8 hour flight from Sydney to Vietnam. The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was amazing- you got both a Western menu and a Vietnamese menu both containing a decent range for the flight duration. It was comfortable even in economy.  Great value for money and the overall experience was fantastic., I highly recommend."
490,Gary B,5,Vietnam 🇻🇳 Airlines are great we flew to Saigon and then onto South Korea they are so good in service courtesy and service even when we fly economy it’s the same my friends and family fly with them all the time love their Dreamliner give them a try
490,shemmas,4,We flight Sydney - HCMC and then HCMC to Danang and returned the same way. All flights were very good. No issues at all. Only improvement they could make was that the announcenents over the PA system were very hard to understand as English was very limited and the audio system not the best. But in no way did this distract from a very smooth and great international and domestic flight. Very easy to get from domestic in HCMC to international airport.
490,Harvey P,5,"Easy check-in with lines moving swiftly. Greeted on board by smiling and welcoming cabin crew. Food selection was great and tasted good - Luke Nguyen is a great chef. Flight was on time and went well, connection in Ho Chi Min was easy. In flight entertainment was a good range of movies and TV - including both new releases (Three Billboards was great) and some old favourites (I enjoyed watching Fame for the first time in many years)."
490,Ted666,5,Good service as always. Their meals for vegetarians are a bit better than other air carriers which I've used.
490,Nicholas H,5,Great airline using the latest 787 jets. Service and quality of food made the flight of this long distance so much easier.
491,Grant L,5,Very comfortable seating for economy class and good leg room on the 787 Dreamliner. Good inflight entertainment system and very polite and courteous cabin attendants.
491,KikiSilly,5,"Even if it was a short flight, We got a best service and warm welcoming air crews, meals are so delicious 😋 and have more varieties for dinner or lunches."
491,港城女子 Ms. HK City,5,"I haven't traveled to Vietnam before so I don't have a pre-impression on the airlines but it really gave me a surprise. The service is just OK but we didn't really expect more than a flight, and it's the normal service standard for an ordinary HongKonger XD. The meal tasted good - pork would be a safe choice; the return flight offered a heated bread and others are conventional. NO DELAY very important. Everything is smooth. And of course I couldn't avoid the usual congestion I had in the HK Airport but everything is just fine for me. Would recommend it."
491,Vivien R,5,First time to Vietnam and flying Vietnam airlines. Pleasantly surprised with the service and seat room. Flights were delayed by about half an hour or so each time but apart from that would definitely recommend Vietnam Airlines and would fly with them again.
491,522serapk,5,"We recently flew with Vietnam Airlines for our 3rd trip to Vietnam and they're definitely the best airline to fly with.  Modern aircraft, pleasant crew, best schedules to Vietnam and really good domestic connections within the country.  We had a very comfortable flight to Ho Chi Minh and connected through to Phu Quoc.  Due to our tight connection, ground staff were waiting for us at Ho Chi Minh and they made sure we made a speedy customs clearance and escorted us to the domestic terminal.  Great service both in the air and on the ground"
492,michaelfS6596PW,5,This was my 5th flight from Hanoi to Shanghai on Vietnam Airlines.  The past trips have all been on A321 aircraft.  Recently Vietnam Airlines has been bringing A350 and B787 aircraft into service on their more popular routes.  This flight was on a new A350 in which Economy Class is configured 3x3x3.  Seat width and legroom are ample even for me at 6 feet and 250 pounds.  As the flight is 2.5 hours there was full beverage and meal service at no charge including beer and wine. I had curry fish with rice and vegetable.  Presentation and taste were both very good.  Baggage allowance on checked luggage is 20Kg free of charge and you are also allowed one carry-on and owner personal item.  Trip cost for one way ticket was less than $250 U.S.
492,Anne T,5,"My husband &amp; I flew with Vietnam Airlines on a direct flight from Hanoi to Sydney, opting for premium economy seats as it was an overnight flight &amp; we wanted a comfortable sleep.  Left at midnight, arriving just after midday into Australia.  There was SO much leg room - I was able to fully extend my legs.  Media &amp; trays were in arm rests, so there was no impact at all on other passengers from reclining seats.  The configuration was 2-2-2.  Service was prompt, food excellent &amp; great choice of current movies.  Price was great for the extra comfort."
492,bernard l,5,"Flew in a full flight between these two destinations in May. Luckily was sitting in an exit row with plenty of space to move around.<br>Although it is only a 2 and a half hour flight, a whole meal is served with choices of juices, beer and wine.<br>Overall service was excellent and the plane extremely clean (including lavatories).<br><br>Vietnam Airlines continues to impress me."
492,Aussieguy71,3,"It was my first time flying VN on my recent visit to Vietnam. <br>Good customer service, all staff have some degree of English - even the Captain.<br>They have a good selection on movies and music in their entertainment line up, but not as much selection as the big carriers in the market.<br>They have modern aircraft in their fleet with a little more leg room in economy.<br>Meals were ok. The only thing that I could fault would be their drinks.<br>They don't keep anything cold. If you order Coke or Fanta, it comes out on the drinks trolley at room temperature. If you ask for come they serve it in a little cup and only half fill it. Enough for 2 mouth fills. But it's very affordable to travel with this carrier to Vietnam and back. I would fly with them again...yes."
492,George R,5,"This Airline is up with the best.... new aircraft, good food and efficient caring staff who are quick to respond and with a smile. They even serve HOT tea and coffee. Thoroughly recommend if you want to fly non-stop to Ho Chi Minh City ✈️👍"
493,99xandra,5,Excellent Airline. Left on time and the service was excellent. I had requested special meals and they went out of their way to check if everything was good. The crew kept all the passengers upto date with information.
493,Adam Harrison,3,We recently flew from Melbourne to Siem reap Business Class with Vietnam Airlines upon checking in in Melbourne we were treated to the rudest man whom luckily did not work for V/A but Qantas as Qantas handled the check in process. As he was in charge of where our luggage ended up we didnt say anything and fortunately this was the only negative service we experienced during our flight over and return. The food was disappointing both flights and inedible on the way home. The seats were amazing though and as I said the service apart from check in was excellent.
493,Samantha I,5,I would highly recommend this airline. Nothing was too much trouble. It was a comfortable on the way over as there weren't many people flying but on the way back it was a little cramped. We had a special request meal and that arrived before all other meals and was absolutely fantastic. All in all I would fly Vietnam Airlines again.
493,ChezmossAustralia,5,"Vietnam Airlines came up 10/10 for a full class airline operating from Australia. Seating was comfortable ( and I am not small), friendly staff immediately handed out pillows, blankets, headphones. Lunch had varied choices, alcohol was served and offered again, also tea and coffee. Onboard entertainment had quite an extensive list of movies, music..both English and Vietnamese.. I enjoyed the latest movie with Hugh Jackman. A further light meal was served a couple of hours before landing. I would definitely travel again and highly recommend to others."
493,AlisonCheshireUK,1,"Having flown premium economy with TUI on 2 recent flights we were staggered at the difference-slow service, substandard quality of food, substandard quantity of drinks, plastic cutlery and never offered extra water during the flight. When we asked for some we were told to bring our original bottle (which had rolled into the seats behind &amp; the lights were out) for<br>re-filling. Genuinely shocked at the poor service on our outbound flight &amp; were intrigued about the return from Ho Chi Minh which was generally much better, however neither could be classed as premium in anything other than additional legroom-surprised they don’t get more complaints."
494,oberd2000,5,"We flew Economy Plus and the flight was very comfortable. The seating was relaxing, the service very good (food and staff) and the flight was in time. It was an A350, rather quiet! The returnflight (VN37) at the 26th of january 2018 was as good as the flight to Hanoi."
494,josephine17,5,Had a wonderful flight on Vietnam airlines.  Food was excellent and the flight attendants were superb.  Nothing was too much trouble for them.  Food was lovely and well presented.  Would fly with them again.
494,Susan A,5,"I recently flew to Vietnam with Vietnam Airlines and l can't fault them. I had several internal flights on this tour,the staff were friendly and very helpful.l would not hesitate to fly with them again."
494,wireless_in_CA,4,"I flew Vietnam airlines from HAN to PVG on my first A350 flight and it was a very nice plane.  There were three classes of service and I was in Economy.  Seats were relatively comfortable and the individual seat back screen seemed to a bit larger than other planes.  Condition of interior was very good, lots of overhead luggage space and the bathrooms were roomier than I expected and kept clean throughout our flight.  The flight background noise seemed quieter like the 787 I previously flew on this same route.<br><br>The flight was practically full.  We used group check in (supposed to be a minimum of 10 passengers but she was accommodating) to avoid the long check in queue.  <br><br>For lunch I selected the fish in curry sauce, green veggies and rice and it was one of the best airplane meal eaten in this trip so far.  The dessert was some kind of mousse cake which was also very good, not too sweet or heavy. The only complaint was the attendant would not give out more than one pack of the roasted peanuts and peas.  The peanuts were crunchy and just salty enough for me but not enough quantity. <br><br>Overall service and experience was one of the best for this multi-country trip."
494,kiefeash23,5,Just a few years back on my way home from work to be the first half of the day before I get a follow back please
495,Steven T,4,"fantastic service, really comfortable, considering it was a 13 hour flight it passed quickly. Was able to sleep welll and the entertainment system is really quite good. Food is very good and drinks available throughout"
495,Bronwyn G,4,"They did instructions in Vietnamese and English, good checking standards to ensure the right person with the right luggage boards and leave airport. Only allows 20kg checked bags but ours weighed less than expected scales might need calibration but at least we didnt have excess baggage"
495,canadianbeaver2018,4,"This is a much better airline when it comes to luggage allowance and luggage fees. Way better than Vietjet Airlines. And ends up being much cheaper than Vietjet. The flight was fine p, on time, comfortable and I have no complaints."
495,Ana P,5,"I used this airline for first time to go from London to Vietnam, also for some internal flights in Vietnam and back to England.<br>I was very impressed with the service and the amount and quality of food and drinks provided in each flight, even in short flights. I will definately use this airline again."
495,Judi T,4,It is our third time flying with Vietnam Air this was by far the most comfortable in the new Dreamliner in internal flights to Danang were also quite good we would certainly recommend
496,Sandy A,5,"If your traveling to Vietnam, then there is no better airline then Vietnam air. Seating is comfortable, airline staff are friendly. There is always a chance to get a cheap upgrade using Optiontown. Try it you won’t regret it."
496,Goochmaster,1,"Vietnam airlines ruined my family holiday. After booking 6 months in advance sectors between Ho Chi Min to Hue, Da Nang to Da Lat and Da Lat to Saigon, across a 3 month period each flight sector changed not once, not twice but at least 3 times. As they changed each time, they screwed up my holiday which you plan accommodation on expedia and can't change. Making clear your disappointment doesn't work either, they just don't care. As an example a flight from Saigon to Hue was moved by 20 mins, they didn't;t tell me and then meant I would miss the connection. I had to book an extra nights accommodation to avoid being stuck at the airport for 5 hours, only later to find out 2 months later that it was futile because they changed my flight to Hue from 11.30am the next morning to 9.30am making it a tight dash to the airport with kids and grandma in tow.<br><br>So whilst you have no option, sometimes it is better to remember that Vietnam airlines is unreliable prior to the flight and has terrible customer service."
496,Silverrmoon,5,"It was a great pleasure to travel with this airline, as it felt like a home.<br>Had a chance to travel with this airline from Hanoi to HCMC, and it was just awesome.<br>The flight attendants in flight were very pleasant and helpful<br>Food provided in flight was also great.<br><br>Would like to travel with this airline again."
496,Matt S,5,"Good airline. Flight was smooth. Staff onboard were good, this time we had a choice of soft drinks. Not a budget airline but not no frills. Would fly again"
496,Matt S,5,They were decent enough. Flight was smooth and cabin crew were polite and attentive. Got a cup of water as a refreshment. Short flight so no inflight entertainment. No complaints
497,teegee56369,4,"Frequent business class pax on VN Air, wife and I commend the service this airline provides on a consistent basis. Flights are frequently on schedule, and on board service comparable with other airlines. Airfares are very reasonable on all routes, especially on domestic sectors within Vietnam. Have enjoyed flying with this airline for many years and remain a satisfied customer."
497,849barry,5,Staff very pleasant but a very basic service one meal on the way out and had to ask for a drink of water.  It was a very long flight so I did expect a few more rounds of soft drinks at the very least to come around. Films ok  on an internal flight with them in Vietnam given a couple of rice cakes. Hardly worth the effort
497,Olga6680,3,"Our flight was about 9 hours long. As it was my first flight with VIetnam airlines I was pleasantly suprised at the generous legroom on a flight<br>However, TV entertainment could be improved as the variety of new releases was quite scarce. <br>Would recommend this airline for sure."
497,noel0412,4,"Flight and onboard service were all very good.  We flew Sydney to Saigon, Saigon to Cam Ranh (Nha Trang), Cam Ranh to Da Nang, then Da Nang to Saigon and Saigon to Sydney.  All flights were good experiences."
497,kenl461,3,Our group flew from Hanoi to Da Nang enroute to Hoi An on Vietnam Airlines.  The flight crew were friendly &amp; courteous.  The plane was very clean &amp; food was decent.
498,ginsengNewYork,5,"Had just taken a very unpleasant business class flight with Japan Air from Paris to Tokyo, and was a bit anxious about this long flight with a little known airline ( at least to me), but ended up very, very satisfied!<br>Did fly business class, which was way, way better than Japan Air!<br>The cabin layout is very pleasant, spacious:<br>The large seats are placed herringbone fashion, which gives you privacy while still being able to chat with your partner.<br>Seats are very comfortable and recline completely into a bed: I had the best sleep ever, and I rarely sleep on a plane as I am a bit anxious.<br>Crew is welcoming and attentive.<br>Check in and check out were efficient and fast. The lounge was fine but a bit crowded.<br>The only improvement we suggest on board is in flight entertainment ( film selection for westerners is a bit poor and seems to cater more to Asian clients; would have loved to watch Vietnamese movies but there were no subtitles) <br>Food is good enough, but could be more refined.<br>All in all a very pleasant international flight! <br>Good value and highly recommended!<br>We also took internal flights from Hanoi which were quite satisfactory: they were on time, and we were even served meals on 2hour flights!!!"
498,YTB KOREA S,1,"친절한 고객 서비스와 항공사 티어 혜택을 원하는 사람이라면 절대로 비추하는 항공사입니다. 그 이유는 아래의 영어를 읽어보세요.<br><br>Even as I am a Platinum(highest tier in VNA) member of Vietnam airlines, but 'NEVER' get upgrade to business class. Compared to other airlines, Vietnam airlines rarely upgrade seat for their high tier customers.<br>And their mileage is so difficult to use. Very limited tickets for Skyteam mileage booking and thier value of mileage is possibly the lowest value in the world.<br>Not only that, cannot try status challenge to other airlines;united air,etc with this SH***Y airline tier. <br>And their service is not very kind, because as I heard cabin crews are only employed from high class such as government officers or Vietnam communist party members' daughters and sons. Or have to pay lots of bribe to get employed."
498,charliebigtime,2,"What a bad first experience with this budget airline.Despite being advised to check in 2 hours prior to flight no staff arrived until 1 hour before.We walked to the gate,no staff there.The flight time came nothing.1 hour later staff arrived and the TV screen showed 1830 estimate for 1700 flight.At 1830 we took a bus to the perimeter wall of the airport to board a plane.We sat on the plane until 2000hrs with no water offered and the crew hiding behind the curtain.When the plane took off the cabin was filled with a cloud.I thought ""This is it"" but it was water vapor.<br>Finally arrived in Phnom Penh 8 hours after leaving home.The bus only takes 6 hours and picks you up from your hotel at a fraction of the cost."
498,vietbabieblu,2,"We were on the plane total of 12hrs, they served dinner once right after take off. Then breakfast 30 mins before landing and nothing in between.  No snack or anything.  My husband was hungry and asked for a cup noodles and was told can't serve it since the seat belt light was on. .. and it was on over an hour.  During that time they did serve drinks in between.  So I wonder why they can't serve cup noodles? We tried multiple times to get it, we went in the back n saw the flight attendant was eating a bowl of noodles herself! At this point my husband was super hungry and mad, he had to complain to the other flight attendant that serving first class, then was accommodate for it.  I just don't get the whole we can't serve you but I'm eating in the back with mine ....smh. never again.  <br>We flew air France coming there and it was the best experience!"
498,dinesh r,3,A traveler from Chennai to Vietnam by Singapore airlines carried 30 kgs but and on return from ho chi Minh to Cambodia back to Chennai. The Vietnam airlines permit only 20 kgs from ho chi Minh to Cambodia. How is it possible to carry only 20 kgs from ho chi Minh City to Cambodia alone and then carry 30 kgs from Singapore to Chennai.eventhough the flight from ho chi Minh to Cambodia is international I had to remove my excess weight over 20 kgs and fly or had to pay up for excess weight.so please be prepared for such weight regulations before flying through Vietnam airways
499,Fitzu17,4,"Very impressive. Big seats, plenty of legroom, good service &amp; entertainment. Premium Eco costs a few hundred more than Economy &amp; its well worth it. Business costs a few thousand more; in comparison. Slept most of the flight home too. Went for a walk around the plane mid flight &amp; I felt sorry for those in economy."
499,Renald L,5,On board personnel are very friendly and they even served a meal on this short flight.  Their efficiency in unsurpassed well done to all crew members
499,lesley b,3,"We upgraded to premier economy which cost an extra £600 each,  the crew couldn't wait to shut down the cabin. The food was served like warm and Norbert nice at all and when <br>we  asked for a Gin and Tonic we were given half a small bottle on the outward journey and not offered anything on the return. I needed the bathroom and had to wait 10 minutes whilst one of the crew changed. We will only use again if no other option."
499,Phobos1967,4,The air-plane itself is great (Dream Liner) ans they are quite new and well looked after. <br><br>Great flight with an above average array of food.  <br><br>If we had one criticism it would be that the air hostesses were not overly friendly at all which is unusual for Vietnamese people in general as they are great.
499,MaggieC56,4,"In April we flew from Sydney to Paris with a 2 hour  stopover in Hanoi.We flew premium economy and I would highly recommend the airline. Service was great, plenty of legroom, good size seat, customer service great, inflight entertainment could have room for improvement mainly more movies.Value for money excellent we flew premium for the cost of economy with other airlines."
500,lamdu0ng,5,We had a logistics change with the planes and ended up on Vietnam Airlines rather than Vietjet . We had all of the mod cons thay would be expected of the Carrier. We were seated in emergency door exit with the bonus of extra leg room!
500,FG3441,5,"Vietnam airlines flight provides a very friendly service from check in to inflight  services. Used thrice this month and always on time, fairly new planes, allows 20 kg of one check in  baggage. Not very picky on weight and allows reasonable overage. In my experience on domestic services it is a 3 to 4 star airline."
500,Sandra L,3,Our group flew Vietnam Airlines from Hue to visit Ho Chi Minh City prior to embarking the Mekong Navigator for our river cruise to Cambodia.  <br><br>We found Vietnam Airlines to be very clean and the flight attendants to be friendly &amp; courteous.
500,Lottie M,5,"After booking the Airline told me, that my flight date changed, but they offered me many options of changing the date or getting my money back. I decided to change the date. This worked out efficient and quickly, communication via Email was easy.<br>So my flight from luang prabang to hanoi: we departed earlier, then flew for an hour in circles above Hanoi cause there was a big thunderstorm. The airplane landed in Vinh, then started to Hanoi again after the thunderstorm calmed down. I felt save at all times, the captian spoke to us the entire time.<br>Because of the thunderstorm I missed my connecting flight to Frankfurt. But there was a Lady waiting for me, she gave me a new flight schedule and was really sorry for me missing my flight. So I flew 2 hours later to London. The flight was quite fine, a little bumpy sometimes. Arriving in London I got to get my flight to Frankfurt. At the Airport they told me, the flight to London with Lufthansa is overbooked. But Vietnam Airlines managed it to save me a seat! That surprised me heavily, cause its a flight with a different Company! But everything worked out perfectly!<br>I arrived savely in Frankfurt and Just want to say thank you to Vietnam Airlines! They arranged everything for me quickly and I felt save and secure at all Times! There Was nothing to worry about! So thank you for your amazing Service!!!<br>I can highly recomment this airline!"
500,jkwthomas,4,"Overall, a pleasant experience. The check-in was efficient, the plane departed and arrived on schedule and the food service and in-flight entertainment was above average. The plane was very clean and the flight crew worked continuously to maintain it in this state."
501,blackninepatch,3,"I'm so glad the airline is not representative of the pleasant visit I had to their country of origin.  The fight from Guangzhou to Da Nang is less than three hours.  A meal is served, but I use the term loosely.  I haven't had such bad airline food since . . . . well, ever!  I've been flying for decades and the meal we had going and returning was just plain bad.  I couldn't even identify what was on the plate.  We aren't picky eaters, but both of us left our meals relatively untouched.  Drink options were very limited, too.  The onboard entertainment seemed to be a selection of YouTube-like shorts about kids playing practical jokes on people and stupid things people do.  It was the same video coming and going.  I read my book.  The flight attendants were professional, polite, and efficient.  The seating was as comfortable as one can get in Economy.  The plane was clean and personal lighting and vents worked well.  Blankets were available for those who got chill.  The cost of the flight was about the same as what I would pay Stateside for a 2-3 hour flight."
501,Gordon M,5,"A friend and i flew Vietnamese Airlines on our last trip to Nha Trang and found them extremely  good , you are fed onboard meals and the trip was very comfortable,  the day before our return my friend broke his ankle so when we eventually  boarded our flight home it was to my great relief that the ground staff right through to the cabin crew were so very helpful , this sought of service goes a long way especially  when you are far from home . Highly recommend."
501,Phượng B,1,"I got the flight from Saigon back to Danang tonight. When i was getting confused about my luggage because  honestly that was my first time with Vietnam Airline. I was totally disappointed! I always heard that Vietnam Airline got a high standard of service. But it was not right at all. I thought  that they adjust a book by its cover. Therefore, they looked down on us and unfriendly."
501,simon,1,"We are yet again sat in the airport due to technical problems! First at Heathrow we had a 26 hr delay due to technical problems and now boarded the plane at Hanoi, to be told get off as technical problems so sat in airport .we will not use or recommend this airline and we fly alot"
501,anniep522018,4,Travelled to da nang from Melbourne return <br>The crew were quite accomodating and meals were fine and they served alcohol etc<br>First time I have ever flown with them and my only criticism was that you can’t seem to book in on line and select your seats
502,hulagirlSurrey,5,"I flew Vietnam Airlines from LHR to Phnom Penh and then back from Siem Reap to LHR. Was very impressed with their service. Constantly bringing drinks and water, cold towels. Friendly crew."
502,Veebe64,4,I’m must say the business class was as good as all  other airlines. Service was excellent the hostess lovely and food was great<br>Travelled Vietnam Airlines across Vietnam and flights always on time
502,TravelEatXplore,4,"It was a long flight from the States to Ho Chi Minh and I needed to go to Danang that day. The round trip Business Class was about 150.00 USD.  The check in was easy. The plane is old and the seats aren't leather, but the leg room was plentiful. The business class services was excellent.  The food wasn't all that, but I just wanted the leg room and comfort after over 20 hrs flight."
502,Chloe,5,I offen use Vietnam airline when i travel. Their staff is friendly and professional . Comfortable seat
502,Yohan T,5,"This is the 2nd Vietnam flight on our trip and probably the best. The seats were clean, toilets were clean. Tray table was clean. <br>Food was good. <br>Service was on time. <br>No Wifi. <br>Average entertainment."
503,gibbos70,1,In the bus to get to the plane 30 minutes before we were able to get out<br>tv broken on a 13 hour flight and flight attendants were not happy to help or try to fix it<br>Only given one bottle of water between meals<br>When food arrived we had no choice as they had run out and were offered a tub of pot noodles!<br>Seats way too small<br>Will never fly with this airline again
503,htaccountants,5,"excellent flight&amp;service.good leg room.inflight staff very helpful.good asian food was provided for us being vegeterranean.inflight entertainment was mainly english movies.as in recent time lots of indians are visiting vietnam from uk,i suggest there should be some bollywood movies&amp; indian music.check in was very good.it was long direct flight.travelled first time with this airline and was very impressed overall.we had travelled in a group and all international/other flights to cambodia&amp; laos were with  the same airline."
503,Eddie H,5,"Great service, value for money and comfortable seating. On board meals were very tasty.<br>Both ground and flight staff extremely helpful and obliging."
503,Martinmjgh,5,"Just putting in one review my comments on several flights - both internal and international - with VNA.  <br>We had booked Business Class since it was such good value for money throughout, and all in all I felt it was money well spent.  On board, the seating was very comfortable and the service excellent.  Together with access to the comfortable and reasonably equipped lounges would have been enough - it was great to be able to relax before the flight.  However the real benefit came with the access to the rapid immigration and security lanes, both in and out of the airport.  We just whipped through - especially leaving HCMC where even early in the morning there was a massive queue to get through security.  We would have been there for (I am convinced) 30-60 minutes.  But we were straight through in well under 5.  Equally for immigration, we were straight through whilst the rest of the plane queued...<br>Would very much recommend and I would happily pay for Business Class with VNA again should I be fortunate enough to return (fingers crossed)"
503,Dean S,5,This time I flew Kuala Lumpur via Hanoi to London Heathrow.  The KL to Hanoi leg was 3 hours.  I was served a decent meal and a glass of wine.  At Hanoi airport I had to go thru security checks again but it didn't take very long.  There is free WiFi at Hanoi airport but it was slow.  There were shops and restaurants open until our flight left at 00;50.  I didn't expect another meal but we got one anyway and another drink.  I had beer this time.  The plane had a good entertainment system so I stayed awake until about 4am as it's a 13 hour flight.  I slept 6 or 7 hours and then breakfast was served.  I will stay awake until almost normal bed time tonight to beat the jet lag.
504,Nguyen T,5,Great service with reasonable fare price. There are new and big aircrafts and flight were always on time for me. Totally recommended.
504,barballen23,4,Great flight. Food service was cleared quickly. The hostesses were polite and diligent.  The leg room seemed better than other airlines.  Would fly with this airline again.
504,BlondeBunny,4,Very comfortable seats with lots leg room. Extremely polite and helpful staff. Meals were not very tasty but you could make do. You have your own TV in the seat. Not too many movie choices.
504,Elizabeth_David_12,5,"The new Dreamliner was a much improved configuration and comfort level than our past trip on the same route. The inflight service was impeccable, the meals were excellent. The inflight entertainment is more limited than other airlines we have flown but was adequate for our use. The check in was efficient and easy, the lounge comfortable. As we experienced long waits between our flights, Vietnam airlines provided us with a day accommodation, meal and transfers to Ho Chi Minh City. We arrived in Paris very relaxed."
504,karenkkl,4,I flew this airlines twice and both times I have only good things to say.  Both were very short so the service was water or coke.  The seats are more roomy than any other airline I have flown in for decades.  The fa were friendly and spoke English.  Boarding was easy and fast.  We needed to bus to the plane and that went well also.
505,Joelle H,4,"We booked our tickets online and checked-in at the airport. Everything went smoothly. Once on board, we had a pleasant flight. Legroom was not generous but comparable to most regular airlines (you are afraid to breath on some charter flights) and the food was edible. Our only recommendation would be to improve the selection of Western movies and allow passengers to start watching before take off, as nervous travellers (like myself) need to concentrate on something."
505,tfizzle,4,"nice little 2 hours light. Decent service, but don't eat the meals they don't look good and are packaged. Good service including a beer."
505,Adele M,5,Great service! Food very nice too! Plenty of leg room and in flight entertainment was very good also.Cabin clean and flight attendants very well presented and professional No complaints at all:)
505,vickygreed,4,the over all package from this airline was really good from international flights to domestic the service was fine . Only criticism was none of the onboard drinks are cold on any flight we had.
505,Con K,2,"I am quite disappointed with my most recent flight experience which was with Vietnam Airways. Firstly let me qualify my travel experience.. i have been to over 4o0 countries around the world,  with multiple inner trips thereafter.. i travel all different classes depending on my requirement. I am a frequent flyer with Qantas, virgin, Emirates, Etihad and Alitalia..<br>Just recently i flew Premium Economy back to Sydney and had quite a good seat on hhis flight. <br>The crew was so Automated that a simple request ended up ruining my flight experience and will negate me from ever flying with this airline again.<br><br>A COFFEE...YES A SIMPLE COFFEE.<br><br>Ehen rverone is sleeping and the crew wants to rest, dont ask them for a coffee as this will start the chain of ridiculousness and lies.<br><br>The flight was calm yet yhr captain to keep everyone sleeping turns the lights down 2 hours into the flight and turns on the seatbelt sign. Everyone except for 3 pax in the premium section sleeps including me. <br><br>2 hours later i wake up  seat belt sign still on, flight as dmooth as silk.<br><br>I then ask for a simple coffee from a sterwardess walking past me.. she nods and comes back 5 minutes later telling me we cant have  coffeee when the seat belt sign is on. This after i saw her ask her friend/associate about the coffee. <br><br>I donh question this but am dumbstruck when diring the breakfast serving 2 further hours later coffee is served with the seatbelt sign still on. <br><br>I question this and she smirks and looks across to her friend,  who quickly tells her to go back and stop serving coffee, although she keeps serving tea???.. now im getting frustrated.<br><br>She presses a button above her seat in the front pantry, the seat belt light disappears and out comes the coffee again when another passenger compains.<br><br>I now have my cup and the worst is yet to come.  <br><br>Breakfast was completed and an hour later i decided to ask gor another coffee...what a complex challenge!!!<br><br>Not only was it an issue but the voffee i was given was MUD.. ABSOLUTELY SOLID MUD.<br><br>I complained to the lady who seemed to be in charge, who offered and made me the weakest coffee in history, using obviously the reused grounds to ensure it was weak compared to the mud served beforehand as she advised my stewardess was new and used an entire sachet (used usually for the whole coffee thermos jug). <br><br>To clarify, i drink 15 coffees a day (yes i know thats a lot).. but to go 13 hours (including airport wait and customs in Sydney) with 2 coffees is a massive ask for  me especially when one can't be drunk.<br><br>Sadly I dont give airlines s second chance when Ive paid for a premium service and don't receive it. I wong list yhem here but other airlines are SOOOOOO much better in the service sector."
506,danakiley,4,"Our flight was very good really. We flew from Melbourne to HoChi Minh City then a domestic flight to Hanoi. The Quantas staff at Melbourne were booing people in for Vietnam Airlines. They told us we would not have to collect out luggage at HoChi Minh airport that it would be transferred straight to flight to Hanoi, but that wasn't the case luckily there were others on the same flight so we did have to collect and transfer. Other than that the staff were very friendly and helpful. Certainly plenty of food."
506,kentwell007,4,I flew to Saigon with Vietnam Airline with 7 other family members.<br>This Flight was great <br>On time <br>Seats were great <br>Service really good <br>Smooth flight <br>Food was awesome <br>This is a great airline make sure you give it a go
506,Jia,4,"Chose to fly with Vietnam airline for my recent trip to Hanoi and Da Nẵng because the price was much lower compared to AA airline with meals and luggage inclusive. The seats were not as comfortable as other full-service airlines like Eva Air or Cathay Pacific but it was still okay for Asians. Counter staffs were very friendly and attentive to your needs. They were very helpful when I requested to have the seats together with my partner. Inflight meals were fine with a rating of 4/5 from us. The inflight entertainment was very minimal with a drop-down screen shared by 2-3 rows of passengers. But overall the flying experience was okay. For those flying from Malaysia to Vietnam, kindly check out their websites for their prices as it can be quite cheap sometimes too."
506,Trang D,4,"As a frequent flyer of Vietnam airlines, i highly recommend VNA for your trips among the other airlines here."
506,donnaleighh,3,I was flying to Bkk - Hanoi return. Vietnam Airlines provides good basic airline service. The staff are efficient and pleasant. Check in service was very good and staff were helpful in making seating arrangements etc. I had to remind them that I had priority baggage service on my ticket. <br><br>There were good inflight entertainment options however I thought that the meals were very poor and chose on my return to eat before I flew and just have a drink on board. Wine available as a drink choice as are soft drinks and tea and coffee.<br><br>Flight comfort was OK. I found the pilot communication excellent on both flights that I took.<br><br>I have not flow on longer haul flights with Vietnam Airways but think from my experience I might look at other options for flights over 3-4 hours.
507,omo31,5,We took several internal flights in Vietnam and would’ve flown from Australia to Vietnam if it was an option. The staff were fabulous offering a soft drink or water on the flight even though it was only 1.5 hours and on the 2 ish hour flight from Hanoi to ho Chi min we had a meal. Although there were only 2 options it was a delicious meal. The seats in the plane had more room than other airlines would definitely fly again with them.
507,Hez,3,I booked this airline as I had read some good reviews.  However on both trips they ran out of meal options by the time they got to us (and we weren’t even at the back of the plane) and we were left with the awful meal option which shouldn’t have been a meal - it was dreadful and I normally like aeroplane food. The aircon was working properly which made it uncomfortable. However the stewards were very nice.
507,Gerry C,3,"Flew with this airline twice whilst on our recent Vietnam holiday, good flights good prices and no complaints"
507,blackeaglejim,5,"The early Vietnam Airlines flight from Hanoi to the Central Highlands city of Pleiku departs at 7:20 and arrives in Pleiku about an hour and a half later.  If the weather is relatively good it's a good time of day to fly, for you get a wonderful view of the Highlands scenery, its hills, rivers, villages and cities, accented by morning mists and low-lying clouds.  Upon landing, it's a short tril to Pleiku city, or you can continue to Kin Tum, just a half-hour by taxi."
507,Minh_Hai_BN,4,"Vietnam Airline (VNA) just opened the direct flight to Sydney. So It saved a lot times compared to others airlines when I departed from Hanoi. Actually, I could not find the differences in economy class between this time and previous times (with ThaiAirway or Singapore Airline). The seat is quite comfortable and there is a touch screen with many entertainment programs (new movies, new song collections...but not many game options). VNA staff are also friendly, they are young and always smile (but from my experience, this good attitude does not always show in all VNA flights). VNA serves 2 meals during flight and the food is quite delicious. If you feel thirsty, you can request a bottle of water ,which is a plus (when I flied with Thaiairway, they just provided me a cup of water)"
508,Sydneysider2011_12,4,"Good service and clean cabin as what other say. Air host are friendly enough, cabin is good, also use their service to Ho Chi Minh. Would say it is good enough as there is not much choice in there. Good airline."
508,Tedam,4,"Flew via HCMC to Bangkok from Sydney - my first experience with VN. The comfort was good  and service/food/entertainment was in keeping with a full service airline - but the very engaging air crew made a difference. The flight on a 787 was comfortable.<br>Drinks service is sparse and you have to ask if you want your thimble wine glass refreshed.<br>The airline provides a comfortable [very dated] lounge with refreshments for passengers with a long layover [about 5 hours or more] between flights in HCMC as I experienced on my return - very pleasant surprise, thank you.<br>I had some problems with my ticket when I checked in at Bangkok and while this was difficult and caused a delay of a day, the counter staff and supervisors were most helpful in advising on how to remedy the problem."
508,Sean L,3,"Would advise to take some food, as the meals provide are poor to say the least. Apart from that Its acceptable"
508,SweetSA,4,"We decided to go Business Class after reading some forums and I'm glad we did. It wasn't a great deal extra but the extra perks were quite good.<br><br>We checked in and were told to go up the stairs and join the 1st line in security. Well, the first line had 10 people in it and the other line was packed full of people. I think it would have taken over an hour to get through.<br><br>Once through security , we went to the Lotus lounge. I wasn't expecting anything much but it was quite modern and very clean. Free drinks fridge including beer (which made my husband happy), cold food, hot food, cakes, tea coffee, juice etc.<br><br>Lots of chairs to relax in and ports to charge phones with free wifi and clean toilets too.<br><br>I read that on some flights you have to board a shuttle to take you to the plane and it can be really hot and you are packed in. If using business class, you have a separate shuttle to the plane. Our flight just had an air bridge so we didn't experience this but did meet a lady who was very unhappy with being crammed into the shuttle in the heat.<br><br>Our flight was short, seats wide, we seemed to eat and offered drinks the whole time and then we were landing. Was a nice experience.<br><br>Our 2nd internal flight was from Danang to Hanoi. We flew economy and were asked to sit near the emergency door, so we had a lot of leg room. Seats were fine and offered a drink. We had to hop on a shuttle bus to the airport, it was pretty full but didn't feel it was too cramped. <br><br>Both flights were on time and we were really pleased with the service and flights. We would fly them again for sure."
508,GORDON O,5,"A great experience flying with Vietnam airlines, clean, comfortable and excellent friendly service at a good price"
509,Bobdally,3,This was actually a premium economy seat and as the title suggests it was the best and worst.  It is the most comfortable seat in Premium Economy I have had over quite a few airlines but they really do have to improve the food and beverage service.  The food was cold on the way out and I could not eat it.  <br>I know passengers are being encouraged to drink less on flights but when my wife asked for a gin and tonic and got half a miniature of gin topped up with half a tiny can of tonic she was quite shocked.  That is taking sobriety to extremes.
509,MLM319,4,"Very helpful staff in all transactions with them. Both ground staff and airline crews. Planes new &amp; all very comfortable.  Flat beds all around, excellent. <br>Food and drink service is great. <br>Shared business lounges in Melbourne  &amp; London. All fine. Lounge in Ho Chi Minh is only fair but hope it will be upgraded sometime. <br>Only  downside is the long stop overs in Ho Chi Minh both ways. However the airline offer a business package that allows transport,  recuperating in hotels with meals &amp; even a city tour all free. There is a minimum time frame which flights to &amp; from Australia meet to have this service. This makes the journey longer however just means you are in HCM rather than Melbourne whiling away the day. <br>The entertainment is ok, a lot if Asian movies but enough English ones to get by. <br>This is the second time we have used this airline &amp; we will use it again, fantastic value for money."
509,Sukalin,1,"Check in very slow and once I reached suvannapoom airport, i waited for my box about half and hour then i contact the staff. The staff was known that my box was not sent and ask me to wait for new flight to be delivered. They got my contact upon reservation they should call to inform. I call call center and the line was always busy. Customer service is very bad handling"
509,Anne D,4,"Very comfortable flight, had seats with extra legroom. Dreamliner plane was very spacious . Only negative was they ran out of most of of alcohol 4 hours into the flight!"
509,jeff b,5,I was most impressed with this airline. I wasn't expecting what seemed to appear to be a brand new plane. I didn't have any food on board so I cant comment on that.I would highly recommend this airline.
510,donitalloyd,5,Chose premium economy and what a great decision!  With lots of leg room and the seat reclining so much I was almost laying flat (I'm 5ft 6) which was such a blessing on a 12 hour flight as it enabled plenty of sleep and meant that we were able to spend our 1st day in Ho Chi Minh City sightseeing rather than sleeping. Food and drink service was good.  Ok selection of movies.
510,Michael N,5,A very comfortable overnight flight of 12 hours on a 787 Dreamliner. The lay flat seats are great for a sleep. Cabin crew are very attentive with efficient and friendly service.<br>Business class is worth the extra cost for a more comfortable flight plus the priority check in and priority immigration pass at Heathrow saving a lot of time.
510,Robyn j,5,"Vietnam Airlines is a fantastic airline and we use them all the time, including travelling back and forth to Australia. We find dealing with Vietnam Airlines much easier than other airlines. My only complaint is lay overs when travelling to Luang Prabang. We flew from Danang to Hanoi, then had to wait 5 hours for the next flight to Luang Prabang. On the return trip we boarded an hour late due to the plane leaving Danang late. Arrived in Hanio about 9pm, through customs and immigration and was out of the terminal about 9.45pm. Our next flight to Danang wastnt until 6am the next morning. If a plane from Danang flew directly to Luang Prabang flight time would be 2 hours, unfortunately though, they dont fly direct. Our lay over in Hanoi was about 10 hours, hence why we booked accommodation for over night. Although the tickets were inexpensive, no matter how hard I tried, even looking at other airlines there was no way to afford the lengthy lay overs. As an airline they are fantastic, except when it comes to time tables and connecting planes. Having said that, I would still travel Vietnam Airlines. Seats are comfortable, staff friendly."
510,Shaz W,4,"Check in process was very pleasant and easy.  The plane itself if on par with all the other major airlines such as BA.  The staff were pleasant and hospitable.  We ended up flying with Vietnam airlines 5 times during our trip to Vietnam and Cambodia with this airline and have no complaints at all throughout.  The only thing I would say is that when initially booking, the price offered for the same routing was more expensive if I booked directly with Vietnam Airlines - ended up being almost £200 cheaper booking through Expedia so shop around."
510,ScrapFree,4,"The aircraft was quite new and the cabin staff was surprisingly friendly. <br>This short haul flight was on time. Online check in did not work for this flight, although it shoud be possible according airline website."
511,CarlaColumna123,5,"We flew from Frankfurt, Germany to Ho Chi Minh City and from Ho Chi Minh City back to Frankfurt. Both flights in Business Class. Aircraft was Airbus A 350-900 (350); it was a wonderful experience in this extremely quiet plane. Service was amazing and very friendly. Food was very good. We will book again and can highly recommend Vietnam Airlines."
511,Chris L,4,"Although a 4.5 hour flight the service on this business class product was very good.<br><br>The seat and cabin is very good with a fully reclining seat to bed position which means you can stay sat down whilst changing recline, TV screen was very good (prob 17"") and had good film selection.<br><br>Food was nice and served with proper knife / fork but no china plates etc.<br><br>Staff are very attentive and offered drinks throughout the flight."
511,Murat Ş,4,We flight 3 times with Vietnam Airlines during the trip.<br>Staff was friendly and respectful to the all passengers.
511,paul216x,3,"Short flight from Hanoi to Vientiane, service was relatively good. Legroom was a little shorter than Usual but still ok, and plane was comfortable.<br>such an expensive flight though £110 / $150 for the 40 minutes. I was later told this is because vietnam airlines has a monopoly on this route. and the only other option is a 28 hour bus journey.<br>Other flights in SE asia of a similar distance were around half this price."
511,Bill W,4,Excellent service provided by the airline.The seats were roomy and the service was very good.i would recommend this airline.
512,Aaradamw,5,"Vietnam Airlines provides great flights from and to Australia from Vietnam. We always travel Vietnam Airlines when we travel overseas as the aircraft are world class, the Cabin Crew and friendly and efficient and the onboad food is always of a high standard."
512,SueTappy,5,"We were lucky enough to have the exit rows on our flight there and return , this was our nineth trip to Vietnam and have in the past have used other airlines on two occasions,but always come back to Vietnam airlines ,from the ground staff to the cabin crew they are more than accommodating,transit is made very easy with staff helping you all the way .<br>The only thing I would say that has let them down is the choice of inflight movies this seems to have deminshed since last year,and the flight from Ho Chi Minh to Da nang you used to be given a bottle of water ,which now has changed to a cup of water ,bad move"
512,suem030,4,"We did two legs with Vietnam air, one to Ho Chi Minh and the second from Ho Chi Minh to Paris. The food was rather disappointing with not much Vietnamese cuisine on offer, but the planes themselves were very comfortable. Staff were not particularly friendly, but were as attentive as they needed to be. <br>Entertainment was mediocre with not many new movies on offer. <br>The individual space per person was  very good and made for a comfortable flight."
512,Wai Man C,5,"We wanted to fly direct and this is the only airline that does so. My travel agent said how good they were and when I was told they used Dreamliners I thought we should use them. What a lovely flight with very good air and excellent food , it puts BA to shame I’m afraid. We would definitely try and use Vietnam air  for flights in the future ."
512,25lindab2000,5,"Flying at night is bad regardless of airline however, Vietnam Airlines ground check-in was kind to block off the middle seat for my elderly mother so she can be more comfortable, which they did to our surprise.  Staff on board were accommodating, food was better than expected, inflight had many movies &amp; films to watch without any hiccups and the take-off/landing was smooth.  The Captain was informative whenever there was turbulence and avoided where possible.  Overall, one of the better trips had coming back into Sydney."
513,RaktimRay,4,"Flying out of the new singapore airlines terminal the one bad experience I had with them was the ground staff. They were not really aware of the rules about new provisions for mobile boarding passes and the airlines were equally at fault for not letting the customers know about how boarding passes will always need to be collected at the check in counters. I faced similar mismanagement issues at Hanoi as well. But once past this inconvenience the rest of the experience was better than I expected. The treatment of passengers, the efficiency of the crew and the overall ambience made for a pretty decent trip. They do not have personal on board entertainment so load up on your netflix and music and have your earphones ready. The food was decent both in taste and quantity and considering the ticket prices are not ceiling shattering you get good returns on the dollar. Seat comfort is standard and depending on flight it may border on spartan and the front pocket space may be a bit cramped so ensure most of your stuff is tucked away in your bag under the seat. I did not use their check in services so wont be able to comment on that but apart from the ground staff experience i wouldnt mind flying with them again."
513,grant2472018,5,"Great flight, plenty of leg room, meals good. Staff were very helpful. Comfy pillow and blanket in each seat."
513,karenr4850,4,"I flew with a group of 23 from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh City and was pleasantly surprised with the both the service and conditions. I had been a bit apprehensive as I had heard some reports, but I was impressed. Flight left on time, comfortable seats, and a great take off and landing. The flight staff were very accommodating and the plane was clean and tidy. I would definitely fly with this airline again."
513,maz04,4,"We were a bit worried after reading some of the reviews on here but decided to treat it as an adventure. What a pleasant surprise. First we got exit row seats as hubby is over 6'. Then had an empty seat next to us. The flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh was fantastic. Crew couldn't be helpful enough. Smiling, friendly and we watched as a mum and Bub were looked after all the way. The facilities on board were the best we've encountered (in economy) ever! Have flown over a dozen different airlines. They were also the cleanest as crew checked regularly and seemed to do a full clean every hour. The meals were smaller than we've had on other airlines, but we didn't care as we were not really hungry. Great coffee! <br>BUT Vietnam Airlines were badly let down by ground crew. We were in a group of transit passengers and some seemed to get transit stickers whilst others didn't. We (and the other transit passengers) waited more than 40 minutes for our luggage before I accidentally saw it grouped near a pillar with a small ""transit"" sign. Many people were becoming agitated and worried because most of our onward flights were within the two and a half hour time span. ....and yes, the Airlines themselves booked these flights. Finally had to grab bags, take to transit stand where they were loaded for next flight. Then had to exit international, walk 5-8 minutes and enter domestic terminal. Again through security then on to boarding gate. Ground staff ambling around chatting. Appeared to be no proper procedure for those in transit, or if there was, this particular crew were happy to wing it. The hour long domestic flight was great. So yes, if the price is right WILL fly Vietnam Airlines again."
513,Wayne B,3,One flight was very good while the other was OK. <br>On one leg we flew on one of Vietnam Airlines new planes which was very good as we had more leg room and decent seats. <br>While on the other leg it was an older plane and felt more cramped.<br>There was really no entertainment system but rather a few small screens above some of the rows and you either watched that movie or none at all.
514,UK việt,1,"I flew from Da Lat to Ho Chi Minh City. At Ho Chi Minh I enquired about my onward flight. Vietnam Airlines said it was nothing to do with them as the flight was operated by Angkor Air. The staff were contemptuous and dismissive. Patronisingly, it was explained that the digits in the code should show me it was a code share flight. <br>So when check in opened less than thirty minutes late, I was somewhat shocked to be told that the schedule had changed and my flight would now be 8 hours later. I was given a meal voucher but that was on the other side of immigration. <br>Thankfully I did not go through but stayed in departure area. Rumours started to circulate that the later flight was overbooked. I was offered $50 to not fly but I’d already been waiting 5 hours. Suddenly at 2 pm a seat was found on Qatar airlines and so I was rushed through. To be fair the representative from Angkor Air was lovely. <br>However a $15 bus from Ho Chi Minh city would have got me there more quickly and saved me $90.<br>I was not given a free meal, a drink, clear information, compensation or even an apology during my 6 hours at the airport. <br>I arrived home, tired and stressed. The two things I’d paid to avoid."
514,nuyu2013,4,"Flight on time, crew very polite. Served a meal in flight which was 3.5 hours. No complaints and would recommend"
514,Peter V,5,"These guys were great.  All from the initial refresher towel given to the lovely hosts and hostess that served us.  They were willing to help in any way they could (from what I saw from other passengers asking for assistance).  Always smiling and always courteous.<br><br>The food was very good which is a hard thing to achieve when it comes to airline food.  I tend to get a bit dry in the throat on flights but asking for an extra beverage was often met with a smile and a ""One moment please!"" which seemed to only take a few seconds.<br><br>I mean come on, even when checking in for your flight the check in staff would all line up outside their desks and bow to everyone before checking us all in.....how classy is that.<br><br>The next time I head over to Vietnam (which wont be too long hopefully) I'll be using them again."
514,Judi P,4,"Always travel with Vietnam Airlines to Vietnam. The service is good &amp; it's a direct flight, wouldn't fly any other way."
514,Knocknagow15,5,"I’m a little embarrassed to say that I was nervous of our flights and what to expect particularly as I was influenced by some of the negative comments that I had read as well as friends saying how wonderful there “big” name long haul flights had been with other carriers.However given I mistakenly thought I didn’t need a visa as being Irish and a member of the EU to visit Vietnam - yes I get I was stupid,my total shock was clear at the booking in desk at terminal 4 however the amazing vietnamise airlines team supported me brilliantly and helped me sort an emergency visa- massive thank you ,so a bitter sweet start ! The actual flight in economy was really good plenty to eat good leg room and once again fantastic air/cabin crew so supportive I’ve read on trip advisor about how there manners can be questioned? The only question I have is how that they can keep up such a good service and a plesent attitude all the way Since that flight we have had 3 internal flights with the carriers all around an hour , once again all really comfortable,well organised and regular updates when one of the flights was delayed - a very big thank you and I hope when we fly back to the UK on Saturday it’s definitely more of the same"
515,Chris K,4,"Check-in was fast and easy. Smooth journey. Simple snack of rice crackers was offered. No drama, which is good enough for me."
515,Joanne W,5,"We traveled SYD - HCMC - HANOI - DA NANG - SYD and loved it. The flights and service were great. We applied for an upgrade with Option Town and received an upgrade to Premium Economy on the Sydney flights. For $120 we thought it was worth it, especially for the red eye flight home and the bonus is if you don't receive the upgrade you get your money back... so it was a win win for us. We applied for a Business upgrade on the morning of our internal flight Da Nang - HCMC for $50 and upon arrival at the airport it was granted. This was probably not really worth it for a 1hr flight, but nice to fly Business when you can. The staff at the airport were great in helping us with our upgrade and directing us to our connecting flight."
515,Mary Jane A,5,"Easy check in, departed and arrived on time with my free checked luggage being offloaded quickly......all good!<br>So tired though can't remember anything about food and entertainment."
515,Phil S,4,We flew with Vietnam Airlines as a family with 2 children and found it to be a good airline. Customer service at Heathrow airport was excellent and a question about our pre booked seating was resolved by moving us to a better position on the plane. In flight entertainment and food was ok but nothing out of the ordinary for long haul economy flights.
515,jockeygirl,1,"Purchased an economy ticket Sydney-Paris return having flown with them on many trips, the last 2 trips really changed my mind to travel with them again.<br>It took 36 hours travel time and 4 sectors Sydney- Saigon- Hanoi-Paris and 2 transfers Saigon and Hanoi where we were left to find our own way to the Domestic Airports where we had to get a visa to cross the road and no gate direction and the 2nd a shuttle where we weren’t told where to catch the bus.<br>We were given meals that were Luke warm on their Dreamliners and no choice of food at all and one a breakfast Hanoi-Paris full of Europeans a Chicken dish with warped vegetables, bottled water was Luke warm throughout the trip.<br>On the return flight we have a stop over of 15 hours where we were denied the transit Tour and not even provided meals<br><br>Here is the reply from Vietnam Airlines on Facebook <br>The special meals of Luke just serve in the Business class at the moment."
516,Lisa1970red,5,Best flight I’ve ever had in fact <br>My connecting flight was late they couldn’t have been more helpful <br>They overrode the system to let us on <br>How they got our bags on was nothing short of a miricle yet they did <br>Staff lovely <br>Trip comfortable <br>We even flew internally with them and they put our domestic airlines to shame <br>I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them
516,Matthew S,5,"Whilst staying in Ho Chi Minh City as a base, we thought we would look at seeing another part of a Vietnam by having a short flight to Danang, followed with hotel transport to Hoi An.<br>The flight was reasonably priced and service couldn’t be faulted. We had heard that sometimes there were delays in the return journey to Ho Chi Minh City but luckily that wasn’t our experience. (Apparently this can occur if a major dignitary is landing there).<br>Next trip to Vietnam, we will probably use Vietnam Air again to fly even further north.<br>It is probable that they will soon have direct flights in and out of Perth and that will cut out plane transfers and shorten the whole trip by a significant amount."
516,John v,4,"We flew with this airbus A321 from Cam Ranh (Nha Trang) to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Check in went smooth. Except that the girl at the check in was not the smartest. She first gave me seat nr 18.. I asked her for another seat in the rear part of of the aircraft. She  then gave me seat nr 14. i didnt want to respond to that so i accepted that seat. Because of her poor english she didnt understand what i meant. Boarding started exactly at 10.15am. That went smooth. We were transported by bus to the aircraft. Push back was at 10.55 am and we took off at 11.05 am. <br><br>There was no inflight entertainment but there was an inflight magazine, partly in Vietnamese and partly in English. Seat width and leg space were ok (for me). Because i am not that big. The seats were simply upholstered, but without head support. During this 40 minutes flight you got a bottle of water.<br><br>We landed at 11.42 am. We were transported by a bus to the arrival hall.<br>This fully booked flight went smooth. The flight attendants are friendly, correct and helpful. The toilets are kept clean.10 kilos cabin baggage and 20 kilos hold baggage per person is allowed  on this flight. If you need more kilos, than its better you buy them in advance."
516,Cathie M,4,"The journey involved two flights; each took 45 minutes. There was no food or beverage service.The first flight was from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City; the flight left and arrived on time. We experienced difficulty at HCM airport because we had to pick up luggage and shift terminals. We had a hard time finding the Vietnam Air counter, and when we finished checking in there, we had more than an hour wait in the security line. Would have missed our flight if it hadn't left late. For the return journey, we reversed the two flights. Both left and arrived on time. Everything was fine, but I did not like that we were unable to select seats ahead of time."
516,Ross,4,Great service from both ground and aircrew of Vietnam Airlines. Had issues with our bags (not VA fault) and the ground crew went all out to ensure both us and our bags made the flight on time.  The leg room was surprisingly generous.
517,Megsy333,5,"If travelling to SE Asia and Vietnam Airlines flies to your destination make sure you fly with them. <br>Recently did 5 flights with this carrier to Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos , 2 on the new Dreamliner. What a great trip we had. On time , super service and good prices. <br>Definitely recommend"
517,Val M,4,"Was served lunch meal within 90mins of boarding then breakfast approx 9hrs later. No tea, coffee or light refreshments in between."
517,simon_zandberg,4,"We flew domestically between Ho Chi Minh and Nha Trang (Cam Ranh) and had no issues with those flights as it's merely 40 minutes of flying time.<br><br>However, the Boeing 787 flights between Melbourne and Ho Chi Minh were both very uncomfortable. The leg room in economy class was fine but the location of the entertainment, light and attendant controller on the top of the arm rest is just ridiculous!<br>Perhaps it's just a Boeing design but on an 8 hour flight when you're trying to watch a movie, listen to music or play a game and your elbow more than occasionally rests on the controller and causes annoying pauses or even ruins the game you're in the middle of, it becomes really annoying!<br>Again, it's not the airline's fault but when you're already uncomfortable sitting on a plane for hours and restricted for room, it just makes matters worse by having to rest your elbow on the arm rest in a position that's not ideal.<br>I noticed several flight attendant lights on above some of the rows ahead of me, most likely because others had pressed the button unwittingly with their elbows.<br><br>The staff on the airline - in all four of our flights - were quite robotic, cold and even lacked common courtesy.<br>This was quite surprising given the opposite is true on all other airlines I've flown with.<br><br>The food was acceptable. A couple of meals very quite nice; a couple not.<br><br>Premium economy is much better in terms of room and apparently the food too and for the extra few dollar, I will fly this class next time.<br><br>One of the most annoying parts of the flight is the Vietnam Airlines advertisement being played a second time during the flight, about an hour before landing and while everyone is either listening to music, watching a movie, playing a game or sleeping.<br>None of this was possible as your screen is locked onto the ad and the sound is at full volume throughout the plane during the ad's 10 minute duration!!!<br>I couldn't even hear my companion talking to me from the next seat!<br>You cannot even switch off your own TV.<br>Given we already watched this ad that's almost as long as a documentary, at the commencement of the flight and given we've paid and already on the plane, we shouldn't have to be tortured by being rudely interrupted and forced to watch and listen to it again at a time when we certainly need our space on the flight more than at any other.<br>This kind of advertising is disgraceful and bordering on physical assault.<br><br>Domestically within Vietnam, Vietnam Airlines is certainly still a far better option than Jetstar Asia and Viet Jet.<br>Jetstar Asia caused us hell the last time we were in Vietnam."
517,Pent00,5,"Although this was a short flight the plane was good, clean, more leg room then in other flights we've flown and staff were friendly. Check in and security was efficient the plane left early and our bags arrived. We had heard that Vietnam Airlines is often  delayed or will cancel with no real reason. This did not happen with us. As the cost of flying within Vietnam is very inexpensive I would recommend it  as an option for longer distances."
517,Andy P,5,Great service from the time we boarded the plane was clean and comfortable the food was nice and fresh arrive on time as  always.
518,ANL63,5,"There was not the first time I flew to London and Europe. <br>There are lots of airlines which serve the South East Asia - Europe routes.<br>I always choose Vietnam Airlines when traveling in this itinerary.  <br>Direct flight is the most important advantages of taking flight with Vietnam Airlines for this route.<br>In this route, VNA offers only large and modern aircrafts, that makes your trip more comfortable.<br>Regarding the price, it is comparable (or a bit cheaper) with the other airlines which serve this itinerary. So, in this case, direct and comfortable become the most important issues.<br>The service is OK, if you are in economy.<br>Have to note that if you travel with premium economy, the service becomes excellent.<br>One more issue should be added: Vietnam airlines offers 13 DIRECT flights weekly between Paris  CDG and HCMC, the same frequent between Frankfurt and HCMC (direct as well), and 5 direct flights weekly between London and HCMC. So, you have a large range of flight to choose."
518,Megan S,4,"We flew a few flights with Vietnam Airlines on the way to and from Vietnam and had a good experience on all of them. The staff were friendly and polite. The legroom was reasonable (not huge but no knees jammed up against the seat in front). The food was tasty (as much as airplane food can be) and not too much of it so you don’t feel like you’ve over eaten. The movie selection was okay, not as good as other airlines such as Air New Zealand or Emirates though. Not a flash airline but very good for getting from A to B."
518,Cocko22,5,What a relief when my 2 sons and I were offered the emergency seats. My sons are both over 6’2” and were very grateful to have the extra leg room. Fantastic to see staff observant and creating a much better flying experience for our family. Thank you Vietnam Airlines.
518,Paul E,4,"We flew Premium Economy, our first time with Vietnam Airlines. <br><br>The seat comfort, pitch and general space was the best we have experienced in this class and well worth the upgrade cost. <br><br>Food was a bit disappointing. There was a choice of mains for both dinner and for breakfast but there was nothing exceptional about any of the dishes. No problem with the quality of the food but no better than 3/5 and no better than I would expect in economy.   <br><br>Sandwiches and instant noodles were also available at any time upon request. We didn’t sample these. <br><br>Alcoholic drinks were replenished on request, no problem and water was plentiful throughout the flight. <br><br>Service from the crew was efficient, polite and responsive, but not quite up to the level of Singapore, Etihad and the other 5 star airlines. More functional than spectacular. <br><br>The aircraft was clean, modern and on time! Toilets were regularly monitored for cleanliness and supplies. Our experience was identical on the return flight (VN55). <br><br>I can’t state positively enough the excellent comfort of the seats, which recline substantially, (I slept for almost half of the flight, which is amazing for me) and I have no hesitation in recommending Vietnam Airlines based on this trip, especially Premium Economy."
518,GospodinPerfilyev,1,"There was no information prior to my flight on whether I have to have a ticket out of my next destination. But perhaps I missed it and perhaps it is a rule the company can't change. Why couldn't they accept a ticket reservation (the pay later one)? Stuff at check in was forcing me to present a PAID ticket out of Thailand. A country that by default NEVER asks me to have a return ticket. I flew in and out before with Thai Lion Air and other airlines and Vietnam Airlines were the only ones not only to ask for another ticket but to somehow prove to them that I bought. They were super unhelpful, asking for some magical ""ticket number"". There is a flight number, there is a booking number, but there is no ticket number in existence. I am a budget traveler and this whole situation cost me more money and affected my schedule. I will never fly with VN again and to anyone flying VN to Thailand - be warned."
519,meeh,5,"When booked there wasn't a huge amount more to pay for this class compared to premium economy. Skipped supper as I wanted to get some sleep and managed a pretty comfortable 8 hours kip. If I was being picky, a little bit more seat padding would have been welcome. Staff professional and efficient without being overly smiley, which is fine by me. Breakfast was good. Flight on time. Would use this airline again. Priority passport clearance at Heathrow was welcome, only took 30 mins from leaving plane to the car (this is a record!). Only negatives were the lounge at SGN and lack of priority boarding at departure gate."
519,HappyFeet S,4,"We have always travelled business class &amp; Vietnam Airlines have been consistently good.  Clean &amp; new so everything was working! Crew looked after us very well. We are a family of 4 with young kids.  Kids were arranged through travel agent to have kids meals but after seeing the menu thought that it was unnecessary.  Meals were a hit &amp; miss to &amp; from. They generally arrive warm not hot but the tepid cups of tea were very average. My pho does NOT resembled the ones advertised on their airline ad - cracked me up!!!! Luke Nguyen is their current ambassador but I haven’t been able to differentiate the quality of food before &amp; after him... This entire trip, the cabin air was considerably warm which is unusual.  Both my husband &amp; I felt clammy &amp; sweaty when we arrived at our destinations. Thus, the blanket &amp; socks were unnecessary. The lady behind me was using the menu as a fan for most of the trip. Whereas I was using the wet cold face washer &amp; drinking lots of water to stay rehydrated."
519,espositosilvio,2,"The main reason I choose Vietnam Airline and not a low cost was the company and the service she can provide. To be honest I was not impressed at all. First we were late of 1 hour. Inside the plane, the AC was not working when the plane was on the parking. We had no informations about this delay. The team crew was completely disorganized during the service for the dinner. Before this flight I had a flight to Maldives with Scoot Airline and I was really impress by the staff, the informations, the plane, the seats ....First time for me Vietnam Airline and for sure last time."
519,Geoff G,5,Fantastic service and food all the way - totally enjoyed the 8.5hrs or so in Business Class. Especially loved the soup 🍲. Would definately fly again.
519,anaplas,2,Flew Premium economy to and from Vietnam.. Plane was a Dreamliner and premium seats were very comfortable. Food was very poor and lukewarm so virtually unedible. Staff distant and unfriendly. Lack of service - one glass of wine offered in a 12 hour flight ! everything seems to be an inconvenience. Wouldn't fly with them out of choice again or recommend
520,sandilong1511,4,VA provided us with a great flying experience.  We booked premium economy  The food going over excellent which was a day flight but the food coming back  (a night flight) was not so good especially the breakfast served towards the end.  I could not eat the eggs which were so dry my fork could stand up in it.   There were a couple of glitches as when we tried to change our flights at Da Nang airport were were told there were no seats available yet when we went on line there were seats.  It did cost us some extra money but we were prepared to pay the $50AUD to change flights home.  There is a large selection of movies etc to choose from with head sets provided. <br>  Plenty of leg room and the Premium Economy seats were very comfortable.<br> The seat configuration in PE is 2  3  2 so a couple might prefer the two seats alone. Overall the airline are one of the best I've flown on.
520,Maria Pia,5,"This is my first review of an airline. I have flown with them twice now. I was so impressed by the service both times. The food was alright. Check in was a breeze, &amp; on-board service was classy. Flights were on time. When flying domestic you will find a few options, trust it, book ahead for better fares and pay the extra over the others."
520,Leonieke v,4,"We should keep it a secret<br>But... we bought the extra seat option via option town and were lucky to have 2 whole rows for the 2 of us! Therefore had a very comfy flight on our way to vietnam. Highly recommended<br><br>The downside was an hour delay, a missed connection and no response yet to my email for a reimbursement/compensation. <br><br>Otherwise they do well"
520,Bella C,3,As this was a flight of only 85 minutes there is not much to review but I would say that the check-in was smooth and easy; the flight was on time; the flight attendants were efficient; seats fairly comfortable.<br>In flight service consisted of a bottle of water!
520,Ozziemovers,5,I am now a confirmed VN business traveller after years of <br>over paying on the likes of Qantas and Emirates. Occasionally some of the seat hardware needs attention such as seats not working or arm rests broken but in four recent long haul flights this was on one flight only and I was moved on request. Food and beverage always good and noodles available throughout the flight.<br>Better English would be useful for cabin crew but I have always found them courteous and responsive. At approx 50% of alternative airline pricing it's a no brainer.
521,BenitoAndersoni,5,This flight (VN 780) started in the Qantas Business Lounge in Melbourne with all the usual trimmings. The aircraft was a near new 787-9 Dreamliner and was a delight to be in. The food and service were exemplary. Note however no sky bridge use in HCMC airport. Business class passengers were whisked away in their own air conditioned bus to the terminal.
521,Anniquelee L,2,"The service was not very friendly and the flight attendants were so bloody serious and unwelcoming. I know that most of these flights are short but really we are still paying customers......so how about some friendly, welcoming service Guys?"
521,Kalo_Chorio,5,First time we have travelled in business class with full length beds. What a difference that makes. It was the first time I have been able to sleep on a plane. The staff were very friendly and catered for every need. The food was very good with a mixture of Asian and European choices.
521,Diane W,3,The flight was satisfactory but my case checked in at Hanoi to Sydney had a corner ripped off so now unusable. Tried to talk to customer service but they said it was out of a time limit. I had been trying to claim through insurance.
521,MichaelGorter,1,"Our flight was almost halfway to Dong Hoi when we had to turn around and return to Hanoi because of technical problems. I understand this happens occasionally, but the airline should ensure their planes are in flying condition prior to takeoff. What made matters far worse is that the airline employee in the Hanoi airport didn’t know what to do with us, so we were forced to stand around for well over an hour waiting to hear about a replacement flight. None of the employees spoke English to answer questions either. Finally, they told us there would be a flight the next morning and brought us to a sketchy hotel for the night, but informed us that we should wait in the lobby for comfirmation. After another hour (late at night my now), they changed the story and said there would be no flight tomorrow morning and “maybe” one tomorrow evening, but they could take us on an 8 hour bus ride instead. So we took the bus (far worse quality/less legroom than the ones we took in Cambodia), which turned out to be 12 hours, and finally arrived in Dong Hoi. Overall, a terrible experience made worse by poor communication. Oh and no refund of any kind on the flight of course..."
522,Colleen C,4,"Flew Vietnam Airlines from Ho Chi Minh City to Melbourne Australia it was a direct flight <br>The flight itself I couldn’t fault however the meals were average<br>We had an overnight flight leaving Vietnam around 9.30pm we were served Dinner about 40 minutes after take off<br>We had no selection there was no choice <br>We were also served Breakfast which was also a hot Vietnamese breakfast which neither of us ate, by this stage we were starving <br>Apparently there were cup noodles on board which we didn’t even find out about until it was too late <br>No menu was given to us<br>Was offered drinks only twice and given one bottle of water (however we could have asked for more)<br>40kgs of luggage each was very generous <br>Would fly with them again however leaving Vietnam I would definitely take snacks"
522,Delfin F,4,"We had no knowledge about Vietnam Airlines before traveling to Viet Nam, which made us apprehensive about booking the flights with them.  But, we booked all the flights within Viet Nam (3) plus the international flight out of Vietnam from (Hanoi to Bangkok) and were happily surprise about the quality of the airline.  All the flights were on time,  when traveling in business you have preferential check in, fast track at the security and immigration areas (very helpful!!), lounges at the airports (domestic and International) and friendly efficient service. When travelling in business class,  if there is a bus service to or from the airplane, they will provided for a separate couch,  very convenient!!<br>We loved our experience in this wonderful country and its people and will return...without any doubts about flying Vietnam Airlines in the future!!"
522,Val_Mansfield,3,"i had a aisle seat and the legroom was acceptable, I'm 1.88 metres.    The in flight magazine was surprisingly good reading.<br><br>The meal was more than acceptable.<br><br>We were away on time and landed early.   Our second flight with Vietnam Airlines and we would fly them again."
522,Nic D,1,"Had to fly with them unfortunately. Took quite a long time to be able to book on their web site that seems to be stuck in the 1980s. They then sent me an email to check in on line. Went to the link, filled in all the details and then at the end told me I could not!!! Now at the airport the line for check in is massive, unorganised and badly managed. The flight itself was late and old"
522,Doug D,5,"The agent at Hanoi airport, whose name I wish I knew, was knowledgable, efficient, and helpful beyond what I would have expected. The flight was great, the aircraft (Boeing 787) was in great shape, and the crew did a very nice job throughout.<br>As a retired airline captain, I gladly recommend flying with Vietnam Airlines."
523,Jean C,4,"Like Toshhusky we travelled Premium too. Unlike him I would not agree 'to excellent in every way'. Yes to the seats and worth the money for the extra room but not so happy with the food, have flown with other airlines in 'cattle class' with better food and felt the crew were not all that friendly."
523,Trung N,5,"Standards are good, good value.<br>The staff is friendly and helpful. Good Food &amp; Drinks served on flight. The In flight entertainment system is awesome and keeps you engaged all along. Excellent choices of movies old/new..."
523,ToshHusky,5,"We actually travelled Premium Economy but the selection isn't available above.<br>The airline was excellent in every way.<br>From check in to the service on board, to the comfort of the seats.<br>Much larger chairs with lots of room between rows.    Recline considerably further than economy.    The food was great and we had our own section of toilets.<br>Would highly recommend this airline and would certainly travel with them again.<br>Also, we travelled on a Dreamliner.   Great aircraft."
523,jrzygrl1954,5,"We had no idea about this airline, as it was booked as part of package through a travel agent.  More than a pleasant surprise.  Service was exceptional, well organized and the food was very good."
523,Rowan,2,My partner and I got 4 different flights with Vietnam Airlines and 3 out of the 4 were delayed due to technical error. Staff were friendly and the flights were comfortable.
524,Tracey-Ann B,5,"WOW....Was not expecting such excellent service from an airline. The seats were very comfortable, leg room grand, meals good, service friendly. They only issue we had was in Paris when we went to check-in for our return flight Vietnam Airline staff told us to stand aside &amp; let another flight check-in first - resulting in us almost missing our flight despite being there 4 hours in advance. Paris airport was a little different with security &amp; train to terminals, once onboard Vietnam Airlines however the drama faded away, the flight was great. Would recommend Vietnam Airlines, and with language being a barrier next time at the airport I would just say I'm checking In."
524,SuamiIstri,5,"We tried Vietnam Airlines and was very happy as it turns out this is very good airlines.<br>The staffs are very friendly to make our journey easy. When we checked in, they put priority on our luggage, and it comes out very quick. <br>So nice of the staff to do that."
524,KrissiVtravelnut,4,"I wouldn't say this is the best business class but for the price you pay I was completely happy with the flight.<br><br>I flew 3 x business and 1 x Premium Economy on a recent trip.<br><br>For the price of the business class I can't stress enough how nice it us to have a place to fully stretch out your legs. When sitting up or semi reclined, I found the seats comfortable, however, in the flat bed mode it wasn't the most comfortable and I tossed and turned trying to get comfortable. Still much better than flying economy even with the best airlines.<br><br>The supper service had plenty of food and drinks, I felt spoilt and well taken care of. The main course on both supper meals was a miss for me, the first was dry and the second flight I didn't like the flavour. But keep in mind there is plenty of food, even if you skip the main. I enjoyed the appetizer and desserts on both night flights. And the breakfast on both flights was good too. I also like that the menu varies.<br><br>I was very happy with the customer service.<br><br>At this price I would keep flying business with Vietnam Airlines. If the price increases I would try out other airlines."
524,Zoe,3,"Flight was fine- really just what to expect from a mid range airline.<br>No problems or delays, no frills but not below standard either."
524,samurai-sushi-sake,5,"I used Vietnam Airlines for a total of 6 times on my 16 day journey. Every experience with this airlines was wonderful. The kind treatment, courtesy and service were outstanding. This was the way American plan service was lonf time ago. The staff and service was superior."
525,DMelb,3,"I chose to travel Premium Economy with Vietnam Airlines, simply because it was only $200 or so more than the cheapest Economy ticket at the time I booked my flight. <br>And, given I'd previously travelled in the business section of both Scoot and Jetstar flights, thought it would be about on a par with them, despite costing a fair whack more. <br>In terms of legroom, absolutely it was. 42"" pitch meant plenty of space to stretch out. <br>Beyond that, it was a decidedly 'economy' experience. <br>With Jetstar's premium offering, you get fast pass through customs/immigration, priority boarding and a glass of sparkling wine (or juice, water) on boarding. <br>With Vietnam Airlines', you get a moist towelette in a packet. <br>The food offering too was distinctly lacking; an economy class meal presented with plastic cutlery and covered in foil... nothing premium about it whatsoever. <br>(I don't eat pork and on the return journey, I was repeatedly asked which of the two breakfast options I'd like, despite the fact that both contained pork. When I said I couldn't eat them because I don't eat pork, the hostess asked, ""what about the other one?"" ""That also contains pork."" That went back and forth for a couple of minutes as she didn't understand. Suffice to say, I didn't have breakfast).<br>The entertainment options too, were very limited, so I ended up playing some games on my mobile phone for much of the flight. Thank goodness for the USB port at the side of the screen.<br>On arrival into Ho Chi Minh Airport (which should be avoided at all costs), the plane was parked on the tarmac. The business class passengers were first off and were bussed to the terminal in a swanky coach. Us Premium passengers were next; herded onto the traditional airport buses. But because we were first on, we were last off, as the Economy passengers piled on afterwards. <br>As for the airport itself... that's a whole other story.<br>So Premium? If you want a bigger seat towards the front of the plane, sure. <br>Everything else that accompanies it, however, is decidedly not so."
525,rogerw109,4,This is the first time we have flown with Vietnam Airlines going to Vietnam and then on to Australia and return. The planes were very modern and comfortable even in economy class. What set this airline apart for me was the professionalism and courtesy of the cabin crew. The ladies were very elegant in traditional dress and the men equally smartly turned out. The crew were very efficient and organised. The food was good and a mix of Vietnamese and western. The in flight entertainment is a mix of Asian and Western to cater for all passengers and therefore does not provide such an extensive programme as other western airlines. Will definitely travel with them again.
525,rgunasekera,5,We enjoyed the flight as the seats were spacious.  They were Very comfortable.  Food experience was not great but this may have been due to my own personal preference.   Wd felt safe as taking off and landing was smooth.
525,480michael,4,My change around  from Ethiopian  was less that five hours sleep before I was heading out of the door to Vietnam  I plumped for a direct flight in economy plus.first time ever with these people.service could not have been better.
525,Bill E,4,Good comfortable and smooth flight. Just that we did not got any luggage charges.It is an older plane that is similar to the plane we have in the US.
526,Tony57plus,4,"My wife and I did a 21 day Indochina tour which took in Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam and all our flights were with Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>We found the service very good and the flight attendants friendly.<br><br>The food was normal airline food, some bland and other had some good flavour."
526,gayeslade,5,Staff were very helpful and pleasant.<br>Journey was pleasant and easy<br>Good value for money<br>We returned to Sydney with Vietnam Airlines and it was the same<br>Also two internal flights were great too<br>Ground staff were courteous and pleasant<br>Would use again
526,Adris S,5,What can i say but WOW the service we received was fantastic the meals were great and they could not do enough for you i was so impressed you got a bag on each seat which contained slippers a toothbrush the planea were modern will definitely use Vietnam Airlines again
526,druidstone,4,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines as they were the only airline to offer a direct flight from London to Ho Chi Minh City. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. We were offered a discounted upgrade to Premium Economy because economy was sold out for our return flight which we took up and were so glad we did. The seats are very roomy and comfortable and helped with sleeping for most of the flight. I was disappointed that Premium Economy didn't also include Priority Boarding (our checked-in luggage had Priority tags put on them - I don't know what that was for as they came through at the same time as all the others). The food was OK but not great and they were a bit stingy with the wine, pouring from a bottle into a small glass rather than the miniatures I've had on every other airline I've flown with. The cabin staff were friendly and helpful. I would fly with them again."
526,M M,5,I flew with this airline and was ver6 impressed.  We upgraded to premium economy and had loads of room.  The seats were comfortable and roomy.  The food was good and the staff were lovely. There was plenty of legroom and plenty of films to watch.<br>Check in was efficient. It is a while since I flew long haul but this was certainly the best.
527,Vasilis D,5,I travel around the world and maybe i have been in more than 300-350 flights. Vietnam airlines are 5 star airlines !!! Thank you.
527,vicees,3,This journey was marred by very poor service on the ground.  In flight was average.<br>Vegetarian food was not edible.  Staff had poor handle on the English language.
527,vicees,4,It was a Dreamliner and the leg room was better than standard planes.<br><br>Service on ground and in flight was reasonable. There is a minor problem with communication as the flight crew are not fully trained in English. Food was OK and alcohol was also provided but was limited.
527,Oanh_TX,4,"Due to my business, sometimes i have to take flight from Hanoi to other big cities in Vietnam. I often choose to take Vietnam Airlines, a National Carriage and in generalm It is ok for me when using their services. Vietnam Airlines should teach cabin crew to give a Natural smile, and give more smile to passenger. in SUmmer, hygenece supervisor should pay more attention to cleaniless of the plance, sometimes i still smell food on My flights."
527,Bob B,1,"On a flight from Hanoi to Mandalay, Myanmar we had a change of planes in Bangkok which required we go thru Customs.  Our flight left 20 mins late from Hanoi.  Bangkok airport is HUGE, especially if you need to go from one end to the other.  Our initial flight plan had a 1 hour layover.  When we arrived in Bangkok we had no info of the gate for our next flight &amp; knew making the flight would be tight.  We looked for gate agents advising us how to get to our next gate. We noticed 2-3 agents holding signs for other flights, none with our flight.  Once we cleared Customs and heade to our gate we arrived too late.  We looked for some help &amp; a Vietnam rep came to meet us.  He took us to pick up our luggage &amp; then to the Vietnam Air desk.  They informed us that they were only responsible to book us on their next flight (next day), provide a hotel &amp; a meal.  We missed meeting our tour guide in Mandalay &amp; a day of the tour.  They told us they had someone at the gate in Bangkok but we must have missed her.  Really??  How, then, did they somehow know we were going to miss the flight &amp; how did our luggage not make the flight to Mandalay???  The answer is quite obvious.   They lied...."
528,bruiser53,4,Counter staff were very helpful and inflight crew polite and friendly throughout. In flight meals were reasonable with alcohol available throughout. Inflight movies could do with an upgrade to later releases with easy to navigate screen selections. Would certainly use them again.
528,746jeff,3,"Friendly Steward and stewardess . Flight on schedule, and value for money.<br>Sitting cover looks ‘old’ with sufficient leg room. Good arriving time in Hanoi<br>With traffic not very congested while travelling to Hotel. Will definite take this <br>flight again."
528,Flying Dutchman,5,"We took Vietnam Airlines flight from Hue to Hanoi as the price is cheaper than the train for the same stops. They offered proper meal even for a 55 minutes flight. The check-in was smooth, the staff was kind and helpful and tried to help us in that short amount of time. The leg space is enough for that short and cheap service, the take off and landing was quite easy. It was a great flight for a low-cost airline."
528,575MarkT,5,"What a great economy product. Modern and fairly new airbus aircraft, good cabin condition but best of all is the seats. <br><br>As a bench mark, Much better than BA. Wider, more padding and much more legroom. All in all, a really good economy product and they don’t charge you extra for drinks !!!<br><br>The British Airways executive should take a good look and remind them selves what a good economy product looks like.<br><br>Would not hesitate to recommend flying on these guys. Great product, Asian service levels and new modern aircraft."
528,David T,5,Vietnam airlines Premium economy offers wide seating personalised service and comfort.<br>From fast track check in to the comfort packs I could not fault the trip<br>Will travel again
529,Expl0rer007,1,"DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE; they have no regard for customer convenience or service.<br><br>In September 2017, we booked the 07.45 flight from Hanoi-Dong Hoi on 30 March 2018 with them and paid our fares.  On 9 March, just three weeks before we were due to fly with them, we were informed of a delay in take-off (owing to operational reasons, of course!) till 10.25.  As we had a full itinerary arranged from Dong Hoi, and people meeting us at the airport there, we had to contact our ground agent to see how this change might affect us AND HIM before confirming the acceptability of this change.  A little adjustment, but no real problem.  We accepted.<br><br>On 27 March, just 72 hours before we were due to fly, this Vietnam Airlines bunch contacted us again with another schedule change, this time not departing until 18.00 on 30 March, seven-and-a-half hours later than the change made just over a fortnight before and over ten hours later than the original timing we had booked in good faith and paid our money for last September.  Again, it was for the catch-all 'operational reasons'.  I was mystified.<br><br>Quite how and why the national flag-carrier flying from the capital (not the busiest airport in the galaxy) on a domestic flight had to make such draconian changes from an early morning flight to an evening flight at such increadibly short notice was beyond me.  These changes were now going to take an entire day out of our planned itinerary; so, once again, I had to contact the ground agent.  Once more, he had to make some changes, but, with judicious planning, assured us we could still accommodate our plan.  Fine, and so we accepted the change again.<br><br>Owing to the fact we now had an unplanned extra day in Hanoi, I left the hotel early on 30 March, the day of departure, to visit a museum.  At 09.30, I was contacted there by my ground agent who had not been instrumental in booking the flight, but whom I had copied quite by chance on to my earlier e-mails to Vietnam Airlines.  Vietnam Airlines had been in touch with him to notify me of the cancellation of the entire flight!!!  No reason given.<br><br>All they offered was a refund of the original payment: no recompense for the fact they had potentially dented our entire trip plans.  There were no vacancies on their flights for the next few days.  Did they care?  It was quite obvious from the series of increasingly manic delays we had experienced that, owing to either incompetence or the fact they had insufficient take-up for this flight, they had decided on this summary cancellation.  <br><br>Fortunately, we were using a superb ground agent (V-explore - see my review of them under Hanoi) who not only gave me this bad news, but had a Plan B for us by using another airline, Vietjet (left on time, arrived on time).  Admittedly, it meant we had to fly to Hue, some four hours south of our original destination, necessitating a long drive back north, but at least we should be back on schedule that day.  We agreed he would book it for me (remember, I was in a museum, twenty minutes away from my hotel and my i-pad) and I would repay him later.  The flight left Hanoi in three hours.  I had to leg it back to the hotel, where our taxi collected us and we made it in-time for that Vietjet fight, again in part because our great ground agent checked us in.<br><br>No thanks to Vietnam Airlines, who could not have cared less, we got back on schedule, though at some considerable inconvenience.<br><br>However, I regret to say that even after the holiday was over, to add insult to injury, the fell hand of this airline was to be experienced as, owing to the currency exchange rate on my credit card, I lost out on the refund.  So, I lost money for a flight that this so-called airline never had the decency to undertake.<br><br>We are probably going to return to Vietnam to see the south in a year or two.  I shall be booking with Vietjet for all internal flights, and will never use Vietnam Airlines again.<br><br>DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE.  YOU CANNOT TRUST THEM.  THEY ARE WITHOUT HONOUR AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PASSENGERS."
529,morganjacob924,5,Great service and great food. The airlines don't have too much entertainment such as Thai Airways but it's enough.<br>The pho in the business class is really great comparing to other Vietnamese restaurant in the UK
529,benew,5,"VN Airline has been improved its services, better than before. The flight attendance was nice, friendly and professional. Love it and highly recommend."
529,Robert L,4,"Excellent service, flights were on time, new plane overall great experience. The only negative was that they ran out of my food selection, which normally happens on Qantas flights, but I didn’t expect it on Vietnam airlines especially when there were only 10 people in business."
529,Meredith M,5,"Flew return from Sydney to Hanoi.  Both the day time and overnight flights were great.  Planes were spotless, lots of legroom, acceptable food and peasant professional staff.  Will definitely fly with them again."
530,JLM3080,3,"This was an efficient flight, but was a densified A321 aircraft (A614) with much less leg room than the pervious A321 to Hue, the onboard service was fine, punctuality was good, but leg room was an issue"
530,carol p,5,"This airline was excellent. Staff very helpfull and food great. The movies and music selection needs updating, but that is minor. Would recommend highly."
530,JLM3080,4,"1st VN flight and was pleasantly surprised. it wasn't a good start with bus boarding from an air bridge, hence 200 people trying to get up A321 air stairs, but on board it was quite nice, lots of legroom (A608), and pleasant crew. The arrival process was far better than the departure. Recommended"
530,Davidholiday2017,5,Flew with Vietnam airlines and from start to finish the service was excellent. Friendly staff. Being able to lie flat on a bed to sleep is great. Food and drink very good on board the plane but also in the lounge at Heathrow.
530,County-Hunter,4,"I guess I wasn't expecting much because I had never even heard of Vietnam Airlines, but on a recent short hop, they distinguished themselves on their level of service.  Even though the flight was only a little more than an hour, we still got served a full meal including coffee and/or tea.  And the food was pretty good.  We arrived on time and had no issues with check in or baggage pick up.  I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again."
531,Mel S,4,My wife and I flew direct from Heathrow to  Hanoi direct. Vietnam Airlines is the only one the flies direct. We paid £150 more for premium seats and I am so glad we did! Far more room and comfort. The service was excellent and we both commented on how rested we felt after an 11 hour flight.<br>Highly recommended.
531,Valenciavancouver,5,Flew from Hanoi to Paris with Vietnam Airlines and I would definitely fly with them again. The flight was smooth and on time. The plane was new and clean with a good selection of films and courteous service. They are affiliated with Air France/KLM so I regard them in much the same way. A positive experience.
531,oziken,5,"Flew Premium Economy Sydney/Ho Chi Minh City/Sydney. Seats are the way Business Class use to be - wide and tons of space in front. Greeted with choice of cold welcome drink. Meals same as Economy, but served first. Very smooth flight on the new Boeing Dreamliner - research this aircraft and you will see how advanced it is from a technical and passenger comfort point of view - absolutely amazing. Food was excellent or forward journey and just ok on the return - quality all ok but just not to my taste. Baggage allowance was 40kg plus 2 x 7kg for carry on. Pleasant cabin attendants that always had a smile. Looking forward to future Premium Economy flights with VN."
531,Eduardo R,4,"Good plane, on time and efficient service but basic...The food was OK...Breakfast very poor...Good entertainment...<br>On my way back we had people seating alone between 3 seats and others squeezed on 3 seats...Could not understand why during the check in  they airline did not spread us between the empty seats as a soon take off the ones with 2 empty seats next to them put their legs up and no one could seat there!"
531,moki786,4,The flight was comfortable although a little cramped as far as legroom is concerned. It wasn't too bad being a short flight.
532,Columbus118,1,"Disappointed in Vietnam airlines I’m 5’8 and The leg room killed me. Also the planes are so small you knock people As you walk down the aisle. The air hostesses Go by so<br>Quickly you can barely stop them for a drink, also the drinks are tiny you need about 3 to make a normal sized drink. Would not recommend at all."
532,Barramundi2000,2,"Poor communication, or lack of, on arrival at HCMC, I was merely ushered into the terminal  assuming all passengers were destined for HCMC or were experienced travelers at the airport and knew where they needed to go. I was not neither, not having flown overseas for a long time, and was travelling onto Cambodia being my destination and where I would collect my bags. I followed the directions of ground staff without any reason to question, but later realised that the document checks or whatever I passed through had lead me to be in the part of the airport where I was free to leave and roam Vietnam. Later I realised I must have passed through immigration - but how could this be when my single entry visa did not come into affect till 5 days later, and intended for when entering Vietnam from Cambodia by road. <br><br>I thought that it was a strange way of doing things but did not realise the consequences of  this lack of adequate instruction by Vietmam Airlines staff, or terminal staff for those travelling on to another country, or the bungle by Immigration staff when I arrived, and then again when leaving for Cambodia for not realising my visa was not valid at that time. A double stuff up!<br><br>It was only when on the bus from Cambodia to Vietnam that I was told my visa was no longer valid as it had been stamped ""used"", with a date prior to its validity!!!! Vietnamese military at border control would not be interested in explanations, even though it was obviously a mistake and I had all the documents to prove it. To avoid having to reschedule part or all of my holiday and all the cost and hassles associated with this I reluctantly accepted the only other option available to me to have a new visa arranged for me for when I arrived at the border in 2 hours. This cost me US$250 (AUD$325), almost half the cost of my entire international return flight. An expensive decision to fly Vietnam Airlines. <br><br>I have never had any problems with connecting to other flights in the past when travelling with other airlines.<br><br>Needless to say, and typical of assistance (or lack of in Vietnam and Cambodia) Vietnam Airlines refused to compensate me when I contacted the Sydney office, although agreeing instructions on the plane and at the terminal on connecting to other flights, and immigration control could be improved.<br><br>My flights were otherwise ok, service ok (not quite up to Qantas levels or awareness of hygiene) that I experienced in a short flight from Sydney to Brisbane at Christmas - where they actually gave instructions on those connecting with other flights, both on the plane and within the terminal.<br><br>The long haul planes were ok, newish 787s, however having a window seat was pointless as most of the time the crew had overridden the adjustable tinted windows (new??) so that passengers could not see out. I can only assume this was to keep the light out so that the cabin lights could be dimmed to reduce the need for service.<br><br>Would I risk the lack of information or assistance if I traveled with them again, where something worse could happen. No. This overrides everything else."
532,samathaduck,5,"Plane was clean, friendly and professional service. I think they are the best airlines in Vietnam, although there are 3 local airlines only in this country."
532,Tony C,5,"Courteous, friendly and knowledgeable staff.<br><br>Comfortable trip.   Requested to transfer to a different seat as my 'neighbor' passenger was moving in and out from the middle seat too frequently."
532,835buddy,5,"Air line was good need to have more leg room, and more 2 seaters. climbing over people all night to get up is not pleasant..If you ate plain food, well the menu on offer would not suit. Staff were friendly, and the shading out the view from the windows I thought it was dark, that is why you have a window seat to be able to relax and look out the window at the beautiful clouds,day or night.all in all i'm happy to be flying anywhere..had a few in'flights as well, they were fine, only short ones.love travelling."
533,Alwaysafan123,5,Service at counter excellent for a busy airport. Plane was very clean and staff very friendly and professional. Seats were bigger than most so no problem for husband who is tall. The cleanest airline i have ever been on plane was spotless withna beautiful blue upholstery very relaxing. Baggage was waiting for us on the carousel ...
533,cabbage08,5,We actually chose to fly premium economy this time and were very glad we did. The seating is two four two so we like to sit in the two seats by the window. The room we had was amazing with the person by the window able to get out without disturbing the other traveller. Being near the front of the plane has advantages as does the ability to board via Sky Proiroty. The cost difference was not all that much and the benifits well worth the extra money. Good food nice plane and friendly service. What more could you ask for?
533,Mike Hutt,2,Service was average at best. The staff were not really interested and the food was distinctly average.<br>Better to choose another airline of possible
533,lizspruce2018,4,"Was pleasantly surprised as some of the reviews were quite damming found the seats comfortable, the staff pleasant food okay, choice of entertainment okay not brilliant ,flights all left on time all in all for economy fine"
533,John P,4,"We travelled with Vietnam Airlines for our tour of Vietnam, our flight was delayed at Heathrow for about 45mins but we made up the time, the Dreamliner was very clean and the service and food was okay, the films were in English but had Vietnamese sub titles.<br>We had 3 internal flights and they were very good, all the airports were very clean and modern inc free WiFi in all airports.<br>Our return flight to the U/K was poor, the plane was dirty and the food was cold and not worth eating."
534,mummykitty,3,"I went to Ho Chinh Min by Vietnam Air with reasonable price due to inclusive of meal n 30kg baggage. I can say that overall it was a good flight only. My feedback firstly no entertainment, secondly the taking off n landing time seriously was not smoothly as one of the kid was vomitting inside the plane and thirdly the plane needs to refurbish. My compliment firstly the food was good, secondly the service staff was good n thirdly the plane was clean."
534,Ernjack1972,4,"We flew three short internal flights within Vietnam and all went well. Nice, modern A321 planes, on time with overall good service. Certainly better than the alternatives like Vietjet. Flying is really the best alternative in Vietnam because of the train system being so slow and the road system being so congested. I look forward to the day when land travel becomes more efficient."
534,Thewearyone,4,"Have been using Vietnam Airlines for a number of years as a value alternative to the more expensive airlines to get to Europe from Melbourne. Price is at least $3000 less than Emirates, but there is a long layover in Ho Chi Minh City. The airline provides a transit tour and hotel, which is convenient but could be improved greatly. Food, wine and comfort on the plane is very good and service is generally friendly and professional. Frequent flyer program isn't great, too many points required for redemption and no ""high street"" option like other airlines. Fares seem to be rising and soon the value won't be there."
534,MadamJosephine,4,"This was our first time flying with Vietnam Airlines. We flew a new Dreamliner plane, so in economy it was a 3-4-3 seat plan. We were in the middle section which was fine. The flight left on time, service was OK, food was edible and there were no issues. Leg room was good, there was lots of good movies to view and toilets were plentiful and clean.  We were unable to checked in / get seat allocation on line, so we were unable to avoid the long queue to check our bags. There was a lot of Vietnamese customers checking-in boxes as well as suitcases, which exacerbated the check-in time. Would fly with them again, but it would be handy for them to allow on-line seat allocation in Australia.We flew with them on internal flights in Vietnam and on-line seat allocation was available with a special quick lane to check in the bags."
534,ksanchez1,4,"Good, short flight.  Lounge is nice and service is good.  Vip bus for business class.  The attendent moved me to a better seat without me asking."
535,julia l,4,We flew to and from Vietnam with Vietnam Airlines.  All of our flights were on time including internal flights. The seat widths and leg room was good. Food was very good too. I would definitely use them again.
535,Danny O,3,"We checked in quickly and went through security. Expecting our flight to depart on time. I checked the departure board and it said our flight was departing 90 minutes after the original departure time. There was no assistance in Da Nang airport which is annoying. The flight was indeed 90 minutes late. <br>We eventually boarded and the business class is excellent, the chairs were comfortable and lots of leg room. We were given a small sandwich platter and drinks.<br>We booked business class through option town."
535,Danny O,4,"Flight was comfortable, on time and boarding was quick. Much larger leg room than most western airlines."
535,Marigrace L,5,We left the hotel very early to catch the flight which was at 6:50 am. The plane was very clean . I don’t remember the type of jet we were on but it looked like any other modern aircraft with first class seating coach and economy classes. I was in seat 36c. Because it was so early a lot of people took advantage of the chance to sleep. We were served <br>A beverage and a breakfast of a pastry wrap.Not sweet more nutritious.The flight was short and smooth.Tan Sun Nhut airport arrival was good . We collected our luggage fairly quickly and waited for the arrival of our guide This airline’s staff seemed very I was asking for <br>Professional and efficient and it excellent service. All safety directions were given in both English and I assume Vietnamese.It was a good flight .Also I would like to note <br>Since In don’t travel much I think it was very comfortable they made it easy.I also would like to say I asked for an aisle seat and I got one which I did not expect. There also seemed to be more leg room and the seat itself was more comfortable. The stewardesses had there native dresses and were attentive .There were no inflight entertainment because of the short flight.
535,jjw1969,4,"Reasonably priced flight, on time departure and arrival. Straightforward check-in and boarding. Friendly and competent crew. Decent leg space, though I was assigned an emergency exit row seat :-)<br>Good lounge if you have acces, but a bit noisy. Happily take this flight again."
536,easy1153,4,"My wife and I have just returned from 2 weeks in Vietnam.<br><br>We flew 2 international and 3 domestics legs with Vietnam Airlines. On previous trips to SE Asia we have always flown Singapore Airlines.<br><br>We chose VA this time as the schedule was more suitable along with the price comparison.<br><br>Very happy with our choice. All flights were, more or less, on time. The one significantly late flight Syd-SGN arrived only marginally late and didn't effect our connection.<br><br>3 of the flights were in near new 787 Dreamliners that were very comfortable with, in my opinion, excellent legroom for Economy.<br><br>We food the service and meals on board the longer flights above normal standard and very tasty.<br><br>Check in in all cases was quick, easy and efficient. There was little interaction with the crew but they were all friendly and quick to react to requests.<br><br>3 of the flights required a bus trip from the plane to/from the terminal. Not a problem, quickly and efficiently done.<br><br>Highly recommend if travelling to Vietnam and will use VA again with no hesitation"
536,williamanthonyj,4,"Always reliable and a good standard of cabin Service, on time with a friendly efficient service with good quality food and drink"
536,fjp4941,4,Nice new Dreamliner aircraft. The seat configuration is a bit different but overall still very comfortable. The service was a little bit slow but still very nice air stewards.
536,Paul L,5,"My wife, daughter and I flew Vietnam Airlines 4 times, within Vietnam ,and once from Thailand to Vietnam . My expectations were low ,but I was pleasantly surprised by the great level of service, no delays and no charge for check in luggage.<br>After speaking to travellers that flew other airlines that were really cheap, I was expecting to somehow pay for luggage, but never did. Our flights were very reasonable and probably cost less taking into consideration the baggage fees.<br>A tip to pass on, book your flights on the airlines' dedicated website.<br>Paul - Vancouver , Canada"
536,EM-Han,4,"The easiest flight from the West coast to Vietnam is via Taipei on Vietnam Airline or Taipei-based China Airlines...either of these airlines is very good, and often the flights are consolidated, the first leg on China Arilingthe second on Vietnam...China Eastern and China Southern are based in Mainland China and far less customer service oriented than these two."
537,Carolyn G,4,"The flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh was great the service and the food amazing, our internal flights were also fantastic our flight home was a slightly smaller aircraft and the food was average but the inclusions for economy is exceptional we will definitely be flying with them again"
537,makalu8000,4,"This is a great flight. Air craft has surprisingly good legroom. We actually landed 20 minutes early, which is amazing!<br><br>Food on board was terrible. Only negative, bit it is a short flight so it does not matter.<br><br>We have flown Vietnam Airlines around south-east Asia and have had no issues."
537,Law1974,5,Had a short hop between the two cities. Nice crew and helpful gate people. Good flight with no problems. Have newer planes. Felt very safe. We will be using them more on this trip.
537,LittleJourney,5,"Very pleasant flight, plenty of legroom. Staff very friendly &amp; helpful. Food - usual airline standard. Gave out bottles of water after food was served which was great. Flight left on time &amp; arrived on time. They definitely have improved their standards &amp; service since I first flew with them 18 months ago. Bit slow awarding points to frequent flyers, always have to follow up."
537,journey960,2,On my flight there were 12 toddlers in the aircraft.<br>It is very common Vietnamese to travel as families and while is strong culturally it lacks when it comes to on air attention.<br>Cabin pressure tornments small kids consequently they can all cry endlessly due to pain in their ears.<br>Many carriers take thoughtful measurements with soft toys entertainment gummies juice or eater even small kids packs.<br>Many young pareactnts do not know the remedy for those ocassions and hydration swallowing refocus attention and distraction from reality can help.<br>I would love to see even more interaction of crew in those cases..some carriers even assign certain sections of the aircraft where kids can interact and reshift attention.<br>We have seen breakthroughs on this carriers.<br>Lets shift attention to families.
538,Sandra P,5,"Upgraded and were extremely happy with the service, gave us priority  boarding and luggage collection, which was great. More leg room and bigger seats.  Well worth the extra cost. Friendly staff, the food, well it's  airline food, what more can you say."
538,a60,4,We booked business class so we could have 30kg each. The business class lounge was very comfortable with lots of seating/lounging areas and the food was lovely and varied. On board couldn't fault the service we were given. Unfortunately the flight was delayed 2 hours.<br><br>The lounge at Danang only has limited food available however it is comfortable waiting for your flight. Unfortunately this flight was also delayed by 1 hr. Service on board was excellent. <br><br>I went for a walk through the terminal at Danang and you could imagine my surprise when I saw the 2 pilots of our plane look out at the tarmac and see their plane wasn't there!
538,DianeAoki,5,"When you have no complaints, that is a good review. It wasn’t the cheapest available but just a few dollars more than the so-called budget airlines. So many flights and service excellent."
538,2232KenJi,4,This is a short flight. I selected Vietnam Airlines because their schedule had convenient timings. They have a good record of service.
538,engotwo,5,"The trip was wonderful, on time, no issues with luggage even if it was over a few pounds, new airplanes, Excellent Services and the airplane was not too full.  Very Cordial Crew."
539,Marvin W,5,"My go to airline for domestic travel in VN, far superior to all of the budget airlines.  Coach and business class are comfortable, and the service is wonderful in both."
539,KM-Cooperstown,5,"Wonderful airline - took it throughout our tour of Vietnam over two weeks.  Excellent service, modern equipment, good in-flight amenities.  Much prefer it to any of the US domestic airlines."
539,Barry C,1,"Vietnam Airlines can not fill their flights so they use other carriers but because this is done at the last minute the other carrier does not have the space for all the extra passengers so those that do not have connecting flights will be put off first to the next available which can be the next day to bad if you are connecting with a ship,  tour or what ever. Appersultly no consideration even if you have booked months before."
539,flat43,4,Efficient and friendly checkin at CXR airport (new one being built looks impressive)... bus to the aircraft on standoff and comfortable seats on board....no service on this short sector however the crew offered free water...smooth landing and what more can you hope for.
539,sylwah,5,"Excellent service, both on board and at the airport.  My husband had his swollen foot bandaged.  They immediately called for a wheelchair and amended our seats so that he had a blocked seat next to him for his foot.  The flight was only a short one, each way, but the cabin crew were attentive, helpful and simply delightful.  No food on this short flight service so I cannot comment on this."
540,Truc T,1,"A family of 4 including 2 parents and 2 little kids, they allocated 1 parent at one end of the plane and the other with the two kids! In the middle of the fly the kids need help and it was extremely hard for the dad to move over to help as the plane is full"
540,suksimpli,3,"Air crew helpful and business liked, without smiles. The rice noodles was very salty and a bit over heated, looked like iron wire!"
540,Kaz,5,"I have flown twice to Ho Chi Minh City on Vietnam Airlines.  I could not fault them.  Both times both ways they left on time, food wasn't too bad and enough of it, and service was pretty good.  The only thing I think needs improving is the movie selection."
540,Tom K,5,"Flying on Vietnam Airlines on one in-country flight, and again, from Hanoi to Taipei, I really appreciated how they got people situated and got in the air. No frills and efficient. The attendants were professional and cordial, but they had a skill of getting everybody seated and we were off. I noticed that difference. The plane was old and regular crowded economy section, but both flights were super efficient."
540,rhbayles,4,Excellent - flatbeds very comfortable and staff regularly checking all okay and handing out drinks/bottles of water.  Easy to operate TV/film/music selections.
541,Bill H,3,"Unfortunately it was raining in Hue for our departure. A plane load of passengers were herded in to a shuttle bus to take us to the plane. Then we had to dodge to rain again running to the stairs up to the plane. There are no jetways at Hue. Crew were just there doing their job, No charm. No smiles."
541,lachkeira,4,"We found Vietnam Airlines to be very efficient, punctual and hospitable. We also flew domestic with them within Vietnam 3 times, and whilst one flight was about 20 minutes late, we arrived 15 minutes before the scheduled time I had.<br>The seats in economy were a little tight with 3 plus sized guys, which domestically wasn't a problem, but wasn't so good for the international travel, but they were standard compared to other airlines.<br>My one gripe was that the entertainment is not available for about 30 minutes after take off, then headphones are collected and entertainment switched off about 30 minutes before landing, so you lose at least an hour of watching something. Don't understand why this is, other airlines allow full access from the moment you board to the time you leave. If I'd had my own headphones I could have got another 20 minutes in maybe!<br>We were fortunate enough to be upgraded on a domestic flight, so whilst only short, it was lovely and we didn't realise until we got on the plane, so it was a nice surprise. No idea why we got it, but we were more than happy with it, would have been fantastic on the international leg, but you take what you can get.<br>All in all, pleasant staff, good service, reliable and punctual."
541,Bluebirdzz,3,"We arrived at the airport in good time and stood in line to check in. When we approached the check in desk the lady at the desk was extremely abrupt and pointed at my suitcase that I'd put on the conveyor, it took several attempts to interpret her gesticulations but eventually turned the suitcase around so the handle was facing her to put the label through.<br>I was travelling with a friend and we asked if there was a possibility of having seats with more leg room - we had asked this when flying out of Heathrow and the check-in person there was more than helpful and telephoned through to ask them to open the emergency seating - however, this check-in person just said the seats were automatically allocated and if we wanted anything different we would have to ask in Ho-Chi Minh. <br>When we got to Ho-Chi Minh there was no opportunity to change seats as we were in departures and all seats had been allocated for a full flight. We ended up in the middle aisle with very little space on a 13 hour flight."
541,Bluebirdzz,4,Everything went on time. It was a busy flight but we were all given wet wipes to freshen up and a bottle of water. Smooth &amp; easy
541,28Lynn10,5,"Easy check in<br>No issues with luggage<br>2hr flight that had lunch served<br>plenty of room<br>Only downside is the bus to and from the terminals, packed onto 2 buses."
542,Lois W,4,"The flight with Vietnam Air was very good with a duration of 1 hour 10 minutes.  Very smooth take off and landing and uneventful flight in the air.  Service with a smile although, due to the short trip, refreshment was limited to bottled water or Coca Cola."
542,Cristie M,4,Good flight.  The food was good.  The seats were a little torn and out dated but it was good.  For a short flight to Vietnam it was good.  The flight took off on time and arrived on time and the staff were helpful and attentive.
542,sanjoy m,3,"Flight was rescheduled twice and delayed, gated was changed at the last minute, no food, no entertainment on board, but its a short flight."
542,Tazbot,4,"Service was good, staff were very attentive, especially towards passengers with isues We were comfortable as is possible in economy.  The food was yummy and fresh and the toilets were clean."
542,CaPalm,4,Better than expected. While not a long flight they even managed to get a snack (edible---not great) out to a full flight. Friendly. On time. Clean. New equipment for the most part.
543,IvanaK935,5,"Such a great experience to fly with Vietnamese Airlines. A great airplane, superb staff and they even offer food on a domestic flight. Super fact check in and boarding process. Highly recommended!"
543,Suzie F,4,"For a short flight, service was fantastic, the plane was new and comfortable. Will use and recommend again."
543,Robert B,4,Have flown on this airline several times before. On each occasion the service both before and during the flight has been very good. The business lounge at Ho Chi Minh airport is perhaps not as luxurious as others but is very comfortable with a good range of food and drinks. The cost of business class travel is reasonable. Business class seating internally is comfortable and the service is good. The one negative is that often flights are changed or delayed though the delays are generally not lengthy. Overall the airline is a good choice.
543,nsweeney2017,4,"Flying from London Heathrow to Ho chi minh city. Excellent 12 hour flight on the Dreamliner feeling fresh and in good condition. food was good although not quite enough. asked for a snack and was given a couple of small sandwiches, enough to keep me going. good in flight entertainment. would definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again and would definitely fly Dreamliner again."
543,MikkelTorsting,4,Service was good and stadig was Nice. Flight on time. Only negative was that you Do not board at gate. Need bus to the plane
544,Sergey P,4,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines to Phu Quoc with a stop over in Ha Noi. Service on board was very good, staff was very attentive and always near, connection in Ha Noi was so quick that it took us only 50 minutes from landind at the international airport to being inside the domestic terminal waiting for the flight to Phu Quoc. That was probably the quickest transfer we have ever experienced. Staff was everywhere in the airport looking after our every step and guiding, well done! The only thing we didn't like the plane was rather shabby and the entertainment system was not working - not that nice for a 9 hour flight. I talked to the cabin crew and they said that was the last flight of the aircraft and they would phase it out. Our flight home is arranged with new boeing 787. Will see. And last but not least, flying with Vietnam airlines was significantly cheaper than with Airflot, and the service was better in my opinion. So, well done Vietnam Airlines, and think about it Aeroflot."
544,botmi,3,"We flew from Singapore to Phu Quoc via Ho Chi Minh and then back same way. Although the planes are spacious and the service is solid, there are plenty of areas when I feel that things can be improved:<br>- boarding: the priority passengers started boarding after the economy passengers... really<br>- Plenty of delays and excuses... The incoming flight was delayed, which is not our fault. Who's fault is it because the incoming plane is still Vietnam Airlines :) As we approached Ho Chi Minh, we were told the airport is closed due to a VIP in the area... wow... and the worst one, one our way back, I booked a flight to Ho Chi Minh that was departing at 11am, but they cancelled that flight and moved me onto a 8:50am flight. Thank you for making a 2h stopover in Ho Chi Minh into a 4h one. Nicely done!<br>- The Ho Chi MInh airport itself is very chaotic, but I assume that it is a different company than the Airline so I would only say, be prepare to walk your own luggage from one terminal to the next, that is no bus.shuttle/train, etc... walk. <br>- food on the plane was excellent  <br>- no individual screens, so very archaic on that front<br>- excellent seats and pitch"
544,Mickael M,5,"This is a very short flight but the cabin crew were very attentive and provided pre-flight drink (fruit juice), cold towel and a snack / drinks (no wine but beer, soft drinks and coffee) during the flight. They even offered a blanket. The seat on this A321 are a bit old but still very comfortable - not 3 economy seats with the middle seat empty but a real business class seat with recline. The lounge in the domestic terminal is also well stocked with food and drinks, including alcohol."
544,LCGOOD,4,"We were pleasantly surprised by the Airline, quite new 787 DreamLiner, clean and mostly on time. A little difficult to understand the announcements at times but the food and service was very good. We flew several times also internally and again very good all round."
544,127Fred,4,"The airline was create in 1993. We understand that 2015 saw the top management discovering the art of service, and decided that communist-style service was no longer the best choice (if it ever were).<br><br>The perceived result, based upon a return long-haul flight, is quite encouraging.<br><br>A few false notes, of various natures, remain:<br>- the website is heavy, with a lot of things being loaded, and did not always work for check-in<br>- the airport boarding process, both times, was quite a shambles: not enough staff, several staff members standing around and providing no participation in the process; needless to say, machine-based check-in was not an option, and queues were endless<br>- on-board entertainment included a catalogue of films with subtitles wrongly indicated, international blockbusters, and a few excellent Vietnamese films; the mislabelling was not necessary<br>- a dish tasting just acceptable, looking like turkey and labelled as turkey was offered as 'chicken', leaving at least a passenger worrying if being taken for a fool<br><br>On a more substantial nature, the planes were quite modern and new, the staff attitude was quite professional, and the flights were on time. Based upon the reviews, we suspect that the upgrade of image and service level has been concentrated on international flights. We noticed a very modest type of communication, with little flashy advertising, modest uniforms (bland colours, simple cut, nothing fancy), and little or no show-off."
545,Leanne Culina-Penza,5,"We were very pleasantly surprised with our first time travelling with Vietnam Airlines. The planes were spacious, even in economy, the food was as we have found with most airlines. We found the staff friendly and attentive. Finally the entertainment system had a very decent selection of movies, which always helps to make the flight go quicker."
545,phelix2015,5,"This was a pleasant surprise.  The flight, staff and service were excellent.  Nothing was  a problem.  I would most definitely recommend this airline."
545,Gillian C,4,We flew on the Dreamliner 787 which is a comfortable plane bit it was let down with the standard of food and the sound equipment. You had the choice of Asian or western  food but the food was mostly in edible.  This did not improve for our return flight home in fact I think it was worse .   The video system volume was very poor and with only Vietnamese subtitles you struggled to enjoy the movie .   The flight attendants were friendly and all flights were on time but I'm not sure I would fly Vietnam airways again .
545,shazkershaw,4,The flight attendants were very good except that it was hard to get return service once they have served you the first drink ( soft drink or alcoholic).  The food was your typical airline food but it was okay and welcome compared to other where you have to pay extra for this.<br>The seats were adequate for economy class and we had the exit door seats due to a medical condition I had.  the bad part was the we were unable to book these seats online check in so had to wait until we arrived at the airport to try and ge them but luckily we were able to.
545,aussiedave717,3,We flew Vietnam Airlines Sydney - Siem Reap - Siagon - Danang - Hanoi - Siagon - Sydney.<br>The seats were confined.<br>The food was not really suitable for Australia tastes.<br>The entertainment system was not reliable and the selections limited and old.<br>Service was poor.
546,ke0ghp,4,"It was great value, modern fleet , felt very safe , plane was clean, attentive but not over the top service. <br><br>Domestic service was just as good with a modern clean plane."
546,Cristina L,5,"After reading some mixed reviews online, I was a bit skeptical about flying with Vietnam Airlines. However, flying with them was great and actually much better than some of the European airlines I flew with. The cabin was nice and clean, the seats seemed a big wider than usual and they were comfortable for a short haul flight. The staff was polite. The food they served was really good by airline standards. Everything else went really well, I had 4 flights in all with Vietnam Airlines and none of them were delayed. Nothing to complain about, it was actually a really enjoyable experience to fly with Vietnam Airlines."
546,Michael M,3,"We have not had very good experiences with this particular airline and will never use them again. A total of five flights (two international, one domestic), with a delay of more than an hour on two of the flights. You need to allow extra time if you intend to connect to another flight as the average two hours is not long enough. On the leg from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh, we sat on the tarmac on a bus for over 40 minutes. No explanation from any staff. One lady started to suffer a panic attack but we could not even get the attention of any staff on the ground. Staff are not particularly friendly and the food is pretty average, even for airline food."
546,Kuv_lun,5,"There's lots of cheap companies in Vietnam and Asia but quite often I notice that the flights of Vietmam airlines have almost the same price or even lower and also have some advanages as higher service, lower possibilities of delay, baggage etc."
546,Michele C,5,As I had an issue with my booking I found the staff at Luang Prabang very helpful in getting me a seat on the plane. The flight departed 30 mins early &amp; was a shorter flight by 10 mins so I was able to check into my hotel in Hanoi earlier than expected.<br>Many thanks.
547,jajajajam_b,4,"Great value for your money - cheap fares, friendly and happy-looking flight crew, smooth plane ride. Even the in-flight meal wasn't bad."
547,Suzanne E,3,"Flew to Vietnam and did all our internal flights with Vietnam airlines. Long haul from London was ok but below average food and beverage selection and availability. Service was good from staff. Internal flights ok water offered, staff friendly."
547,Alan B,5,Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and comfort provided. Good leg room combined with comfortable seats and the cabin crew are excellent. Food amongst the best I have had.
547,Alfred L,4,"Good Service, normal space seats.  Frankly, the space of seats is not so comfort but just normal.  The plane is small. The service is nice but not wow ~~  However, the price is attractive."
547,JBH32,4,"Flew premium economy on an overnight flight in a Dreamliner.  Comfortable seats, good food with a reasonable choice."
548,Helen ET,4,"We have flown on 6 Vietnam Airlines flights in the last month, hopping around Vietnam and Cambodia as well as the flights to and from Oz. Even though not one of these flights left on time (similar to Virgin in my experience), I could not fault the service, meals, and cleanliness on these flights."
548,Vince Huynh,4,"Good legroom on economic seat, the food tasty, air hostess serve with happy genuine smile. I would say their meal quite light and that's why they always server sandwich or instant noodles midnight during the fly. Good selection of in light entertainment and with their new plane, the seats more comfy and better air pressure inside cabin. There is paid wifi service on board and I find it helpful during long flight (Vietnam and Thai airways do have Wifi on their planes, but not the Malaysia airline)<br>Long queues at SGN airport to check in but staff at airport was helpful and good to see they have ""nothing to declare"" gate to speed up the arrival exit. <br>Overall I would happy to flight direct VN - London again with Vietnam airline. Although their price starting to get more expensive now compared to Thai and Fillipine national airlines."
548,blitzboy,3,"We have just flown from London to Hanoi in Premium Economy. We had a dedicated check in which went smoothly and boarding was very straight forward. We were on the New Dreamliner Plane which was extremely comfortable. There are 35 seats in the PE cabin in a 2 3 2 layout. The seats had a good recline so plenty of room to stretch out. We enjoyed the two meals we had on the flight. Lunch consisted of a Smoked Salmon and potato salad starter followed by Szechuan style chicken with Steamed rice. Both delicious . For puds we had fresh fruit and cheese and biscuits. There are also a good selection of drinks. For breakfast we enjoyed Poached egg with Hollandaise sauce, grilled bacon and hash brown potato. Again followed by fresh fruit. The one downside to the flight was the half hearted attitude of the cabin crew. But overall an OKAY experience."
548,Brian L,4,When I arrived at the domestic terminal of Ton San Nhat International Airport at 5.30am for my Vietnam Airlines 6.50am flight to Da Lat I was not expecting to find several hundred other passengers all queueing up to get through the security check for departures and was quite stocked at the though of how long this was going to take. The vast number of people in the queue at other airports had previously provoked concern as to whether I would actually make it through with enough time to board the flight<br><br>Well I needn't have worried as the airport staff had set up the queueing area (not recognizably at first) into 2 parallel flowing lines so the flow of passengers was constant and we got through the process quite comfortably. For passengers arriving with serious time pressure there was an additional fast track that could be used as well.<br><br>Congratulations to Vietnam Airlines for simply solving this potentially aggravating issue for travelers
548,Primestop,5,"The cabins in Economy are much the same as any other Economy cabin on a long-haul flight, but the crew were friendly, the food was edible, the entertainment was extensive and the ground experience was timely and efficient.  I'd welcome another flight with Vietnam Airlines."
549,Ann M,4,"We used Vietnam Airlines twice during or trip in Vietnam 1st Hanoi- Da Nang 2nd Hue- HCMC, both flights were delayed, which did effect our plans at our destinations. The flights themselves were good and the plane was clean,  nice staff, the uniforms are lovely."
549,frog2016,5,"We had two internal flights on Vietnam Airlines. Easy check in. Clean aircraft, polite, attentive cabin staff and on time. Free water and soft drinks. Captain seeing passengers off flight. Faultless."
549,samtansh,3,"1. the VN airline counter is very few, always very long queue waiting and always waiting. at least 40 min waiting for check-in every time. vietnam airline is one of the worst airlines.<br>2. silver skyteam membership is not useful for quick check in. same waiting. <br>3. the SGN customs need to waiting for 40 min to get through too, because always so many people there.<br>4. the airbus A350 is ok, but 3-3-3 layout is not as good as A333 at all."
549,tonybh321,5,Very good attentive staff. Planes on time (flew 5 times in 2 weeks with this airline). Excellent food and wine on the long haul flights. Great films to watch. Quick turnarounds with internal flights.
549,Anders P,3,"Travelled SGN-HUI 31/3-2018 on A321. They had announced me earlier about ½ hour preponed schedule which forced me to change my flight to the next day. After some mistakes on their side I got the flight I wanted free of extra charges, but had to stay-over a night in Saigon. Check-in took some time due to queue but the security at Domestic took 30 Minutes to pass. Flight full, on time. I brought instant coffee bags and they served me hot coffee – otherwise catering is limited to Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and still water. Bus-gating is very annoying, they pack their gate-transfer buses like sardine cans, so there is no space even if standing. In HUI its even more radicolous as the airport is always idle but you are not allowed to walk the 2-300 meter from the airplane to the Terminal despite there is no other security issues. You have again to endure this tedious, lengthy, humiliating sardine packing just to create local employment. To pack the bus with 70 people takes 15 Minutes, to unpack it takes 5 Minutes, The drive itself takes 1 Minute. No April fools"
550,RieList,4,It was ok. The flight was only 40 min delayed. <br>Water was provieded during the flight.<br>The information during ho chi Minh was poor.
550,Kevin M,5,I have flown with this airlines on numerous occasions and every time they are excellent<br>The planes are immaculate  the service is impeccable <br>I would highly recommend  this airlines to anyone <br>Keep up the good work<br>You can fly anywhere in the country for 50 dollars US  and even get a hot meal and bar service
550,Jdt1989,2,"Worst flight and service, unable to sit together and no vegetarian meal even though pre booked before and no other options hardly ate on journey, staff very unhelpful and non existent at times you had to go and find them if you needed anything, have flown with many airlines and this has to be one of the worst."
550,Ali C,2,"On a 3 week trip around Vietnam , we had 4 of our internal flights booked with Vietnam airways and every single one was changed by them at a late stage - one was even totally cancelled forcing us to have to fly to HCM to pick up a flight to where we needed to be. <br>Last minute changes almost cost us massive disruption to our flight back to uk.<br>Flights were comfortable and they made efforts to keep us informed but the stress it caused was horrible."
550,Helen R,3,"Good size screens, nice food (though our choice had run out by the time we ordered on the outward flight - do order more Vietnamese food Vietnam airlines. as the return flight is around midnight, we thought we would eat in the lounge (Lotus). Big mistake, poor selection or poor food.  I had a query about carry on luggage before leaving and rang the London office - very unusually for a vietnamese lady - very sharp and shouty (but maybe she just got  out of bed on the wrong side).<br>We had pronlems with the English language website when we were trying to print off tickets in Vietnam - after ages of trying the hotel did it on the vietnamese site - apparently freezing of the english site a common problem,"
551,Wendy G,4,"This was our second flight with Vietnam Airlines as we had previously flown from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang with them. We did not book seats but were very happy that we were given seats in an exit row with the extra legroom gratefully excepted. It was not a long flight but we were happy with the price, seats, comfort , and cleanliness of the airplane."
551,John R,4,"No problems, good flight. There is no online check-in in Dalat. The airline wanted me to be at the airport 2 hoours before the flight, in Hanoi that was one hour for a domestic flight!  I got a limo from the hotel to the airport and was at the airport about 1 1/2 hoours before my flight. I could have arrived later, I think check-in closed aobout 40 minutes before the flight but it is a small airport. When flying domestic in Vietnam keep the luggage check that they give you when you check your bag handy, you will need it when yoou collect your bag from bagage claim at the other end."
551,Michael L,4,"Paying extra for business class for an internal flight was worth every cent. Priority security screening saved about a 30minute wait, into the lounge which was just average. Seat was an older type but quite spacious and comfortable. All in all a very good experience."
551,tidekazow,5,"Great service, comfortable lie flat beds. Good food with great choices, clean toilet.<br>Smoothest landing ever! We also flew with them fram Yangon to Hanoi and back to Paris, same good experience. Cheaper Business Class than other major airlines!"
551,haileythegolden,3,"We flew on a airbus, 3 seats per side of plane. It was a 90 minute flight and they served a nice lunch. Service was good. If this was a North American flight there is no meal. Good service. Got  to siem reap on time"
552,Tami M,3,"I had read in the forum (here) that the domestic flights in Vietnam were often late and that was true for us. I bought first class tickets since we had to take our bags and didn’t have status, which I recommend if you can. Our first flight was 2.5 hours late but we had lotus lounge access because we flew first class, which was really nice. We were loaded onto a bus to the plane only to be taken back to the airport again but we did eventually get there. The flight crew was nice and the flight itself was fine. On the way back we only had about a half hour delay. If you go into the experience knowing delays will be likely and you’re patient and nice to everyone, it’s really easier on everyone. : ) I would not recommend a tight connection or having your trip depend on an on time flight with any of these airlines."
552,JanC,5,"The title says it all - we were made to feel welcome at every stage of the trip.  Check in was straightforward, staff had good clear English, the boarding process was efficient and the flight was on time.  It was a short flight so there was no meal but we were given a bottle of mineral water.  Would recommend the airline and will fly with them again."
552,Moira M,5,This was the first time I have flown with Vietnam Airlines and I was pleasantly surprised at their modern fleet of Airbus A350s. The plane was clean and the in flight service and food was exceptionally good. The new international airport at Da Nang was due to open the following week which means it will be possible to fly direct avoiding a stop over in Ho Chi Minh. The flights were on time and luggage collection was quick. Internal flights within Vietnam are not cheap.
552,Pornchai R,5,"At first I was reluctant to book this airline. But to my surprise, almost everything was nice. Aircraft used was new. Foods were delicious. Entertainments offered could compete with top ranking airlines. Punctuality was near to perfection. The only weak point was the cabin crews seemed to be lack of experiences in providing up to standard services. They could speak very little English. I got very good airfares too. Really love flying with this airline."
552,martyn,4,Great direct service. From check in to arrival - all went well. The cost was very good compared to other airlines who have a stop.
553,Miranda N,3,"We travelled to Nha Trang and back with this airline, and though it was delayed it was a nice trip. It only lastet about an hour and they gave a small bottle of water. It was a nice and effective flight."
553,Avril60,3,"When we first booked the flight, we were supposed to have a transit time of 2hrs 55mins at HCMC (arrive 14:20 &amp; depart 17:15). This was fine as we need to actually clear immigration, collect our luggage &amp; make our way from the international terminal to the domestic terminal on foot (less than 10mins walk) at HCMC.<br>2 mths later, we received a flight change notification to tell us that our connecting flight was moved to 18:35 which meant a wait of 4hrs 15mins. This was again changed to 20:00, meaning a 5hr 40min wait. We couldn’t cancel &amp; change as booking then would mean a very expensive ticket as we were closer to flight date. The airports are small with very few seats in the non-controlled area. There’s really very few things you can do at the airport to kill time. Thank goodness there’s free wifi.<br>There was yet again a flight delay to Nha Tráng after we’ve checked in. And believe it or not, the flight delay was caused by the late arrival of the service crew. The Pilots arrived early but the service crew arrived at 20:00 (departure time) &amp; we saw them casually walking to the plane whilst we were at the waiting area. The captain confirmed this when he apologised for the delay quoting that it was due to late arrival of crew. He must be equally upset.<br>I must confess that this was the cheapest option for us to fly on a non-Budget airline to Nha Trang from Singapore, hence the average rating."
553,Lee-anne R,4,Service was friendly though basic in regards to drinks/food.......the flight is only 1 hour and water or soft drink or fruit juice was available following issue of water and refresher towel.   Ideally would have also liked a packet of nuts/fruit or similar especially seeing as flight was over lunch period. <br>Friends highly rated Vietnam air for international flight from Sydney to Hanoi
553,Amit M,4,Vietnam Airline-  Best in Class for Economy Passengers. very good leg space. On time departure and very good In flight Meals.
553,14punitk,4,A very cordial air services provided with a smiling faces. The check-in procedure was smooth with slight broken language. The aircraft was very neat &amp; clean. The cabin service was very prompt but the food is pure non-veg. The in-flight entertainment is slightly restricted because of language.
554,Oliver C,5,"As the title says - Vietnam Airlines is not a budget airline, but it’s still very reasonable. Despite that, the service was really nice on the plane, the chairs comfortable, reasonable leg room, entertainment services were great. All round good airline."
554,PhilthetravellerXI,4,"I recently flew Vietnam Airlines direct to Hanoi from Sydney. I remember many times going to Vietnam in previous years when one had to fly into Hanoi via Singapore or Bangkok which added to the time and cost of the trip, it is great now to have direct flights. The plane was a very new Boeing Dreamliner and fantastically comfortable and efficient - I flew Premium Economy and the seating was excellent with very good seats, spacious and roomy where you could stretch out your legs and remain very refreshed during the 9 hour flight. Their Premium Economy seating is much better than Qantas I must say. The cabin crew where efficient and friendly. Meal service was fair, if you like cheap flexible plastic utensils and basic but tasty fare. The washrooms were of good size but the cabin crew were a little tardy to maintain and replace used items like tissues. The windows  were very good with electronic shading where you can adjust the transmission and darken the cabin. The entertainment system worked well but had limited movies, in English, and most were old re-runs and second rate movies. Don’t get too excited about catching up with the latest. Most people in the Premium Economy cabin (seats 35 passengers) ended up reading or playing with their own iPads. The check-in and boarding in Sydney was a bit of a challenge being a full plane and passengers queuing in wrong queues - perhaps better signage or more on the ground staff would have been useful. Once aboard however it was a very comfortable and enjoyable trip and a good alternative to stopping over in another city. I’d certainly fly the new revamped Vietnam Airlines again - vastly different to decades ago with their old aircraft. The direct flight to and from Hanoi means you don’t have to go via Ho Chi Minh City and its busy airport, Hanoi’s new airport is so much easier and pleasant."
554,Roland G,4,"We travelled from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh and then from Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh City back to Melbourne.  They work to a schedule on board and love to play self advertisements at every opportunity :-) <br>The connecting flights were a challenge with little assistance available in working out how to move from one side of the Ho Chi Minh City airport to the other.<br>Be prepared to squash, face to face, on buses from the terminal, across the tarmac to the plane.  Overall the experience was great."
554,Christian C,5,"Boarding was easy and fast, the flight arrived on time and the on board service was great. A good varity of Beverages, exellent food and comfortable seats with space.<br>The Airplane was the new A350"
554,Jackson9305,5,"I want to express special thanks to the ground check-in attendant (name unfortuantely not noted) who noticed, upon our transfer from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City and on to Nha Trang, that we could get on the next immediate flight as opposed to having to wait about five hours for our scheduled one. She went to great efforts to check us in and even let us use her mobile phone to call our hotel in Nha Trang so that our pick-up service would know that we were arriving much earlier than expected. She even accompanied us to the security check and made sure we got to our flight on time.<br><br>We were impressed with Vietnam Airlines anyway, with the quality of food and the seats on all of its planes we flew."
555,sunnynorth2018,3,"This is the third time I flew with this airline within a month. The new airplanes are excellent and the old ones so so! The in flight personnel is always very courteous and helpful. On the negative side, the check in line ups are always long even for those who have already checked in on line."
555,georgiegirl,5,"Very impressed with this airline and chose it after reading reviews on the cheaper ones for 3 internal flights. Very good service from the check in procedure to the end of the flights. All flights on time, nice lunch on the longer 2 hr flight from Saigon to Hanoi was a nice surprise.  Air stewards were very efficient and friendly on the planes and also very helpful at check in. I love the guide at the front of the queue,keeping the lines flowing to check in counters which was great as I was cutting it a bit fine for the closing time at Saigon, this is a great part of the service. check in staff were friendly. love the wet towel! Just be prepared to squash, face to face,  on buses to get out to tarmac at Saigon but overall the experience was great."
555,Andrew M,5,"This Airline has purchased new planes and it makes all the difference. Lay flat beds along with good food and great staff make the long flight very enjoyable.<br><br>For just a little more than say Quantas Premium Economy and a lot less than Quantas Business you can fly in equal comfort and spend the change on upgrading hotels or extra spending money.<br><br>The added benefit is being able to have a stop-over in either Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi, we did both.<br><br>My new number one Australia - Europe airline. Massive thumbs up!"
555,blondros,5,"We actually flew more Vietnam airlines domestic and then from Hanoi back to Sydney and it all the flights were fantastic. Staff were very good, service was excellent, food was good. My husband thought the legroom was good as he is fairly tall and finds it cramped sometime but he didn't on these flights"
555,Widlydidly,2,"Heathrow to Hanoi, on time, nice Dreamliner, lots of legroom, crew OK, food poor, arrived on time<br>Hanoi to Danang, 3 hours delay, old plane combined 2 flights, no useful service<br>Danang to Hanoi, on time all goog<br>Hanoi to Heathrow, dreadful experience, very poor food, invisible crew, no information but did arrive on time"
556,MrandMrsRo,5,Short internal flight - quick to depart and to disembark and luggage off really quickly<br><br>Only water served on the flight
556,kent k,5,"This one hour flight was the first Air Vietnam flight I have ever booked.  It was on time, the service was excellent, and there was adequate leg room.  The rest rooms were spotless and the cost was very low..."
556,michael c,5,"Not too cramped, entertainment options good, flight attendants - excellent. And, food pretty good. Better on outward flight than return. Toilets clean."
556,Gingerfatlad,1,"I booked a multi-trip through Vietnam Airlines for a friends wedding. Flying from Heathrow to Hanoi, I was impressed. The food and level of service was good, the plane modern and reasonably priced. <br><br>The next day I flew from Hanoi to Dalat. I received an email that the flight would now leave half an hour earlier. Not ideal, but it was to much of a change. <br><br>After spending a few days in Dalat, I was due to leave at 1215 to fly to Da Nang (a 1 hour flight). I arrived a the Airport and the flight had been rescheduled to 2020!!! No emails received and unable to check in online so I didn’t know any better. After waiting an hour for a rep to appear, a after a long argument I managed to get them to pay for a taxi back to Dalat and back to the airport so I didn’t have to sit in the airport all day. <br><br>1830 I wait at the the hotel reception for the taxi back to the airport. I check my phone and they’ve pushed the flight back to 2250 now... a total of 11 hours late.<br><br>I emailed the airline stating how it ruined my day and plans in Da Nang. Their response; sorry, nothing we can do.<br><br>The airline seems nice enough, staff generally polite and efficient, but if you book internal flights, fully expect them to change the times the day before. The forums are full of people with the same issue. <br><br>Terrible service from what is meant to be a premium airline."
556,JamHam,3,"Like many other Asian airlines that are considered budget, you get a seat and a flight. No frills, no real service. It serves the purpose of getting you to your destination with little comfort."
557,millyh,5,"As we were travelling with our dog for the first time we were worried and concerned how she would cope .She is a very nervous dog and scared of her own shadow.<br>Vietnam Airlines staff where fantastic with her and made the process so easy .allowing us to spend as much time with her before the flight.Its twelve hours from London to Saigon But the flight was comfortable the service onboard along with the food was very good ,the drinks service was frequent and wine served with the meal.The staff are not overly friendly but this could be because of the language difference.Our overall journey was excellent and will definitely fly with them again ."
557,emma_Wisconsin,5,The staff were very friendly and efficient. The aircraft was clean and seats are comfortable. The inflight food was delicious. Will highly recommend. Can accumulate with Delta points.
557,GMS19,5,"Flew business one way, economy return. First time using this airline and would definitely book again. Business lounges in Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City lovely (try the salty lemonade - delicious in hot weather). Cabin staff smiling and attentive in both business and coach. Meals tasty. Hot meal service in coach from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore on 2 hour flight- did not expect that!"
557,Luz Nguyen,4,"Well, I usually take Vietnam Airlines for my trip and sometimes with Vietjet Air (they have many routes when compares them each other). Everything is average, you could not find excellent services there. It's fine for short trip as well."
557,BudgetTraveler010,3,Pleasantly surprised after traveling on the budget airlines.  The seats were wider and there was considerably more leg room.  The inflight service was very good and the flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The flight is only 1.5 hours.  We had a bit of turbulence midway.  The captain came on and explained what was happening.  Would recommend Vietnam Air if you need to be at your next destination on time as my experience on the other local airlines weren't as reliable.  Also more comfortable but you do pay for the difference.
558,Bellagio62,5,This was an overnight flight from HCMC to Tokyo. I elected for business class because I needed a good nights sleep. The cabin crew was friendly and left me alone during the flight which I appreciated due to wanting sleep. As soon as I woke they offered me a meal before landing and made sure I was taken care of. I don't know if it was my particular seat or the design but it would not go all the way flat. There were still a few more degrees to make it completely flat but it was not enough to even make it an issue. I'd be happy to fly this airline again.
558,Peter M,3,"what can I say ? my first time in biz class , as you all know that is all good and well after 30 trips in cattle class, Vietnam air is an average airline, why fly it then ?? its direct to hcm, 8.5 hrs leave melb 13.30 in a Saigon bar by 5 , great stuff . but they are late , do cancel a lot and the food and service is crap, direct is the only asset"
558,sevvynuneaton,5,A number of people I have spoken to seem a little concerned about the quality of this airline because it is not well known in the west. This particular flight was one of five I took with Vietnam airlines within Vietnam or travelling to Cambodia.  All the aircraft were modern airbus planes and I could not fault either the aircraft or the crew. This might be a young airline but it operates a modern fleet of planes with what appears to be a very well trained staff.
558,Muntzie M,3,"Plane was delayed, forgot our special meals had to constantly ask for refreshments, staff were not attentive and a couple of the males were quite rude. Couldn't understand the pilot had poor English. But that's ok it isn't a English speaking country. Took away from the trip over from Melbourne Australia"
558,Muntzie M,4,"Check in staff at Melbourne Airport terminal were fantastic, the flight over was perfect. Cabin staff were attentive and looked after is the whole 8hrs. Our connecting flight to Danang from Saigon was acceptable as it was a short hop"
559,Charles Jake C,5,We flew from Ho Chi Minh to Danang.  Then Danang to Hanoi.  Then Hanoi back to Ho Chi Minh.  Great customer service and travel was safe and comfortable.
559,Sharon K,3,We flew from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh then onto Hanoi. Bad part of trip was that our bags were not checked through so we had to collect go through customs and recheck at domestic for Hanoi. Getting a visa at Ho Chi Minh is sooo bad so try and get it before you travel. The airport staff can barely understand our English to ask for help. Check out the flight and visa before you go and save your self a lot of stress. Nothing is done quickly and we almost didn’t make our flight.
559,Macgutz,4,"first time on this airline, found to have good leg room and the service is good. Will fly with them again."
559,1959Mac,4,"Premium economy flight return to Vietnam. Definitely worth the money! Wider seats, a leg rest and reclining seats - that doesn't impact the passengers in front or behind you. The extra space is incredible. Seating is 2 - 3 - 2<br>Have always found the staff to be polite and friendly. The food and service is good, and more importantly, the flights run to schedule."
559,riaburke996,3,"Flew withVietnamese Airlines. Booked ourselves business class, it’s a long journey and we wanted the comfort of being able to stretch out and get some sleep also.<br><br>The staff on both the outbound and the return were smart and well presented. They sometimes took a few times of asking to get your orders right.<br>Although they worked hard<br><br>The menu was a limited choice for food as was the wine list.<br>They did however have a lovely French white.<br>But the choice was just of 4. <br>Although they had a larger cocktail and spirits menu.<br><br>The soup, salad and main course came on one tray and not separate.<br>Which to me was a waste as I had only asked for the main course.<br>I’ve never flown with a airline that does not offer a cheese plate. Or a Port.<br>This is an international airline and should reflect its clientele as I’m sure all clients like to try varied cuisine on the menu.<br><br>There was no Duty Free offering onboard.<br>It all seemed a little below par.<br>We have flown business and first with many airlines before and I would say this was a little lack lustre.<br>The reliability of the airline was also not too good.<br>The internal flights were delayed on both sectors internally from Hanoi to Da Nang or had schedule changes applied.<br><br>All in all it was just an average trip, nothing special.<br>In fact our friends had asked how much it would be to upgrade to business on the international leg.<br>They quoted $1400 each. <br>Not good enough to warrant the business class price tag I’m afraid.<br>And because of this I would use an alternative airline if going to Vietnam again"
560,E_Sin15,5,Very good airline. Big plane with friendly and professional cabin crew.<br>I like this company for my trip from vietnam to far city because vietjet or airasia don't do these route
560,mrwangShanghai,1,"We bad a very experience with this company. They made mistakes with our booking.<br>I was with my wife and my 2 two kids. <br>We had to wait more than hour and a half, without knowing if we could take our flight of HCMC or not. We finally passed the check-in and to run to get our flight.<br>Arriving at HCMC, we had to go to VA counter to check for our domestic flight, which was the day after, to Phu Quoc, and spent 2 hours at the airport.<br>Never fly with this company again !!!!"
560,886annie6060,5,"We came back with Vietnam Air and were able to upgrade to an empty seat beside us, so we had three seats between the 2 of us, which made an overnight flight much more comfortable, food was good, toilets clean...just wish they did a Brisbane route. <br>Would definitely fly with them again,"
560,Mickey C,5,Great flight with a well trained crew that couldn't do enough for us.  Always there to help make the flight great!
560,Erigal364,2,"Hoped and expected more from Vietnam airlines. Plane was incredibly hot and uncomfortable for one, secondly I thought I’d have a traditional Bloody Mary on the flight and within 40mins of taking off they had no vodka or gin.. on a 12 hour flight from London! Food was poor also. Came back via Thai airways and had a much more enjoyable flight!"
561,Rune T,4,This was a short trip. Everything worked very well from the check-in to luggage delivery. I was very early but I could still check in my luggage.
561,Graham W,4,No issues for the online booking as I am from Dubai. Fast check in. Good service on board. Have used them for internal flights too. Would use them again.
561,Paigedene,5,A group of 8 flew internationally Melbourne to Ho Chi Ming City / Saigon &amp; a domestic flight HCMC to Da Nang and return in early March. All communication at check in departure points were easy and all Flight Attendants were very warm and welcoming! I would definitely fly with them again - Thanks Vietnam Airlines!
561,Karin S,3,Nothing special at all. Everything is very simply. SImply food and drinks. I booked this because of this is the fastest way between this 2 cities.
561,Gabriela S,4,The seats were very comfortable and large. I didn't feel when we took off and landed. Even we booked for economy class they served us refreshments for free.
562,Ann846,5,This was our first time flying with Vietnam airlines we booked with them as they are the only airline to fly to Vietnam direct from London. Both international flights were on time with pleasant cabin crew and nice food. We also had 2 internal flights HCMC to Da Nang and Hue to Hanoi both were on time time and we got a drink on both flights. No complaints  and would happily recommend and use again.
562,Mark C,1,"The first thing I have to say is never ever fly with Vietnam airlines!<br>Our flight from Saigon to Hanoi.... delayed 2 hrs. Our flight to Dong Hoi delayed 8 hours which meant we lost our day in Dong Hoi!<br>Now our flight to Dalat has been completely cancelled which now means we have to cancel hotels and tours that have been paid for. Plus pay for more time in Hoi An which isn't cheap!<br>I have never known such a disorganised, unprofessional airline ever. Especially when we just got an email 12 hours before our flight saying sorry but basically too bad we cancelled your flight. Please think twice before using this useless airline!!! Absolutely and utterly disgusted!"
562,Keeve90s,4,Friendly crew. Helpful. Just boarding and time delay. Did not have wifi. Meal provide not very nice on fish meal can be improve.
562,trucgoesplaces,5,The checkin was pretty fast. Seats were comfy and did tip back aisles were wide. They offered snacks throughout the flight and meals were nice. Glad that I always choose to go with Vietnam Airlines as it helped me to assimilate travelling especially with further distance.
562,Silboldbrad,4,"First time with Vietnam Airlines for an Internal Flight.   As a large framed person. OK Heavy.   I was expecting to be squished into a small seat as is the case with many Asian Airlines.<br>Well I got a huge surprise,  lots of leg room, widish seats and very comfortable.  <br>We were in standard Economy Seats."
563,LA5885,3,My flight over was ok. But flight return was delayed. Then delayed again. Then as always the bus from landing to the terminal. It’s very frustrating. They call them Sorry Airlines by the locals in Vietnam
563,Lars B,5,"Efficient check-in, new confortable Airpus plane, excellent service also in economy class, good food, friently and helpful staff and all at a good price."
563,Lisa J,5,Full service anything you want beverage alcohol <br>Two substantial delishious meals <br>Lots of leg room <br>Large overhead cabin space <br>Fantastic blows Australia’s internal airlines out of the water
563,laylamai,5,We flew premium economy and it was very comfortable .I would prefer to fly Vietnam airways than BA. No complaints at all staff very pleasant and nothing too much trouble. Thoroughly recommend
563,HeronScottishBorders,5,"A key part of our APT tour of Cambodia and Vietnam was the free upgrade to business class on the Heathrow-Saigon leg. We cannot fault Vietnam Airlines in any way. The service was impeccable, the food outstanding, the seats comfortable enough to sleep for several hours, and altogether it has completely spoiled us for economy travel in the future!"
564,Samrot,5,"The time the flight departs is grease, 9pm. And lands at 9.15am.<br><br>The service was lovely and food fairly good. But the flat bed was very narrow and hard . All in All it was ok but but not up to the standard of some other well known Airlines"
564,Billiedoux,5,"First time - It won't be the Last - Excellent <br>Airbus A380<br>From Check-in onward, the Service, Help, and Customer Service were all First Class.<br>The Standard of Cabin Service, the manner, and appearance of all the Cabin Crew, also should be commended. <br>Excellent selection of drinks available, great food choices to suit European <br>and Asian palates. I had the Fish main course,  which was particularly good.<br>I decided to Upgrade my trip to Premium Economy, which after travelling in this class with other Airlines - I  have to say - <br>It was the Best Premium Economy I have yet experienced. Certainly well worth the extra when you have an 11 hour flight."
564,alanbowie1,5,Good flight in both directions.Suprisingly decent food as l don't like spicy food or noodles  The cabin crew were very attentive and polite . In flight entertainment was  good also .
564,dieulien2310,1,"I took the flight from HCM to Hongkong with one more package (my wedding photo) last Tues. on March 13, 2018. I was very disappointed with the women (her name is Thu, Nhung maybe.., I'm not sure) who was working at overweight department inside HCM international airport. She is kind of unfriendly, unprofessional and arrogant on her way she answered client's questions, also get customer run around to find out the best way to pay the overwight fee instead of help them kindly. She also talked to someone when client got in line and waiting for her, and another women (she worked at information ticket) was next to her just finished her job then took me in and help me done my payment while that was her job. How badly services!"
564,UKfoodie56,3,"A good flight with good product for Economy Deluxe product. It was full with non-Vietnamese passengers. We paid for both outgoing and return flights in business class but had to downgrade to ED as we were changing our return date and no more seats available in business class. It was fine and we were happy. One thing I do not understand when checking in at TSN airport, a senior ground staff did not give us invitation card to the business class lounge. I did make query but she insisted this is Vietnam Airlines' policy. If she is correct, I am afraid to say this is our last international flights with Vietnam Airlines from London. Good luck and good bye !"
565,FredrikB_SWE,3,"Nothing speciell. Easy trip, easy to flight with. Only 20 kg was allowed on my ticket. Just booked this for ok price and also good time."
565,SrikanthSivaraj,3,Flight delayed by many hours. Airlines announced refreshments for passengers and retracted it right after. No staff at hand to check regarding arrangements. Airlines seemed clueless and unresponsive.
565,Mark F,3,Booked this because the schedule worked. Pricing of Vietnam airlines is very sharp . Check in excellent 2 mins. <br>They have a lounge which is big but like all of the service it's just all a bit dated and average. Sort of late 90s. <br>The plane felt newish pilot was Aussie which was good but decor and service are all very average . Don't get me wrong superbly polite but the seat is very dated no inflight entertainment and dinner drinks service just ok in fact SQ economy is better....much. <br><br>They could easily do more. For the price it's ok.
565,bandit153,5,"First experience was great.  Very comfortable and the service was better than the US Airlines.  The flights are on time and will fly this airline again, hope it is just as good.  The people of Vietnam should be proud to maintain and operate an airline like this.  The US should take lessons.  It fast, cheap and on time what more can you want or expect from an airline."
565,panasia,3,"The agent at the check-in counter consider a back pack with a tablet and 2 books as 1 carry on luggage. So if you have another proper carry on ( max 7kg), it's considered as a second piece of luggage and it is not allowed! You will have to pay 40K Vnd/kg and check it in."
566,Zinny1946,4,This was a short flight. Planes appear older. Service on board was very good. You got a hot meal on a 1.5 hour flight with wine. Plane was good. Staff were pleasant. Departed close to schedule.
566,BlackiesGirl,4,"We flew Sydney to Ho Chi Minh and 3 flights within Vietnam making our way to Hanoi where we flew home, we found Vietnam Air to be one of the better ones we have used over the years. We flew premium economy and it was well worth the extra money, the seats are big and wide, the extra leg room is amazing. There are only 35 seats in that section and you are well looked after. The only issue we had is on the long haul flights they did not have us seated together even though we were booked on one ticket and we are husband and wife. But I stood my ground I was not leaving the checkin counter until they changed it. We had even emailed them making sure we were together prior to leaving. Other than that I would fly with them again anywhere, flying premium you also get extra baggage allowance on all flights and we were able to board early along with business class. The Air Hostesses were really lovely and caring and the food was pretty good. <br><br>Sent from my iPad"
566,Mit_besten_Absichten,4,"I flew with Vietnam Airlines from HCMC to Nha Trang and return 12/14 March 2018.<br>Nice clean cabine, very friendly, professional crew. Take off and landing on time. Lots of seating space - leg room even for tall passengers like me (196cm). Comfortable seats.<br>A few minor points: only water was served during the duration of the flight approx. 50 minutes, not all crew members speak sufficiently english, otherwise a very good trip.<br><br>Gate waiting areas a bit cluttered and not as clean and comfortable as the plane."
566,R B,3,"I will break this down into 2 parts.  Check-in and flight.  <br><br>Baggage and meal was included in airfare and was a good deal on this flight sector (Saigon to Singapore) compared to budget airlines where I would have paid extra for this.  <br><br>Check-in:<br><br>I flew out of Ho Chi Minh Airport.  I can’t say this was a positive experience.   More than 45 minutes in the check-in queue.  When I got to the check-in person they asked me about my visa.  I thought they meant Vietnam so I showed them my APEC card.  She then said no, Singapore visa.  I explained I don’t need one (Canadian passport).  In addition I explained furthermore I was PR in Singapore.  She then asked for my PR proof.  I said it is electronically linked to my passport.  She kept asking for proof.  So I told her if she wanted proof to call immigration in Singapore.  I asked her why she was asking for all if this but didn’t get a clear answer.  Meanwhile she goes to supervisor and asks something and comes back and says OK.  So seeing as they appeared to have wasted 10 minutes in this process (after waiting to check in 45 minutes) I go ask the supervisor what this was all about.  Supervisor tells me the check in person didn’t recognise the Singapore code on my APEC card.  I asked her what this had to do with anything as my passport (even without my PR) is valid for entry into Singapore. So at the end of the process I have absolutely no idea what the issue was.  I am sure they were doing their job and there was something in their process that required them to ask some questions.  It wasn’t clear to me what it was even after asking and they came across as not knowing what was going on and made me wonder if this was the reason the check-in was so long.  <br><br>I was luck I had an APEC card so I could get through the immigration process quickly and have tome for a cup of coffee before the flight.  The immigration queue for everyone else was probably 1/2 hour.  This is nothing to do with Vietnam Airlines, of course.  But when you add the lengthy check-in queue with this , even if you arrive 2 hours before your flight you may not have any extra time.  <br><br>Flight:<br><br>Meal was included in the fare.  Was nice compared to budget airlines.  Flight was comfortable and air crew friendly."
566,Moira N,4,"Very good service, food good, comfortable seating, all good even after 13 hours in flight.<br>We were given blankets, pillows a small washing/toothbrush/shaving kit and drinks were available throughout the flight if you asked for them. Crew were very professional."
567,ECWorld,4,"Thot I was getting Cathay but operated by Vietnam Air, first taste of this airline.  Aircraft a bit old but other service fine and food also okay"
567,Cris626,4,We flew in February this year economy class plenty of leg room in normal seats very good service but lots of children on board I think that this was down to it being tet in a few days time so was a little noisy but all in all very good flight
567,tusith2018,5,I travelled 3 short distance sectors on this airline. Staff is very friendly and helpful. They provided only water or coke but I would glad if they offer tea or coffee insted
567,Mike S,4,"I have flown Vietnam Airlines many times and most recently a couple of weeks ago. Admittedly, we flew Premium Eco, a few bucks more for an all around better experience. We checked in at the Bus/FF counter no problem, fast and efficient. Cabin and seats fine and attentative staff. Food very acceptable. Perhaps wine service could have been better, you had to ask for a refill rather than being offered. Audio visual entertainment extensive, with current releases. One of the better Asian airlines and we'd have no hesitation in flying with Vietnam again."
567,MattwalesNorthWales,2,"Check in at CTU was an unmitigated disaster. I fully understand that a lot of their business may be catering to Chinese tour groups, and that is presumably the reason they have a groups only check in counter. That said all three desks were totally gridlocked with tour groups consisting of confused and excited old Chinese ladies. The check in staff were unable to control these people and so single travellers like myself were forced to wait out the storm. Meaning that even though I was there 15 minutes before the desks opened it took an hour to check in. The ill feelings were compounded by the ""priority"" lane standing empty with two staff doing nothing to help. Finally we were on the plane and the cabin crew, again were unable to control the hordes of old Chinese ladies who repeatedly decided to change seats , use the toilet at innapropriate times and simply use the business class end because the economy class end was busy. If I had paid the business class premium, I would have been very unhappy. My advice to Vietnam Airlines, know your customers and train your staff appropriately."
568,Nguyenha1981,4,"The price of VNA compared to other airlines is quite high, it is said that: we pay for what we have. Quite right for this :)"
568,Simon K,5,"Very smooth operation. Absolutely no problems other than a rather long queue at check in. Staff were friendly and helpful, we got seats with plenty of leg room without asking. Catering is minimal but appropriate for a one hour flight."
568,nyomansuparta97,3,"It was my first experience flying with Vietnam airlines. The check in counter was very helpful. I supposed to be flying with VN 165 at 10.50am, but they changed my flight into VN 163, and that was helping me so much after my long journey from Sa Pa and arrived at Hanoi airport at 4 am. I really appreciate it. For a full serviced airline, i was a little bit surprised, i thought they will give is a snack just like garuda airline did. So, they only gave us an option of coke and mineral water, not even coffee or tea. Just that. Their inflight magazine is nice. The landing is smooth, like it."
568,Manambur S,5,It was a non stop long haul flight and the staff were really helpful. No delay on both trips. The food was good and adequate
568,AllenLance,4,"I booked my ticket in August 2017 to fly in March 2018 so I got a great price and booked business class since it is easier to change flights. I flew from Danang to Saigon earlier had used the very nice VIP Lounge at the Danang Airport. Nice food, pretty girls and comfortable seats. Had a nice seat on the plane up front,  a kind of silly looking sandwich for the meal and a small cup of water. They could probably improve on that. On the return from Saigon to Danang it was much the same with a somewhat nicer VIP Lounge in Saigon with nice food, pretty girls and a good atmosphere. Same kind of silly sandwich on the flight and the sealed cup of water but the flight is only about an hour and a half. Nice comfortable seat but they play some goofy Canadian TV show of people being spoofed that to me was quite childish but that is what pop culture is these days. The Vietnamese on board all thought it was funny stuff so I guess it works."
569,Carol and Ian,2,"We had upgraded to Premium Economy but there was no premium economy baggage tagging, nor was there priority boarding. I felt sorry for the Business Class people because they didn't get priority boarding either and had paid far more for the privilege.<br>We were delayed by over an hour at Ho Chi Minh City due to technical difficulties. You expect this on occasion with any airline and better to sort it out before you take off !!<br>Bearing in mind we had already 'hopped' from Siem Reap in Cambodia and spent over 5 hours in HCMC you can appreciate that when we eventually departed at 01.40 all the passengers were tired, hungry and thirsty.<br>The meal was served within the first hour. There was no drinks service beforehand.<br>The food was unpleasant and undercooked and served with half a plastic cup of wine.  or soft drink. Vegetarians seemed to get an extremely poor deal with both meals in flight. A request for an additional drink was met with a surly response from the female cabin crew who appeared to be very tired.<br>Following the meal we were 'issued' with a 500ml bottle of water and that was the last time we saw cabin crew for over 6 hours.... maybe they thought we were all going to sleep!  They themselves were going to sleep as when my husband visited the toilet he witnessed that for himself<br>Our in flight consoles were faulty so we did not have any in flight entertainment during the 13 hour flight.<br>Halfway through the flight, many of the passengers started sneezing and coughing. This was due to something being emitted in the air conditioning system possibly an allergen or perhaps something to do with the cleaning processes. Either way it resulted in a number of people feeling unwell.<br>We have flown on the Dreamliner many times, one of its bonuses is the oxygen provision which enables you to arrive feeling refreshed...not on this occasion.<br>The breakfast served before landing was no better, I don't think many people would like pork in gravy with noodles at that time...female cabin crew still surly.<br>It was unfortunate that this flight ended a wonderful tour of Vietnam and Cambodia with a bad experience. We had flown 5 times within the tour with Vietnam airlines and albeit they were only 1 hour hops went without issue.<br>We certainly didn't experience a premium economy flight or service. I think the cabin crew require a little more training to understand the requirements of their passengers."
569,FantasiaSurrey,5,"We had two short flights with Vietnam Airways, HCMC to Hue and Da Nang to Hanoi.  We would happily had longer flights.  Both were very comfortable.  Plenty of leg room and seats were wide enough.  Short flight, 1 hour, so only soft drink served - wouldn't have expected otherwise.  No time for in flight entertainment."
569,Tony B,5,"These guys were excellent, we used them on 4 internal flights throughout Vietnam including trips to/from Bangkok and they were excellent.  Despite each trip only being between 1hr and 1hr 30 mins long, we always got a snack of some sort."
569,bshittours,4,"I flew Vietnam airlines December sydney via hoh chi minh to frankfurt.<br>checkin was easy , cabin clean not to old and used. seat comfortable but miss the mattress and pyjamas from qantas . food and service excellent for my liking and the cocktails tasty and refreshing. staff ever so helpful and friendly. will fly Vietnam airlines again. the only thing I didn't like was the coffee it was horrible and I didn't like the coffee cups but that is my personal taste."
569,Francine C,2,"Notwithstanding the official policy on assistance pets, Vietnam Airliines has consistently shown disrespect of its own rules. We traveled from Paris to Hanoi , assured that the reservations for the pet were done, but the airline has no code apparently for this situation, so we had to go through discussions and paper work lasting for an average of 45 minutes to get on each flight; from Hanoi to DaNang, from DaNang to Nha Trang, from Nha Trang to Saigon. Every  single time, it was a nightmare to have our assistance pet registered in cabin.I had my docs translated in vietnamese but it did not matter. Even when finally getting approval , we had either  to pay, call an official to walk us through security, sometimes putting the dog through the x-rays and always being seated in the last row in the bathroomsand even when seated in the plane, to have an official telling us that the captain would exercise his discretion to accept our pet. This happened from Paris to Hanoi and from Da Nang to Nha Trang.  It seems that no one had an idea of the airline policy, but moreover even when reading the policy on the internetor as printedby myself, they were not bound by it. My advice: Do not travel with a pet in Vietnam!! Vietnam Airlines has made our trip a total nightmare and we willnever. Ever travel with this airline again, with or without a pet. The airlines representatives are rude, unprofessional and lack knowledge of their trade. If Vietnam Airlines does not want assistance pets in cabin, it should just plainly change its  official policy ."
570,petra5256,5,"Can only speak for upgrade to Premier Economy. Service excellent.<br>Provided with plenty of drinks, food etc. Had overnight flight and really appreciated comfy seats, blanket, pillow, socks and slippers. A long flight but made very comfortable.<br>Food not bad but flight attendants excellent."
570,PaulPSydney,4,"Flew on new 787 aircraft Sydney to Hanoi Premium Economy and Business Class return. Both legs were excellent for the price. Seating in Premium was the most comfortable I have ever flown in that class, would definitely recommend it."
570,June G,5,It's the first time we have traveled with Vietnam Airlines they were very good the flights were on time the food was quite good. We would defiantly fly with them again.
570,Mervyn W,2,"Departed at 11.00a.m., got one drink in first hour, lunch one hour later then nothing until about 3 hours before e.t.a. then another drink followed by breakfast. Between times no offer of any service, I think we were supposed to sleep for the rest of the 11+ hours of the flight. In-flight entertainment worked intermittently and continually scrambled, I was told “there’s nothing we can do about it”. Didn’t see any smiles from flight crew between London and Hanoi."
570,Melody Yap,4,"Food offered on the flight was delicious, but airline crew seems to have difficulty serving passengers as the aisle was quite tiny and cramped and they seem to want to get the service done and over with. Otherwise the crew were all rather smiley. Seat was a bit uncomfortable, would have been better if a pillow was offered to support the back. Check in service during our return trip from Hanoi to Singapore at Noi Bai Airport was really slow. The airport does not seem to have the facility to deal with huge crowds, the whole airport just seems crowded with long queues everywhere."
571,tubab,2,"This was a night flight. The service was not what you expect from business class (we had a good experience on the flight to Hanoi). They served the aperitiv and the coffee together with the meal (so coffee was cold when you needed it for the dessert). The wine for the main course was not served at all although it was ordered before and note was taken by the crew. The breakfast was served quite late before arrival. My husband was served the wrong breakfast. He informed them that he ordered something else, so they took the wrong one and he got nothing at all. The crew was not friendly and hardly seen in the cabin during the night."
571,tubab,5,This flight had an excellent service. The crew was present during the whole flight. They were extremely friendly and efficient.
571,Keithw532,4,"I fly from the UK to Vietnam once a year and over the past 5 years have religiously flown Emirates Buisness class so a very high bench mark to compare from, but due to unavalibility this year decided to try VN Airlines instead.<br><br>I must say that I was very empressed, the plane a 787 looked almost brand new, the staff very smart and attentive and we departed exacly on time.<br><br>The 2 meals tasted great and were both presented very well with a range if quality wines and spirts also available. <br><br>Initially i thought the shape of the flatbed seat a bit odd but after shufferling around a little I probably found my most comfortable sleeping position ever on a airplane. The seat was a touch to firm though and could really have done with a mattress topper as with Emirates.<br><br>So why not 5 stars ?? Well its down to some minor things.<br>1 The flight timings causing you to arrive at 5am is a bit if a jet lag special and just makes your day difficult as you can't normally book into your hotel for several hours, its sounds minor but i struggled to wait the 8 hours until 2pm<br>2 The seat although comfortable was a touch to firm and left me with aches in my hips and when flat it really needed a topper<br>3 We seem to have missed a meal, lunch was served shortly after take off then it was another full 7 hours until the next meal service (breakfast).<br><br>But dispite these minor things i would still 100% recomend this flight for a very good, comfortable sevice with well trained and very pleasent staff."
571,Shezke,4,Flying on a smaller plane within Cambodia/Vietnam is a little different from International flights.  A bit more cramped and I can't really understand why meals are served on such short flights (1 hour 45 minutes).  Staff had to scramble around to be able to serve and then clean up in time for landing.  Otherwise the flight was pretty good.
571,Ginny F,5,They were lovely and easy to deal with -a very relaxed atmosphere. Nothing was too much trouble. They went out of their way to make it a great experience.
572,Briantravel,3,"We flew Vietnam Airlines Sydney to HCMC , then Hanoi , and return recently and were underwhelmed by the experience.<br>All flight left later than advised time, and last one was 45 minutes late, due ""service issues"" ?  We were told (at HCMC) that we could collect a free 'soft drink' at the Business class lounge on level 3 as compensation, but when we got there , they knew nothing about it,a d we were given no doubts we (as economy class) were not welcome there !<br><br>Food was average, service was brisk and business like, so they could get back to their  rest positions no doubt.<br><br>In Flight entertainment would be great if you were Vietnamese, because they was little there to appeal to Western tastes, I think.<br><br>In their favour however, I must say that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is as comfortable an aircraft you can get in economy class, and the Vietnam airlines aircraft were quite new."
572,Dexplorer_sg,5,"Didn't really have high expectations for Vietnam Airlines, but was really pleased after my flights with them. Food on outgoing and return flights were good and portions were more than adequate, was glad to see they do not cut back on what they offer despite the short flight time. Seat pitch was really good for the short flight and the seat itself was comfortable. Cabin crew were excellent, on the return flight they went out of the way to serve my fellow passenger a vegetarian meal even though he wasn't able to request one before the flight. IFE is non-existent but for a short flight this wasn't an issue. Checking in was smooth and checked bags arrived properly at their destinations. The sale price wasn't too bad, just double that of a budget carrier's base fare. Will definitely fly again."
572,Paul C,4,"Very happy with flying Vietnam Airlines. For an Aussie it would compare to Quantas :). The lines and processes to board the planes are ""busier"" than Australia, but that is to be expected in a Country of 87 Million people as opposed to 25 Million people. Also note that in a smaller country with a larger population the residents are more ""comfortable"" with standing ""closer"" to each other, than I am accustomed to, but Hey... You are on Holiday :) Relax and Enjoy."
572,Sagitaur,3,"I needed to be at the DAD by 7am for an 8.10 flight.  First problem was to get there.  Tried Uber - no, they would appear to be not in business anymore, at least in Da Nang.  Grab Taxi - no, it was too early for them.  Mai Linh - could not get the call centre to understand where I was.  Not good.  I managed to walk the 500 metres to the main road, where a scored a taxi passing by.  So I arrived at DAD by about 6.30am.  Check in was efficient, as I was able to use the Business Class counter.  Due to privilege, the check-in staff reallocated me to row 10, right behind the business class bulkhead.  Otherwise, I would have been stranded down the back with my ""online allocated seat""; last time I bother with an online checkin!<br>Again, due to my Priority status, security was a breeze (special line for Priority members), the only hassle being with security where you almost need to take everything off - shoes, belts, watch, jacket; I guess that is normal these days.<br>Off to the Lotus Lounge for breakfast (keeping in mind it is now just before 7am).  <br>The business lounge has been moved, and remodeled.  On the surface, it is a big improvement on the old lounge.  But don't judge a book by its cover.  When I arrived there were no staff, apart from a cook in the kitchen.  Some food was laid out, consisting primarily of Vietnamese staples such as sticky rise, and instant noodles.  Fruit (but not too fresh) was glad-wrapped, and looked (and tasted) tired.  However, the coup de grace was the ""hot food"".  There were 3 bain-maries:  one with cold left-over bolognese sauce, one with cold spaghetti, and one with cold hard-billed eggs.  Who know how-long this food had been sitting around (when a staff member finally arrived she advised the all the food had been freshly cooked at 4.30 (I presume she meant am, but it could easily have been pm the day before!).     Honestly, I do not know how Viet Nam Airlines can maintain their 4 Star status with the SkyTeam membership.<br>So after a banana and a cup of team, I was onto the A321; again, the Priority pass saw me in at the front of the line, and I did not have to battle with the rest of the passengers getting on board.<br>The flight itself was fine, and deboarding was a snack, as I only had carry-on bags.<br>If it was not for the terrible lounge food and lack of service, I would give VN a higher score, due to the way they have upgraded the check-in and boading for Priority passengers. But they really need to do something about the lounge."
572,Steve S,4,"only a short hop on this internal flight , so things not that important , got us to where we needed to be"
573,Steve S,4,"nice dream liner plane great service and comfort no problems at all no complaints , food ok for airplane"
573,Trish C,4,"Good budget airline, nothing too exciting. Check-in was easy, the staff were friendly and helpful. Seats were a bit old and worn, with not much leg room."
573,paul j,4,"Was very late but that seems the norm here.  Plane very clean and everything worked. Was warned about turbulence but very mild, hardly noticeable. Very efficient again and no real wait for baggage"
573,paul j,4,Short flight of less than an hour yet flight crew still found time to serve towels and a bottle of water.  Plane was clean and everything seemed to work.
573,Stephen L,4,"Travelled with Vietnam Airlines a few times in Asia. Always fine, comfy seats, nice service.A good airline"
574,second row,4,A decent flight with ok food and excellent lie flat seat.Service friendly and efficient and flight arrived early.FiLM/tv choice poor but alround good value flight.
574,Grant T,4,Surprised by the level of service. Check in and bag drop only took minutes with no queuing. Staff were friendly and helpful. Flight dearted on time (although we had to board via steps) and was surprised we got a meal as the flight was less than 2 hours. Food quality was great! Baggage claimat the destination was quick - probably less than 10 minutes.
574,Wallace R,5,We have travelled this route three times now and each time have found Vietnam Airways both comfortable and efficient. The check in procedures were flawless. The staff were both attentive and courteous.
574,Ray H,5,"The flight was short and sweet. The seats were cleaner and bigger, with better leg room than the International flight we took to get to Vietnam. We would definitely fly with them again."
574,138JoeS,5,We had an overnight flight from Ho Chi Min city to Melbourne. Business class lounge is OK but not to the standard of some Australian business class lounges. <br><br>Meals were very good both in quality and quantity. Great selection of wines and spirits- top quality. <br><br>Lay down bed was a filly reclined flat bed. So for me it was lights out and awake in time for breakfast. <br><br>Flight crew were very attentive. <br><br>Great value for money.
575,janineswanborough,4,"I have used VN Airlines for many flights, from Australia and local travel when in Vietnam. <br><br>Have found the service exceptional, food is hot and fresh, hostess very accommodating.  I would prefer to use this airline over some of our australian airlines.<br><br>Customer service is of a high standard and would recommend this airline."
575,56772013,3,The flight left 30 minutes late. I thought the security levels were not very stringent. There were people openeing the overhead lockers when the seat belt sign was on and even going to the toilet. When I wanted some water I went to the service area and found all the staff fast asleep.<br>They were polite and kind and the aircraft was neat and tidy.
575,mikemoran737,5,"No delays - check-in fine, flight called on time and departed on time, in-flight snack and drinks free, landed on time after 1-hour flight. Handled efficiently by Laos Airlines."
575,Dara-Khmer,4,"Traveling frequently between Cambodia and Melbourne, Vietnam Airlines is my preferred choice,<br>Not lavish but the introduction of Dreamliners and functional service together with the advantages of a small airport stop, makes it a good choice"
575,DerekCC_12,3,"We decided to fly to Saigon business class on their new Dreamliner planes, I did not check out the seating arrangements on line first, big mistake. The seats are in a V shape with a divider between them at the top of the V and your feet at the bottom of the V ( its not easy to describe just trust me OK) so if I wanted to talk to my Wife I had to lean uncomforably forward and it is very difficult . The trip seemed to take forever as a result. We have had better economy flights than this, plus I am 6 feet 4 inches tall and the seat was waaaaay too small so I slept in the fetal position all night. Then there was the food, it is essentially economy food with a napkin, waste of money"
576,Marc196150,5,"We were upgraded from Premium Economy to Business Class through Optiontown for 380.-€ p.P. on the FRA-Hanoi flight. And it's been worth every Euro. We were very satisfied with the service provided during the flight - Dinner and breakfast were served like in a 5-star restaurant - The seats could be reclined to a flatbed and the big entertainment screen with a huge choice of movies made us feel like lying on a sofa at home. Although being a 10.5 hr flight we have not been bored and even were able to sleep for a few hours. We would fly Vietnam Airlines again without hesitation and we can only recommend the Airline. It was a perrfect flight with very friendly flight attendants and a very good feeling of security as pilots and attendants were speaking to passengers after the start , in the few cases of turbulence and before landing."
576,Chuck B,5,"Super service on both legs of our round trip flight from Beijing, China to Hanoi.<br><br>We traveled both Economy and Business Class.<br><br>Flight attendants are as good as any in the world.  Flight was smooth and the captain kept us informed the whole way.  Food was above average for airline food.<br><br>We've also flown Vietnam Airlines domestically in Vietnam on a previous trip several years ago.  Experience was great then also.<br><br>I also watched a wonderful Vietnamese film (The Tenth Month) on the flight to Hanoi.  Really enjoyed it!<br><br>I highly recommend Vietnam Airlines if you are in the Asia region."
576,BoHua Huang,2,"Poor seat and exactly no entertainment on flight.<br>As I am the platinum member of Delta Airlines, I am so the elite plus member skyteam.<br>However I cannot choose the seat nearby the exit!<br>Terrible regulation which is said you shall have Vietnam language skill if you would like to have exit seat.<br>They offer local beer which is tasty but no more good side.<br>As I fly to Phu Quco and transfer in Hanoi, I choose Vietnam Airlines and then I am free for Vietnam visa! This is the only advantage if you choose to fly with Vietnam Airlines. The Vietnam Airlines Lounge at Hanoi lounge is just fine but the lounge at Ho Chi Ming is quiet bad!<br><br>因為是要飛往富國島,所以選擇在河內或胡志明轉機<br>這樣是免越南簽證<br>其他就真的無法評論<br>越南航空,椅子與機艙環境水準非常不好<br>也沒有提供機上的娛樂設施<br>另外,我是達美航空的白金會員,是天合聯盟的超級菁英會員<br>但是,我不會說越南話,所以,我不可以選逃生門的位子<br><br>越南航空的河內專屬貴賓室還可以,有燕窩飲料,不錯<br>胡志明的貴賓室,服務差<br>以上"
576,Likesmifood,4,After two 4 hour car journeys a short hop from Hanoi to Da Nang was a welcome change.  Air travel certainly takes the strain on this one.
576,Likesmifood,4,No complaints on this short hop from Luang Prabang to Hanoi. A soft drink was all that there was time for but better than nothing and more than expected.
577,886annie6060,5,"Never done a long haul flight only internal flights in Viernam....with Vietnam Air.<br>Considering it was Tet new year the flight was great. .the toilets clean...<br>The food good. <br>The check in was very long the queue went  half way around the airport,..as people took boxes and boxes of stuff back to Vietnam,..other than that it was great."
577,Mic F,4,"For $200US I got an upgrade to business class for a non stop overnight from Ho Chi Minh to Melbourne. Full size bed, lovely service and woke up feeling ready to go. Not quite as “polished” as some other airlines maybe but very friendly, clean&amp; comfortable all the same. Definitely recommend it to others!"
577,ronnieleetravels,4,"I have flown on Vietnam airlines for 15 years. I have enjoyed most of the flights and the service is done very well. Like all airlines these days , the seats could have a little more room but over all I like Vietnam airlines."
577,rcoimbra,4,"In February I've made several flights and none was on time, one was late for 5 hours! The others 1 hour and a bit less. The plains are good, better then expected, the crew is also nice too. They give a water in every flight, its nice."
577,connief68,5,"lovely comfortable seats, attentive staff.can not fault. and the cost difference between economy and business is not that huge."
578,Steve M,3,"Vietnam Airlines reminded me of flying on nearly every regional airline in the States.  Medium and short-haul routes, minimal service and standard legroom.  Nothing stood out but that is not necessarily a bad thing, nothing really wrong, either."
578,kennguyen2018,5,A reliable airline to use when you are in Viet Nam. Good setup for online booking. Staff are professional and pleasant. A surprise flying experience for a Guest from North America.
578,MylaBailey,4,"We flew on a prop plane, so had the normal disadvantages of that vs. jets.  Plus, a few of the seat backs were broken, so there were a lot of apologies for reclining into people unintentionally.  That said, the flight was smooth, the service was good, and all personnel were friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate to fly this airline again."
578,figuerasluis,4,"Experienced the Eastern hospitality, wad treated nicely in a 90 min flight that was delayed a bit due to a thunderstorm. What I couldn’t stand was the meal that was served. Maybe for Asian people could be alright but for some Western did not.<br>I had to say that, in favour of this airline, my partner couldn’t come and even if the non-refundable ticket was issued, after a claim, it was fully reimbursed."
578,FrPaKr,3,"We flew premium economy from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh.<br>The seats were great, plenty of legroom, and the food was great too.<br>The movie selection was not good - really a very limited selection, which is not ok when so many movies can be made avail especially so easily.<br>Also the boarding process at Sydney was ridiculous - rather than larding families with young children via one queue and business/first/premium economy via the other queue (priority boarding?) they held everyone up while they boarded the families with young children via just one queue.  Really poorly managed, and definitely not with a smile!"
579,Loic M,1,"Appalling customer service following big (6.5 hour) delays. Really disappointed with the service and totally inadequate response to my complaint.<br><br>Our flight was diverted to Kuala Lumpur - admittedly through no fault of the airline, but this was announced through a cursory, garbled message from the air steward with no reason given apart from 'the airport is busy'. No further information was provided or reassurance given to passengers until the flight landed, when we were informed of the air temperature, local time and welcomed to KL. And then told we should not leave our seats as they would refuel and let us know our new departure time.<br><br>After nearly two hours on the tarmac (during which time the only information I could get was by text from a friend watching the news in Singapore), we were herded off the plane and into a waiting area (without toilets, food or drink - though we can queue to leave the lounge, through security to get to a toilet). <br><br>After 2.5 hours we were given a little pot of orange juice and some cake. Nearly 3.5 hours on we still had no news and not a single member of staff was in sight, no further food, water, or anything else was available. <br><br>After four hours there was finally a curt call for “business class. Children”. From this I deduced that perhaps the flight would be departing and asked the lady making the announcement who said we would hopefully be leaving at 8pm (approximately 4.5 hours after our scheduled departure time). I suggested to her that it might be worth making an announcement to let others know this.<br><br>Back aboard the plane, we were finally provided with a bottle of water each at 19.50 (4.5 hours after the situation began) and a small box of chips each.<br><br>At 8.05 we were welcomed aboard, and finally, at 8.10, the plane started taxiing, but of course, once we landed things still weren’t ready and we did not disembark until 9.45, 6.5 hours after the problems began and with very little apology or attempt to help in any of that time."
579,Lester Y,1,"Booked Business to fly Ho Chi Minh City to London to (hopefully) get some sleep and be prepared for more travel and family commitments when we arrived in UK. Was looking forward to first trip on a Dreamliner, and especially in Business Class - what a disappointment.... why oh why do airlines let you spend a significant 4 figure sum extra to book ""Business"" class and then allow babies and toddlers in ""Business"" who spend most of the 13 hours in the air screaming, crying, and running around? Absolutely dreadful flight and a waste of the extra money. The lie flat seat was the worst i've been on since Delta near-recliners nearly 20 years ago - the seat frame between the seat cushion and the back-rest was not cushioned enough and was positioned right in the small of the back, and the space for legs/feet was so cramped it made it impossible to lie in any position other than on your back. Almost impossible to sleep; especially given the constant crying and the fact that there was a constant stream of people from the the other cabins using the toilets at the front, with no attempt by the cabin crew to intervene Food average, film choice poor, drinks service brief (and meagre). Cabin crew spent all the time not serving ensconced in their galley and. Will not be travelling on Vietnam Airlines again even though our Premium Economy flight out to Hanoi was actually not bad."
579,eylana g,3,"The flights are always delayed, they don't tell you that in advance though, so you sit and wait at the airport forever. Very frustrating. The staff is overworked and so has no time to be kind."
579,Johnston47,4,"Arrived at airport 3 hours+ before flight and stood in long queues for over an hour before service,was very glad to get a seat and a coffee after the ordeal.The plane was nearly an hour late in taking off,once in the air we were served a beverage and lunch which was very nice,the staff were very friendly and the plane was reasonably clean. We had a good sound flight and landed in Ho Chi Minh only 30 minutes late. We recieved our luggage fairly quickly from the baggage hall.I would fly with the airline again."
579,AsianExplorer,5,"Got an invitation to the lounge and fast pass for free at check in. Super friendly staff, smooth flight and lots of leg room. Even the food was pretty decent. I‘m impressed with this airline."
580,Laurent D,1,"Ridiculous... unprofessionnal... i asked them to hang my suit, as done by all companies in the world. One stewart told no, not possible. It makes me very upset because this is a small request because their cabinet is not used !  they have a long way to become an international airline company or it wasn't the good crew !"
580,peter n,4,Flight on time. Staff efficient and friendly. Food edible. Inflight entertainment ok but movies a bit limited. Seats reasonable and a good supply of water.
580,vkveur,5,"I have used Vietnam Airlines twice over the past few weeks and on both occasions everything has worked like clock work. Short queues at check in, on time boarding and departures, clean spacious cabins, professional staff, on time arrivals and speedy luggage delivery. Reliable and efficient ."
580,JeromeNG_WK,5,"Best courteous and best smile flight attendance, flight on time, smooth flight though on that day there were a little bit of strong wind. Ground staff very cautious and attentive, they spotted my luggage has small tidy broken hole, it was there before i take their flight, immediately they make clarified with me. Next time i did like to try their long haul flight to Paris."
580,Holly S,4,"Staff is very helpful and friendly. The planes are clean and seem less densely packed than delta’s economy seating. Even on short flights they offer a small nice meal. We were pleasantly surprised and happy with our trips on VN Airlines <br><br>We also flew from Siem Reap to BKK with a stop in SGN. The flight leaving Siem Reap (Small Planet Airlines, a partner of VNAL) was a full hour late and we never did hear an announcement as to why. When we landed in Ho Chi Minh City they bussed is to the terminal where we had a bit of a hike to the VietNam Airlines connecting flight. Turns out it was delayed as well and we never did hear why so we didn’t miss the connection. <br><br>When boarding, everyone is very polite.  Not pushy or rude."
581,JuneJaundoo,5,"My first ever long haul flight of 11 hours, l was really not looking forward to this. But from check in, where we were allowed to upgrade to premium economy for a fee, to landing, l couldn't have wished for a better airline. The plane was a dreamliner, itself a  comfortable craft. Service and standard was exceptional. Arrived feeling like l had just got off an hour long flight! We returned in economy, and were very impressed with that too. I would not ever worry  using this airline. We also had two internal flights during our trip. These were on time and clean with good service too. Luggage reclaim on all the flights was quick too! 10 out of 10 Vietnam Airlines."
581,MarieKaren631,1,"This airline is indescribably horrible.  I could not get on my flight because their computer systems are adequate.  They left me stranded at the airport.  Don’t let them ruin your holiday as they ruined mine. <br><br> They have not given me compensation.  Not ever returned my calls or emails.  Their US office is uncommunicative,  Their customer service is nonexistent!!!!<br><br>Heed my warning.  Do not trust this airline.  They ripped me off completely and offer no redress for their mistakes and incompetence. <br><br>Vietnam Airlines  - you should be ashamed."
581,Burrows_79,5,"Im used to flying Qatar airways so it takes a lot to live up to. But Vietnam airlines was great, the seats were spacious and the meal was nice, all staff were attentive I would definitely fly with them again"
581,figo-fee,4,"From check on to baggage pickup this airline was perfect... on board crew friendly and efficient....good aircraft, on time."
581,Simon B,5,"I had a perfect flight with these guys. There was leg room, lunch which was very nice. Great staff,  landed on time. Was all round happy with everything.  I definitely recommend this company and will be using them again"
582,kenb106,5,We did 2 internal flights with this airline and both flights were on time and the service on board was excellent. A.lthough there was no inflight entertainment the flights were only just over a hour each.
582,Helgeroa123,4,"We had to very comfortable national flights, from Hanoi to Danang and from Hue to Ho Chi Minh City. The planes were unexpectedly big and the flights very comfortable with smooth landings. For the not Vietamese speaking passengers it was a bit difficult to find out where to go on to airports."
582,BigblueSweden,3,Flew with the new 350-900 from Germany to Vietnam. The configuration offers great privacy and the latest techical ameneties. But from a service point of view they have some work to do. I never once got the right meal. Wrong food or wrong beverage. Or both. Always friendly though.
582,Sarah M,3,"Had 3 flights with Vietnam Airlines during my stay there. In the time between booking and the flights the departure times changed numerous times, so it's likely best to check online for the most up to date information, but it can be difficult to keep track of (especially when you've printed your tickets). The flights had no in-flight entertainment.<br>On the plus side, they were inexpensive flights, and got us where we wanted to go."
582,Brian C,4,"The flight between Dalat and HCMC is all of about 40 minutes, so there is time to hand out some water bottles, but no food.  The aircraft doesn't even reach cruising height before it starts to descend!<br><br>But, despite that, the service is excellent!<br><br>The check in woman was friendly and considerate.  She offered me the emergency exit row because, as she noted, I have long legs.  Much appreciated, even though it was only a very short flight.  None of the global carriers have ever offered me that on long-haul flights where it is far more important, and yes, I check in as soon as possible, online where possible and otherwise at the airport.<br><br>The cabin crew speak very politely to the passengers, locals and foreigners alike.  They are tolerant and patient with everyone, including those who don't speak Vietnamese, the elderly who move slowly, and so on.<br><br>Vietnam Airways seems to be a professional friendly and welcoming airline."
583,malimu,3,not good meals  seats so so in business but very chaotic at counter. i did arrive early n believe me they had unilaterally put me in this earlier flight. imagine arriving late n no next flight. cabin service for business class was so so. i only took this just in case econclass was like carrying cattle tho it did not look like it as i never took this airline b4. take take Vietnam air flight i guess but do arrive lot earlier for ck in. i dread taking airline with compressed seats like MAS.
583,KruChris67,3,"The seat itself was too short. That made sleep impossible and led to pain in my thighs.<br><br>The service was outrageously bad. Asked for a noodle pot or some snack. Was told ""breafast will be served in an hour"". Mean staff - as if their salary depended on NOT handing out drinks &amp; snacks. I kid you not. <br><br>The airline's executives should fly KOREAN, SINGAPORE or some other high end airline and learn a thing or two about serving drinks &amp; food.<br><br>Boeing probably was under pressure to fit in more seats. Shortening the seat's cushions has been a clever trick to accomplish this. TBH, 777 or A-330 or A-340 or A-380 or the old  747 seats etc. have  n o t  have this issue. (And cheap EUROWINGS with no option to recline had a more comfortable hard seat. This pressure near my dangling knees was seriously unpleasant).<br><br>They were cheap and I liked the 30 kg checked luggage limit.<br><br>THAI's better though, JMHO. (I have flown THAI on the same route)."
583,Emma B,4,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines numerous times during our trip to Vietnam and Kambodia. <br>1 out of 6 flights departured when it was supposed to.<br>They were very good at informing us about these changes a few days in advance, and the new flights took off only with a few hours difference.<br>It was never about the flights being late, I think they just didn't sell enough tickets and then just re-arranged all the passengers to other flights the same day.<br>Friendy crew and fast luggage handling."
583,Ray C,5,Brilliant service lovely food and a very comfortable seating arrangement. As good as any business class service I have used. Would definately recommend. Booking seats was straightforward and airport check in was hassle free.
583,GrahamJubb,4,The plane was modern and clean and the service was very good. The food was surprisingly very tasty because most airline food had deteriorated. The entertainment system lacked variety. I watched Bonnie and Clyde for old times sake.
584,FrPaKr,4,"The seats were ok for domestic business class.<br>The flight is not really long enough to enjoy the usual business class frills, but it was nice to get the “business class” bus (no direct access to the plane) and priority luggage.<br>The price was not much more for us when we booked so worth the little but extra.<br>The business class lounge at Ho Chi Minh City was nice, with an ok selection of things to eat.  The business class lounge at Phu Quoc was nicer than sitting at the gate (crazy) but there was not much food to choose from, and it was not being replenished."
584,Nice_FranceMichel,4,"Pretty good short domestic flight with this airline.<br>Departure and arrival right on time.<br>Good on board service, thanks to a dedicated and gentle crew.<br>Overall an excellent experience."
584,largogoldoni,5,"My husband and I travel to Sydney and it is half way across the world. A horrendous flight experience usually. <br><br>This time we thought why not travel Vietnam Airlines 787. We had a three day stopover in Saigon and then flew on to Sydney. Impeccable service plus we adored Vietnam. <br><br>Our flight back was equally impressive. Unfortunately I was ill, vomiting from Sydney to Saigon - due I suspect to migraine. The staff looked after me beautifully. Ordered a wheelchair in Saigon and took me to a sleeping pod for our time in transit.  Onwards to London was equally impressive. Landed on time, and from plane to car just over half an hour. You can’t get better than that. Will always travel Vietnam Airlines and hopefully visit that beautiful country again. Thank you"
584,cxcartist,3,"I just traveled to Vietnam from HK and experienced 4 different flights, HKG➡️SGN, SGN➡️PQC, PQC➡️HAN, HAN➡️HKG. The flights duration varied from 1h to 2 1/2h. I had a great deal for the 4 flights. The experience was pretty uneventful through out. I was surprised they served meals for international flights as well as domestic longer that 2 hours with choices of 2 entrees. It wasn’t that good but better than peanuts or pretzels. The planes were a bit old and seats looked rundown with only ceiling tv screens. The flight attendants were efficient. On and all for that price I’d travel with them again for short flights."
584,Inlook,5,"The flight was very short, had time for only one beer in business class.  There is a lounge that you can go to prior to the flight.  They take you on a separate bus to the plane so you don't have to deal with the crowd."
585,lixlalux,5,"We had 4 flights with Vietnam airlines.<br>Frankfurt-Hanoi business<br>Hanoi-Vientiane economy<br>Luang Prabang -Siem Reap economy <br>Saigon-Paris premium economy <br><br>We discovered an awesome business class<br>on our 12 hours flight to Hanoi.<br>The A350 is an amazing aircraft, the seats extend into a fully flat bed, the flight attendants are super friendly and the food <br>of high quality.<br><br>On  our 13 hours flight to Paris we enjoyed the premium economy class in the A350.<br>The seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of legroom.It’s worth to pay a little bit more to enjoy the advantages of the premium economy for such a long flight.<br><br>The 2 shorter flights in economy were fine too and all 4 flights were on time.<br><br>We will definitely fly Vietnam airlines again!"
585,Beth S,5,"Our holiday got off to an unexpected unpleasant start when my partner came down with food poisoning as we left Sydney Airport. The staff of our Vietnam Airlines flight were incredibly kind and helpful. They put him up in business class to allows him to lie down and we’re extremely attentive to our needs for the entire flight. They kindly let me sit with him, and even provided me wit a business class meal, saying “I had to eat something”. We couldn’t have asked for better service in an unpleasant situation."
585,shockbn,4,Every things are standard. Flight fare was inexpensive by using an offer at beginning of the month reserving while several days. Best thing is the direct flight.
585,Debra 'n' Alan J,5,arrived at the airport and got through check in no worries boarded the plane for out 40 min flight with no problems got given a bottle of water on the flight out.<br><br>flight back was delayed by 30 min but not a real problem airport is large so plenty of shops to look round check in and boarding were fine no complimentary drink on the way back
585,Jacquii W,5,Cannot compliment Vietnam Airlines enough. The flights were comfortable and plenty of food and refreshments. Staff were terrific. They brought us back to our family safely. There was plenty of space. Thankyou
586,Khai D,5,"A direct connection between Saigon and Yangon. <br>The flight was on time departure and arrival<br>The airbus 320 is so clean and new<br>Friendly beautiful Stewardess<br>Very competitive price<br>Because of just 2 and half hours flight, the entertainment in cabin is very limited."
586,Robert  F,4,"We have flown this airline a few times and the crew is courteous and helpful, and the flights were on time. These were short flights, so we were served a little box lunch that was rather bland and more symbolic than real food."
586,Raghu S,5,Very punctual. A very smooth flying experience with cordial and hospitable in-flight crew. The vegetarian food was delicious. The host/hostess are there to serve your needs without a frown which is appreciable.
586,Paul W,5,"It’s sometimes tricky flying on a non English speaking flight. But, this was trouble free, plane in good condition and crew helpful and polite. Of course the food is Vietnamese and was typical airplane quality. <br><br>Would I fly with them again. Yes"
586,Douglas R,4,Very good service. On time very good service.Food was very good especially if you chose the Vietnamese options which were very tasty. Only niggle was wine was poor and in very short supply.....you are offered a very small glass.....but then is that a bad thing?Maybe not. Interior very clean and toilets well stocked and cleaned regularly.....they even have shaving foam and razors!<br>Our first time and I would recommend and fly again.
587,Gail Goldman,4,"We had a good experience. Boarding was easy and there was ample overhead space.<br>The legroom was sufficient and the crew was pleasant. Additionally, the flight was on time. They even served a small meal for a short flight."
587,paulm2101,5,"Superb service, such polite and respectful crew. Very nice food, Asian and Western and a super comfortable seat which folded to a flat bed. Cabin seemed still in very good condition."
587,barry e,4,"the seats were ok. but like most economy seats a bit uncomfortable, inflight service was ok. flight entertainment ok. foodwas quite good. overall it was fine and i would fly with them again"
587,Paul A,4,"For some reason flying club with BA is not the semi exclusive experience it used to be, pay for seats, indifferent cabin crew experience, I'm glad to report that Vietnam Airlines see it rather differently. With a reasonably young fleet and also with young eager cabin staff to see to their customers with a smile and  good service, flying suddenly becomes a semi pleasurable experience, I say semi because any flying today is just a way of getting to your destination before your real holiday starts. I can recommend them, hope they don't change and become cynical like the more established airlines."
587,Paul D,5,"The planes are new 787 dream liners and are great, they are very quite, the toilets are bigger, entertainment system fantastic, also bigger windows that block out at a touch of a button. Service was great and the food very good, together with the unlimited drinks the flight was great."
588,Philip_Marsh,4,"Whilst using Vietnam Airways to enter the country we also flew with them on internal flights. It was obviously different from international flight but it was still pretty good.<br><br>The travel time for Can Tho to Hanoi is just 2 hours so to be honest I just expected a standard flight. There is less leg room than an international flight and no entertainment but there was food (a luncheon meat sandwich and a lemon and coconut jelly.<br><br>In comparison with European short haul it compared favourably although, again, the stewards/stewardesses didn't smile very much."
588,Philip_Marsh,4,"The airway reminds me of someone who has just learned to ride a bike; everything is done very properly but somehow it isn't very relaxed.<br><br>Experience:<br>1. BOARDING: All passengers are called up together (rather than by section) and passengers are segregated at the gate itself<br>2. SAFETY BRIEFING: Via video only.<br>3. WELCOME: With a face/hand cloth (wet wipe rather than hot towel).<br>4. REFRESHMENTS: Pretzels and a drink are served first, followed by dinner (about 2 hours in to the flight) and breakfast 2 hours before landing. They also provide a bottle of water each.<br>5. FOOD: Good and tasty.<br>6. SEATING: Comfortable with enough leg room (I'm 6 foot tall).<br>7. ENTERTAINMENT: Limited.<br><br>I would be more than happy to fly with this airline again although the staff don't smile and they aren't too good at resolving problems. As per the title they lack some 'soft skills'."
588,Ann W,5,"On Time very comfortable very good food and served with a lovely smile , drinks available couldn't fault the airline"
588,JThF,4,our flight from BKK to HAN  ( and visa versa ) was perfect on time and the on board service was very friendly  ; due to a illness our original flying days had to be changed from september 2017 to january  2018 ; we got our september flights perfect refunded and could decide so when to fly in january. The airliner makes e very professional impression with a modern fleet. With the app check in was easy
588,Sophiree,4,This airline was good for me. The service was professional. Staffs were friendly as well. They served me a nice dish on the plane. The interior and exterior of plane was also nice.
589,Ishimiagi,5,"The interior of the planes are well maintained and the seats are comfortable. We were served good food for two shorter flights and received a lot of refreshments. The staff were all friendly and smiling, firm when necessary with unruly passengers. We even got moved to seats with more leg room due to the height of my travel partner."
589,John V,3,"The plane was an ATR 72 prop-jet. The flight left right on time and arrived as scheduled. Given the small size of the plane the airline staff were very particular about the size of cabin baggage so don't try lugging anything more than standard sized cases on board.<br><br>No snacks, drinks or entertainment was provided other than a small bottle of water."
589,Nolwenn C,1,"I didn't even took the flight yet : I bought the ticket online and they charged me twice the price of it (1300 instead of 650). After contacting the customer service, they said they will refund me... In 40+days! I'm a student in university exchange, I don't have this amount of money. I'm now broke and I don't even have enough money to pay for the train to the airport. I explained them the situation and they didn't change their mind. I'll have to cancel everything and live with my friend's food for the rest of the month because of them. How is it even legal??? <br><br>Avoid this company at any price"
589,Kit F,5,A smooth uneventful flight with pleasant crew. Only water served as it was so short. The Danang airport was spotlessly clean and he check in process went smoothly.
589,stephane3361,1,I flew VN before internally and it is a low cost airline comparable with Ryanair in Europe.<br>I thought that on international route ( even short ) it would be different but it was as basic.<br>I will never book VN again even if cheaper. Bangkok Air and Silk Air are way better.<br>Poor image of that country or maybe at the image of the country!
590,Jennayyyee,5,"We recently spent a considerable amount of time in Vietnam and had been advised ahead of time to stick with Vietnam Airlines for any air travel.  Even though it is more expensive than most of the other options, we were told it was the best and to not bother with any of the budget options. I am SO glad that we listened to this advice. We departed on time every single one of the FIVE flights we took with them during the course of our time in Vietnam. They always provided refreshments, even on the very short flights. The staff was helpful, polite, and very professional. This airline is very efficiently run and I would recommend it to anyone traveling within Vietnam."
590,Peter K,4,"Flew Vietnam Airlines for first time as it was much cheaper than other full service airlines. Expected it to be similar to budget airlines like Scoot and Jetstar due to the price and was pleasantly surprised. The flight departed punctually, in fact they started boarding almost 40 mins before flight both in Australia and Vietnam (this was the case for the other internal and return flights we took) and everyone queued up orderly to board with no queue jumpers. Service on board was efficient and polite, and food was OK, mainly asian but with western selections for some flights. There were alcoholic beverages and English movies on board though a limited dated selection. It is a young airline with room for improvement, and planes are not as flash as other full service airlines (a dreamliner for the long haul flights in my case) but for what you pay (which in my case was less than what some ""budget' airlines were charging), it was great value and definitely better than expected."
590,Gerarddunn,5,Wow - short flight - and we got a meal?  Fantastic.  Inexpensive flight to Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh (Saigon).<br><br>Seats were comfy - service was excellent and flight left and arrived on time.<br><br>Bags were delivered promptly - no issues<br><br>MUCH better than my debacle with Emirates a few days earlier.<br><br>Very pleasant surprise.  Thank you Vietnam Airways.  I will use you whenever I can.
590,Rachel H,5,"Actually we didn't travel with the airline but when we arrived to Hanoi it turned out that our luggage was left in Moscow during the transfer. We had to travel to Da Nang that day by Vietjet, but still had to report our missing bags to Vietnam Airlines. The lady who assisted us was extremely kind, helpful, flexible and professional. We explained to her that we cannot travel back from Da Nang to Hanoi the next day to get our bags so she organized to deliver them to Da Nang the next day - even though we personally didn't travel with them. I don't know, maybe this is a normal protocol, but we were really surprised in a good way. Our bags was on time the next day just as she promised. Really nice experience! :)"
590,Susan W,5,"Good flight no service as the flight is only 50 mins it’s like using a bus, you just get comfortable and it’s time to disembark"
591,lawdylawdy,4,"Let me start by saying I generally loathe long-haul travel - the airport, the security, the sitting around, the jet-lag.  OK, that's out of the way, so, to business.<br><br>VA fly out of Terminal 4, Heathrow.  Who'd have thought that getting through check-in and security at LHR is amongst the most efficient and slick of any airport I've flown through.  Not just T4, either; we've flown from T3 and T2 within the past 18 months and they're good, too.<br><br>We flew VA to SGN because it's the only airline flying it in a single hop.  We ran through the VA lottery to upgrade to Premium Economy and managed the upgrade both out and return - the Premium Economy class was full, though, both ways.  Good, comfortable seats, plenty of leg room / seat pitch allows a good recline without knocking the teeth out of the person behind you.<br><br>Service was good in the sense of charming and efficient when asked for, but the drinks service could have been more frequent and more varied.<br><br>Star of the show - the aircraft.  Boeing Dreamliner....... what a beauty.  Quiet, quick, no rattles..... travelling outbound, with the prevailing wind behind the aircraft, the cabin display showed speed-over-ground at 630 - 650mph most of the way and at one point I saw, fleetingly, 690mph - astonishing speed for a wide bodied jet.  Bit slower on the way back, mind - 580/590 into the wind, so a couple of hours extra flight time.<br><br>The secret of long haul travel is, as always, noise-cancelling headphones / earpieces.  What a difference - sleep is easy."
591,VinaTraveler,5,"Vietnam Airlines is the only airlines that operates to Con Dao Island from Ho Chi Minh. The Airlines was on time, the cabin staff were nice as well. The only thing is that the price is quite high, it costs me USD$200 for two-way flight which could've be more cheaper since, it was only a local route or within Vietnam. Hope they could lower the price of this route, so, I can still consider coming back to Con Dao, Vietnam."
591,Therese H,1,Flew Premium economy Not in class of service above <br><br>It should be against the law to have reclining seats in an areoplane especially in premium economy you literally have to jump your seat to get out to go to the bathroom.<br>And I mean the two in front of us had there seat reclined all the wat even when I asked her to put her and her sons seat up a bit she made out she could not speak English. <br>So much for Vietnamese being friendly ha. Ha
591,jarasta,2,Everything would have been fine but for a couple of things.  There was a hassle with one of us getting our ticket at the counter.  Everyone's tickets were arranged with first and last name but the only Asian member of our group who had to hassle down to the wire to get a ticket.  There was absolutely no reason for this.  The consolation was that they got us past the long line of security.  This name problem probably  wouldn't have happened in the international terminal office.  And we had to bus to the airlines both ways instead of a little walk to to/from the plane in the airport.  Maybe the domestics go the cheaper route.  And finally the flight was twice as expensive as the other airlines (which has a terrible reputation).
591,sheilaowen59,5,Seats comfortable for long haul. staff so nice and helpful. Choice of food and good quality. In flight entertainment was excellent. Toilets kept clean and fresh.<br>Would fly vietnam again
592,wardster12,2,"Uncomfortable poor service work experience cabin crew.food cold,drinks service diabolical.should have flown emirates,far more pleasant."
592,Gert R,3,"Bussines class seats are ver uncomfertable if you are very tall  I am 1,98cm and it is not possable to completely flat.  Foot space is not enough.   Seats are very hard.<br>Food on the flight is very average and tasteless.   The staff is very friendly <br>Checkin is a breeze."
592,DY60,4,"Basic, efficient service<br>Sometimes there are delays due to weather and/or late arrivals<br>However, I would stick with them over the local carriers which can be unreliable and unpredictable."
592,lynhdan,3,I booked Vietnam airline flying out from Bangkok because I wanted to fly out of bkk airport and not dmk.  I’m not really a fan of the dmk airport. I feel the service could have been a little better. The flight was only about an hour or so with meal and refreshment was included so that was a plus.
592,Ydna82,5,"We chose the premium Economy flight and were delighted. Service was good, seats comfortable and we had ample room. In flight entertainment system was up to standard."
593,kw,3,"Flew with Vietnam airlines from Heathrow to Hanoi as it was a direct flight and they have Dreamliners.Plane ok,staff pleasant when you enter the plane but that is where it stops.Food and drink service is minimal.I wanted a gin and tonic no gin so had vodka and sprite,normally you are given the miniature bottle of spirit but I had to share this with my friend. Drinks were not offered regularly. You are given a menu to choose meals but on out going and return flight they had run out of the meal that most people wanted.If service is important to you don't fly with Vietnam airlines.<br>We did internal flights in Vietnam with Vietnam airlines legroom was."
593,Carol H,4,The cabin crew offer a good level of service.  The flight was reasonably comfortable for a long haul flight and the entertainment is okay.
593,ruth d,5,"Hi the above would not allow me to put correct to and from.  All flights were internal<br>Hanoi to Danang <br>Danang to Ho Chi Ming <br>Ho Chi Ming to Siem Reap<br>Siem Reap to Hanoi<br><br>All great on time kind flight crew, actually seemed happy to have you on board unlike most US airlines.  Services great comfort same as US airlines cost less than $100 per trip all in all a great experience"
593,Knausir,4,"Vietnam Airlines uses modern airplanes with midrange age on regional flights. We had 4 flights and all were delayed. This flight was 2,5h late, Hanoi - Da Nang 45min, Hue - Ho Chi Minh 30min and Ho Chi Minh - Bangkok 1,5h.<br>So its really helpful to calculate extra time in your trip when flying with Vietnam Airlines."
593,Purjelentaja,3,2 domestic flights with Vietnam Airlines.  Onboard only water served. Schedules were changed twice between booking and date of flight. Both flights were late.
595,Michele C,5,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines many times both international &amp; domestic &amp; have found the service, comfort &amp; meals all excellent."
595,dromilio,5,"Great flight home, travelled with my daughter and a good friend. We were very tired as the flight arrival time was midnight. Once on board the flight attendants made us all very comfortable. The plane was not full so we were lucky enough to have 3 seats to ourselves and slept until we arrived in Sydney, best flight ever."
595,karla014,5,"Had the opportunity of fly twice on this airline on a recent trip to Asia. Both times had a great experience. Excellent service, attitude and comfort."
595,145nick,3,"I can't say it was bad but really average.<br>Staff not very friendly. especially when serving meal.<br>food was really so so, and beverage same... for a 12.30h flight !<br>video service very limited.<br>aircraft was good (A350) and flight on time that was good.."
595,Mehul Kirit Shah,5,It is very good domestic airline. Vietnamese people are very friendly. Staff is very generous except few. Co-operating company flights can get cancelled so please avoid. Vegetarian meal has to be told prior 24 hours before.
596,Hardtoplease75,5,This was a smooth flight on a beautiful day. The flight attendants were very attentive to our needs and there was more legroom than usual which made me happy as I have long legs and neuropathy so the extra room really helped.
596,kathysellers,3,This was our first time on Vietnam Airlines and it was just fine.  Seats were comfy and legroom was OK.
596,cqfp123,2,"I fly over 100,000 miles a year on various airlines. With this airline I flew LAX-LPQ, a couple of domestic flights within Vietnam and back HAN-LAX.<br>This airline may be ok for domestic flights within Vietnam, however I don't recommend it for international flights if you have an alternative. In particular, AVOID codeshare flights with China Airlines at all costs.<br>1) Rudimentary website. Online check-in possible only from selected departure airports.<br>2) Poor integration with other SkyTeam partners. They sell tickets on China Airlines flights and then wash their hands of it. China Airlines treats passengers who purchase their tickets from VN as pariahs: no advance seat assignment, no online check-in, only the worst seats even for passengers who have SkyTeam status. The two airlines (both SkyTeam members) blame each other and the passenger is caught in between.<br>3) Minimal or no assistance, or even information, is provided in case of delays and cancellations. My flight TPE-HAN boarded on time, but then failed to leave the gate. After about 30 minutes, the pilot made a casual announcement that there had been a “technical problem” and the flight would depart in 5-10 minutes. The flight did not depart, but no further announcements were made and no updates were provided. It was obvious that something major was going on because there were several people coming and going. I asked the crew several times what was going on, but they ignored me. Eventually a flight attendant told me there was a problem with the door not closing. 90 minutes past departure time the pilot announced that the flight was canceled and all passengers were asked to disembark. No assistance was provided by the ground staff. Passengers were given temporary boarding passes for another flight nearly 6 hours later. No meal vouchers were given. Later I had to stand in line at the gate for 25 minutes to get my new boarding pass. They refused to give me the new boarding pass for my subsequent flight (which I had missed due to cancellation of my original flight), so upon arrival at Hanoi airport I had to spend another 20 minutes at the transfer desk. I ended up reaching my destination 6.5 hours late.<br>4) To add insult to injury, I was denied entry into the Vietnam Airlines lounge in Hanoi because the flight I had been rebooked on was operated by a non-SkyTeam partner (Lao Airlines)! Even though they were responsible for the cancellation of my original flight. they refused to let me in. They insisted that it was ""the policy"".<br>5) None of the flights operated by VN had USB ports or power jacks.<br>After I complained to Customer Service, they offered me a $100 refund."
596,PlatinumSwe,4,"Just a little bit more expensive than the low cost airlines but very convenient with the direct flight a bit over one hour. <br>Smooth check-in, boarding and flight. Staff on ground and in air have sufficient knowledge of English."
596,Graham S,4,Flight was on time leaving the terminal. The seating is comfortable with more leg room than most of the airlines that we have traveled on in recent times. As this was only a very short internal flight there was no food service but drinks were available. Friendly service and very Profesional cabin crew.
597,TommyATC,4,Vietnam airline is the best choice when traveling around Vietnam. There is reasonable cost and good service. It is more expensive than other carriers but I strongly recommended.
597,Happycats3,5,"I was a bit dubious about travelling on a ""3rd world"" airline. Well my fears were completely unfounded when I boarded the latest dreamliner. What amazing service and great pilots to go with it. I used this airline internationally and internally in Vietnam. It was efficiently run and the log in system at the airport very modern and fast.  I would highly recommend them."
597,Steve F,4,"This is the second time we have flown Vietnam Airlines business in a year, and while our experience on this occasion was still very good, IMO their standards have slipped slightly. The cabin staff seemed a bit rushed and disorganised compared to the first flight. I will fly Vietnam Airways Business whenever I am going to Vietnam, but it will be interesting to see what experience the next flight brings"
597,Anna F,5,"For a person afraid of flying, I easy recommend Vietnam Airlines. This was only a 45 min flight, proffesional staff, wet towels and water. Flight on time and easy check-in. I will fly with Vietnam Airlines again!"
597,Jules E,4,"I found the online services very poor compared to my usual flight experience. I was unable to check in online or reserve seats. <br><br>However, email service was good and I converses with the airline over disabled services and the lady was able to ensure we had seats together even though we could not reserve seats. <br><br>We got to the airport early and went through bag check with no issues. The staff member was great and we got the aisle seats I needed. We then had to walk the length of the airport to get a wheelchair but that is not the airlines fault. <br><br>Going through security was expedited by the wheelchair and everyone was really helpful. Going through the gate and onto the plane was brilliant and the cabin staff made sure I was settled comfortably and showed me how to call if I needed anything. <br><br>The seating was excellent and way better than I was expecting! We had a brilliant choice of entertainment and settled in comfortably for the 13 hour flight. <br><br>I am GF and they coped really well with that. The food was hot and really good! My hubby had a choice of meals from a menu and they came round regularly with drinks. <br><br>At Hanoi I was mega impressed with disabled services! They insisted on a staff member pushing the chair and whisked us through the mega long passport line to bag collection. <br><br>The bag collection was very slow but there was seating nearby. We left the airport very happy campers. <br><br>We also travelled back with them and again Hanoi airport services were exceptional. The flight was great and the staff accommodating. <br><br>Sadly can’t say the same on our return to Heathrow!! But that is not the fault of this airline. Apart from the online issues I would give them 10/10!!"
598,annoddnikrud,3,Sub-standard meals and staff with no personality. We know they were busy but they were very unhappy looking.
598,Marc Nouss,5,"I've traveled between Paris and Ho Chi Minh City, then Hanoi to Paris with Vietnam Airlines, first flight in Business, second one in Premium, and it's hard to find something bad to say.<br>Everything was very nice, the food and drinks too. Maybe just the stewarts and hostesses could be more smiling, and speaking a little of French when your flight is direct between Paris and Vietnam."
598,Raintree_Thailand,3,"Flight was only 40 minutes, so not much opportunity for Vietnam Airlines to distinguish or slight itself.  To their credit, check-in and boarding was smooth and the flight departed on time.  A321 plane was comfortable."
598,Micheline L,4,"I flew round trip from Paris to Hanoi in Premium Economy. It is not too expensive to upgrade to this and I recommend it. There is more leg room, the seats are wider. I was very pleased with these flights. The crew is highly professional and courteous. The food menu was varied and the food was very good. There was sufficient on board entertainment to make the 11-13 hour flights seem less long and tedious. The restrooms were spotless from beginning to end."
598,Lidor F,1,"Flight was cancelled without notice and we were booked for a flight 7 hours later.<br>The flight we had then was also delayed.<br>In addition I need to mention we had 2 additional flights with this airline, (Danang to Saigon, and from Saigon to Siem Reap), both departed and arrived late."
599,ann a,5,Great service from check in to in flight. The food was good and the aircraft was clean and comfortable.  Would recommend.  Love the Dreamliner aircraft.
599,georgelovell9,4,"I recently flew direct from London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh, the overall experience was great. Check in staff where a great first encounter. The plane was slightly dated, however was as expected from a 2015 Dreamliner. I was fortunate enough to sit in isle 26 (exit) which has excellent leg room, this really enhanced the flight. The food was brilliant and service was good. The only down side was the entertainment. The screen didn't really work, films would pause, cut off and break up every few mins. I ended up using my own iPad and book to help the 12 hrs pass (not the biggest problem ever). However this seemed to be isolated to about 10 people on the whole plane. Straight through the airport and bags collected within 20 mins. Great overall."
599,John L,4,Had read mixed reviews of this airline over the past year. The main complaint was that they kept changing the flights. I booked for December in February last year and the flights were changed 3/4 times. We were on short flights and never had any problems. The service was good and the flights left on time.
599,Ken Hall,4,"Good flight in premium economy going to Hanoi on new dreamliner aircraft.Excellent plane.Coming back we had a change of aircraft, which was not as good, but we were upgraded to business, so okay. Service was good both ways.Would fly again. Food from Hanoi to London was strange - breakfast was noodles etc ??"
599,crunchie3,4,"A Good overnight flight on a Boeing Dreamliner, seats comfortable, staff very attentive, near the back of the plane therefore no choice when breakfast was served, overall a very good airline to fly with."
600,John M,1,"We flew on three different Vietnam Airlines flights within a three week trip, with other flights on Lao Airlines, Bangkok Airlines, and Korean Air for comparison. Vietnam is a communist government business with business and technical assistance from minority partner Korean Air. Their in-flight magazines brag about how great that they are, but they really are the bottom of the bunch. All three of our flights were late, but maybe that is an Asian thing. Two of the three airplanes were newer, but one was older and smelled terrible. In all fairness, that was the one that went back and forth to the center of Vietnam where it rains about 70 inches a year with high humidity, but it did smell like they transport livestock. As a Sky Team member, Vietnam Airlines understands that they need to have separate boarding for premium class and premium members, and there are indeed two lines. BUT THEY START BOARDING ECONOMY FIRST! The did this all three times. They do have some priority lounges, but the one that I entered had only coffee, soda, popcorn, and small snacks, which is a far cry from the Delta Air luxury. The VIP lounge used by their premium members is only for premium seat customers, not premium members themselves, unlike Delta. If you are traveling within Vietnam, this government owned airline will likely be your best option, and thank goodness that the flights are usually only about an hour. One interesting but odd event was when we traveled from Saigon to Laos, and I was the only Sky Team Gold member who had special luggage tags. Our two luggage bags did arrive from the little plane into the little Siem Reap airport a full 10 minutes before any other luggage, not that it mattered, with about a 40 minute wait for visas, in the same baggage area, to enter that country."
600,Shirley D,4,"Good flight, food better on way out than on way back, but edible. Plenty of choice with films. Adequate leg space, I’m 5’9” and usually find leg space tight, but this was fine"
600,Fernandez1960,5,"Our first flight with Vietnam Airlines, they are fantastic from Customer service through to the staff on-board, we had to cancel 1 flight and change a name on another ticket. nothing was too hard for them. Flight was super smooth and staff very attentive.<br>we did several flights with them whilst moving around in Vietnam and even went to their office in HCMC to check some details. Nothing was too much bother and would recommend them to anyone"
600,Z4884GDannet,5,"We travelled to Sydney to Paris return with Vietnam Airlines in business class. The aircraft were new, clean and tidy and the staff were great. The lounges were comfortable and the seats on the plane were very comfortable with the ability to recharge your phones and computers with USB chargers in each seat space.  The meals on the flight were very good and there was a good variety. I would definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again, they were on time and couldn’t do enough to make us comfortable both on the flight and in their lounge."
600,SteveVA69,5,"Unlike most European short-haul aircraft, seats in this A321 business class were real business-class seats: two rows of large seats in a 2-2 configuration. The plane was full, but I was the only person in business. The biggest surprise was when I de-planed. The usual bus was waiting, and as soon as I was on board, the doors closed and the bus took off to the main terminal! Economy passengers got the next bus."
601,Nastya S,1,"I don't know if the flights of this conpany are good, but their customer service is really horrible. I'm trying to get a refund because of their mistake during one month. They don't answer emails, or answer and then disappear and you need to start conversation from the very beginning. I never leave reviews, but this company is so bad, that I want to warn everyone to think twice before buying tickets there."
601,ddz884,5,"We traveled in premium economy and it was fantastic, the seats were so comfortable and reclined practically flat, the staff could not do enough for you and were so polite, the food was good and drinks were plentiful. Such good value for money especially compared to BA."
601,Haim G,5,Great service with attention to detail on board.<br>Pre-boarding was expedited by checking our documents prior to actual boarding.<br>The food excellent; normally for short flights back in NA one needs to purchase the food but on this flight the meal was included.
601,Seevali D,4,"Seven of us traveled on the flight from Hanoi to Da Nang with Vietnam Airlines on Airbus A 321.  The boarding was direct on to the plane through aero-bridge.  It was a short flight of only 80 minutes.  Adequate legroom in economy class.  I had only an apple juice as we had lunch before boarding the aircraft.  The staff at check-in, boarding as well as inside the aircraft were attentive and helpful.  Smooth take-off and landing.  All in all a good uneventful flight!!"
601,markhoman1962,2,"We had the chance to upgrade, I thought it was good value (about £60 each) but it was not worth the extra. The flight was only about one hour and twenty minutes, the plane was really old and the business seats were awful. Mine was broken, the flight attendant said don't lean back too hard and it won't recline (it was stuck in recline), we really upgraded so that we could use the lounge in Ho Chi Minh, however when we went to use the lounge we were told that as this was an upgrade we could not use it. Not sure about long haul business but short haul business never again"
602,WhyteWind,5,"I recently flew Bangkok to Hanoi- quick, easy flight of 90 minutes. Got a full hot lunch and beverage service for FREE. The US needs to up its game!"
602,Simonfss,3,Rating provided on the page jumps from average to very good. A fair rating should be good for this airline. <br>Price of tickets were good when booked at promotion period. <br>Web check is allowed which saves time in the actual check in process at the airport.<br>Clean facility and good leg space. <br>Food was fine and sufficient. <br>Flight times are one per day and flight back from Hanoi was very early considering we were asked to leave just over 3 hrs to catch the flight from old quarters in Hanoi
602,Paul Z,5,"Last October I flew for the second time with Vietnamese Airlines to Paris via Hanoi.  I flew business class.  I found the flights very comfortable and the service at a very high standard. The flight from Sydney to Hanoi was in a Boeing Dreamliner and the flight from Hanoi to Paris was an overnight flight in an Airbus a350.  Both planes have a very comfortable configuration.  Meals and refreshments were equal to any other Australian Based airline.  The flight to Paris was fully booked but though overnight I managed to sleep at least 6 hours. The seat forms a bed and pillows and cotton blanket make life comfortable. Video and music are also available on a console within a seating pod similar to other international travellers. The fare return business class To Paris from Sydney was a little over $4K. Very competitive.  Travellers can also fly to Europe via Ho Chi Minh City for a similar price.  A tip for travellers to Hanoi I was told by Vietnamese that Japan has built their new Hanoi airport and also the six lane freeway from Hanoi to the airport.  It is one of the most impressive buildings and I am sure it puts similar infrastructure in Sydney into the second rate category. When accessing business class the tip is to follow the ""Priority Access"" signs.  But be aware Hanoi is the capital of a Communist country and officials sometimes become shall we say excessively bureaucratic. It is wise if travelling to Hanoi to be met by a local tour guide or a local driver who can help you to your hotel."
602,Ian P,5,"Very efficient and pleasant service from the staff both at check in and in the cabin.Food was good and in flight entertainment. <br>Whilst in Vietnam I also went on two internal flights with Vietnam Airways and again both were very good, received good service and help at the airports. <br>On the one internal flight i was offered a seat with extra leg room without asking and at no extra cost.<br>Have to say that Vietnamese people seem to pride themselves on offering excellent service"
602,LA P,5,"We used Vietnam airlines to travel between kuala lumpur , ho chi minh city and hanoi. <br><br>Service was great , discreet , welcoming and friendly. <br><br>The ambience on the plane was serene unlike usual airlines. It was quiet not mAny announcements , service was efficient , quick and to the point without unnecessary fuss. Seats were comfortable and spacious , food and drinks free of charge. <br><br>The tickets were value for money by any means unlike most european airlines. <br><br>The planes used was a mix of airbus types A321 A350 . They are relatively new, clean and with a relaxing atmosphere. <br><br>Check in at the airport was seamless. <br><br>Great experience highly recommended."
603,BernifromTralee,3,"The flight in itself was very calm and perfectly on time, and the staff on board have decent English....it is a must not to sit in the last few rows of seats at the back of the plane ......... reason ..... you are giving a menu for your flights , as we were, although by the time they get to the last maybe 7/8 rows most items are gone so you HAVE to accept whatever is left..... this happened to us on our way out &amp; same on the way back.....as my wife mentioned to a member of the staff , the possibility of starting at the back on some occasions as I would say that this ‘ no choice’ for these seats is a common occurrence..... other than that .... a pleasant enough experience...."
603,Graham K,4,"Pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of the aircraft, they ran on time, they weren't overbooked and the check in and airport signage and facilities were fine. <br><br>Can not fault them on price and services."
603,Myk S,4,"For long haul flights, business class a must. Especially on the Dreamliner. Well looked after, service on and off the plane was great. A bit sloppy in onboard service from Frankfurt to Vietnam leg (not the Dreamliner). Traveled Sydney-Ho Chi Min City-Frankfurt return. Otherwise it was 4+ stars. One could see the staff were trying hard, though their English could be a bit better. No trouble understanding the staff or they us. Food was good and just kept coming. Comfortable flat bed seating was excellent with ample room. Staff met us in Vietnam, processing our visas and transfers to and from hotel, which included a meal. A tour was included on the return leg in Vietnam during a 14 hour stop over. All included in the fare. Pleasantly surprised by the all round quality of service. Highly recommended for anyone where Vietnam airlines visits."
603,789lizy,3,"Good flight, but always running behind with their fights never on time! Also internal flights never leaving on time too. Cabin crew were lovely and also service was good too. So take a good book and hoping you are not in too much of a hurry to get there. Seats are small too."
603,vincentlO741VW,4,Is a standard airline getting good impression in term of everything. Also good for transit type of arrangement before fly to other countries.
604,doritg888,3,"The overall service is fine, crew is friendly. food was very average and the seats were pretty uncomfortable and worn out. some short movies were shown on the overhead screen, but you had no earphones. It felt save just not very comfy, but honestly the price is good and I would fly them again to Vietnam anytime."
604,Andrew4truth,3,"Pros- good value business class, good quality service<br>Cons- seats in poor condition with rips, transit tour late and forgot hotel and wouldn’t do tour as it might not get us to airport in time. Blamed soccer match but traffic less then normal."
604,Raintree_Thailand,3,"Everything pretty much average, but smooth enough.  Check-in was very smooth.  After fighting the ridiculous lines at Suvarnabhumi security and Immigration, boarding was also relatively smooth.  A321 was clean and new, but very cramped with nearly every seat occupied.  The meal (I selected beef and rice) was OK, but nothing special and the service was sketchy (I had to request a second beer three times before it arrived).  But overall, not a bad flight."
604,USDutchie,3,"Basically there is nothing wrong with the flight from Frankfurt to Hanoi, except the BUSINESS CLASS is just way too small for a person who is taller than 5""9"" / 180 cm. The flight was smooth, the service was beautiful, food &amp; beverage was OK due to the German caterer ==&gt; The food was not very Vietnamese. We are on time etc.<br>But it was a ""nightmare"" trying to sleep in these very small chairs / that fold down as a bed. It works probably very well for a vietnamese person but when you are 191 cm ........ Definitely NO. It makes the € 2000 ticket price very expensive!! That whole cabin you get in Business is just very tiny. Take a look at EMIRATES ....... perfect!"
604,fitzgeb6,1,Flew with Vietnam airlines from London to Hanoi my boyfriend's bag did not make it to Vietnam. The whole process of getting the bag was a nightmare. The airline rarely contacted him with any kind of an update he had to keep on chasing them. Even when he was in contact via email their communication was useless and English was poor. They could never seem to get a handle on where the bag even was finally after 16 frustrating days the bag eventually made it to Vietnam. Compensation for the delay was $30 given when we reported the lost bag. Would hate to see how they would handle a real emergency. Won't be flying with them again.
605,fitzgeb6,1,Flew with Vietnam airlines from London to Hanoi. My boyfriends bag never made it and how the airline dealt with this was deplorable. They rarely contacted him with any kind of an update he had to constantly chase them. Their communication via email was very poor even the standard of English wasn't great. They never seemed to know where the bag was and went around in circles for 16 frustrating days until we finally got the bag flown to Vietnam. Took 16 days to get it from London to Vietnam even though they fly daily. The compensation for this delay a mere $30 on reporting the bag at the airport.
605,SantIndia,3,"Service could definitely be improved. There were no food options for my wife and son, who do not have sea food, but wanted an option with egg or chicken, which was not available.<br>Also, in-flight entertainment could be improved by having it on every seat, rather than a common screen.<br>On the positive side, I would like to mention that we flew this airline on 2 domestics sectors within Vietnam, and found it to be the most efficient amongst the other domestic players, in terms of on-time performance. So if you planning to take a flight within Vietnam, would recommend to choose Vietnam Airlines (this was also vetted by a local friend based in Hanoi)."
605,On the road,2,"system show: Boeing 787, late on you sit in A350 without any note sorry. Siting place very nearow. <br>Foods: 2016 good menu, good display, good service equipment, after two years, 2018 they will be in the list of airline have the most horrible foods.<br>Service: 2016 complain little bit about staffs, 2018 complain more about qualities of sercive, when you complain about the foods qualities, simple answer, menu and the foods from long time the same on board, some other passinger said very goods food ans eat all, maybe they eat all cause from morning till 4pm you can put something in stormach. 2016 dessert trolley with a lot choice, 2018 one tray of cheese , pure qualities, fruits no testing, and can not buy more smile of airhorties. They are too busy and hurry to serve you finish meal and go to sleep. You bought one expensive house with lot expensive equipment, but your servel do not know how to use it, in the short time, your house will fall, become low qualities like othe neibourg in the village.<br>The  one ‘read’ note for passinger on board just pass level -AAAA, level A like me still can read fluently more than her."
605,Alison H,5,"Cabins were 3,3,3 for economy  with 2,2,2 for business, each had a blanket and little pillow waiting for you on the night flight. The back of each seat contained a TV showing numerous choices of films, in many languages, cartoons, shows, games, informational videos about places to visit in Vietnam , and headsets were given out. Two meals were served. Lunch and ‘breakfast’ ( took off at 11, served lunch at 1, I put my watch forward 7 hours, so then breakfast was served at 4 am landing  after 5 am,  11 hour flight) toothpaste and toothbrushes in short supply in the toilets, which got busy at times. But I’m looking forward to the return flight, and catching up on some movies. Cabin crew were very polite and courteous , speaking and understanding English."
605,Darren B,2,Had flights booked with Vietnam Airlines to take us from Phu Quoc Island back to Ho Chi Minh City on the day we were leaving Vietnam. When we booked our flights originally we gave ourselves over 4 hours between when we were to land in Ho Chi Minh city and taking our International flight to return home. We Booked our flights months in advance and the airline changed the time of our flights twice within 48 hours of leaving Phu Quoc. When we checked our flight the night before we left the very new departure time had changed from 19:35 to 21:40. This left us less than an hour to check in for our international flight. When I called the airline and explained this to them they said all they could do was put us on the morning flight out of Phu Quoc which would have given us 12 hours to sit around Ho Chi Minh waiting for our international departure. In the end we decided it would be best to book a brand new flight with Vietjet Airlines to take us back to Ho Chi Minh so we would make our international connections without having an extended layover. Very disappointed in Vietnam Airlines. Be very careful when booking this airline
606,Jode2019,4,For all our domestic flights throughout Vietnam which were 4 in total we used Vietnam Airlines. They always left and arrived on times. Had competent crew and made safety issues high. They allow 20 kg free luggage and for the short 1 hour trips I did provided a hand towel and water. Only gripe is they use buses to get you to the planes. No aerobridges.
606,Victor A,4,"The flight was good, no delays the service was reasonable. However in the flight to hanoi the control of temperature was very bad and very warm during whole flight. The 4 stars rate is just because the return flight was great. I hope this was only an exception"
606,feganCardiff,4,"Journey was good, plenty of legroom. Entertainment was OK, Didnt get either of first choice meals as had run out when they reached us. Registered for and got an upgrade on way back. This was excellent"
606,monicadcunha,5,"I hadn't heard a lot about this airline , and was initially hesitant to fly with them. But I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flight was on time. The staff both at check-in and on board the plane, were professional and friendly. In fact they bent backwards to assist and made you feel that it was a pleasure to do so. The foot room between seats was more spacious then a lot of other major airlines I have flown with.  Food (tasty and fresh) and beverage served (including alcohol).  I will fly  Vietnam airlines  anywhere, anytime"
606,Doris N,5,We flew Premium Economy on our International sectors and Economy domestically within Vietnam.<br>Quiet new Dreamliner aircraft provided an excellent and punctual service with smooth landings.<br>Our Premium Economy seats were at the front of the aircraft and very roomy and comfortable. The recline was excellent and with the elevated footrest provide recliner style comfort. Food was good and service efficient.<br>Our domestic flights were seamless and on time compared to the other local carrier where it appeared every flight was hours late or cancelled.<br>Would definitely fly Vietnam Airlines again and definitely in Premium Economy.
607,Junior,4,"The aircraft model was a medium Airbus, with no middle section. The seats were fairly comfortable and the legroom was standard for economic class. The food was one point that could be improved by he airline. My choice of chicken was no longer available when the service cart reached me (I had to take fish instead) aboard the flight between Ho Chi Min and Nagoya.<br><br>Outbound (NGO/HCM/BKK) and inbound (KUL/HCM/NGO) flights were basically of the same quality. The flight attendants were very helpful with our children’s needs. Better not carry so many hand luggage once you’ll have to take a bus transfer from/to the craft to the terminal in HCM, BKK and KUL. Not necessary in NGO."
607,KimAnhPleiku,5,"Good service, profesional attendant,<br>comfortable seats, thoughtful instructions, quick procedures, take off and landing gently.<br>I will choose VN Airlines for my trip."
607,Ron H,5,"I have now repeatedly flown Vietnam Airlines in business class. It is very comfortable, the service if very good and I would recommend this airline to anyone. I have found it great value for money"
607,fwlybur925,4,"I booked Vietnam Airline because it provided the cheapest fare to Korea at that point of time although I need to transit in Vietnam, but the transit time was not that long, approx. 2~3 hours. The food is quite tasty."
607,wayne m,3,"Asian legs are shorter than Western legs. So knee room on this flight is limited. A bottle of water is served, but that's all. This flight uses stairs instead of gateways. So if you have climbing problems be forewarned."
608,LouayHabib,4,Friendly efficient service with safety and convenience. Would not hesitate to fly with them again. A good mid price option in Asia
608,Chit Keong T,3,Flight is convenient.  Lots of internal flights connection.<br><br>Good selection to travel with Vietnam.  Service is good too !
608,Wayne B,4,"Great flights , large plane and great seats. Fresh towelettes and water. Pleasant staff. Shorthaul flight"
608,walter m,5,great large (and not overcrowded) lounge at Hanoi. New planes flown by English speaking crew (probably Americans although I couldn't tell for sure) -- a great experience with excellent service. They are going to start service to LAX and I wouldn't hesitate to take them.
608,Wazza_and_Ness,5,"We arrived at the airport in Sydney only to be told that our aircraft type had been changed, as we had paid for premium economy seats and this type of aircraft was not configured for them that we would have to be bumped up to business class, it was fantastic champs to start, hot towels, great food with real plates knives and forks expansive wine list, seats that lay down to beds, great audio visual system (although the movie selection was a bit old not to many latest releases) and plenty of room, and of course sensational service!"
609,Judith C,3,"This was the first time flying with Vietnam airlines.<br>Flights were on time  . Ground staff very helpful<br>In flight service was  adequate Flight to Vietnam staff were a little  remote. <br>Flight back staff seemed more engaged but whist the service was adequate things like no offer of a second drink or a coffee , explanation of food choices etc  were different from other airlines i have used.<br>Quality of food was not great  <br>In flight entertainment was OK but quite old  films<br>all in all for an 8 hour flight  service was OK"
609,jaak h,1,Plain (Airbus) and pilote were ok but food and service very bad. For a 13 hours flight we started with a horrible meal followed by NO drinks whatsoever and after 10 hours flight a breakfast with fresh drinks but no coffee or thea
609,Jerome S,5,Good company !<br>Always enjoyed to travel with Vietnam Airlines.<br>Enough space and good food and also good workers.
609,Mary-Anne C,5,"This was our first trip on Vietnam Airlines which exceeded our expectations after travelling several times with other airlines.  The plane was neat and clean, the seats were comfortable, the food was very enjoyable and the staff were friendly. We were given bottles of water and could ask for more is needed. We were able to charge our phones and iPads at our seats. We left Sydney about 3pm in the afternoon for an 9.5 hour trip to Hanoi in Vietnam and with the 4 hour time difference we were in our hotel in Hanoi before midnight. We are considering flying with Vietnam Airlines again to Vietnam and even stopping in Vietnam en route to further destinations within Europe."
609,Tigerphy,5,"It is a nice airline, like those big ones (Cathay Pacific, ANA, United Airline).  The price was good and offered a direct flight to Saigon from Hong Kong.  Staff were very nice and the hostesses were very beautiful. We got our meal and drinks there."
610,Colleen M,5,I completed four flights with Vietnam airlines and found the service from ground staff and flight crew professional. All flights were punctual and comfortable.
610,Francois D,4,Vietnam Airilines is operating from Paris with direct flights to Vietnam. Excellent service at lower price than competing companies (inclusding other Sky Team Alliance members). Possible improvement : to serve bread at the same time as the dishes (European style) instead of toawrd the end
610,Lodloaf,5,"Often fly with Vn Airlines and always find them very good. There is a little more leg room than on other carriers, not sure whether this is because the seats are better spaced or just that they are just a little higher than others but it’s good."
610,Grant B,5,First class service great plane brilliant staff ...even though it was a 111/2 hours to Hanoi the staff on the plane were busy all through nothing was too much trouble the plane was spotless best flight I’ve ever been on
610,elanagrossy,4,"It was a quick and easy flight. I had expected a snack to be served, but at least they gave us a bottle of water. That’s the only reason I couldn’t class it as excellent."
611,WasanthaSamarasekera,5,"We experienced the oneway flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi with Vietnam airlines. Check in, baggage handling, boarding and inflight services were very well performed and also punctual.<br>With unsatisfactory experience, sudden cancellations with Jetstar Pacific, if anyone want to fly around Vietnam better fly with Vietnam airlines."
611,820gyuri,3,"We flew from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City with a packed Airbus. It was classifed as a domestic flight, no upgrades possible. It was anything but pleasant - better forget it. From  Ho Chi to Sydney we traveled in a Dreamliner and because we managed to upgrade to Premium economy, we had an excellent flight. Seats were terrific, legroom adequate and the catering was pretty good. Ground service in Ho Chi airport was a nightmare. Nobody knew anything, counter staff was totally ignorant of the proceedings re. upgrading ( we have done it online and paid for it in advance). They sent us from one counter to the other and finally, when all seemed to be lost, we managed to get our upgrade.Otherwise the flight was good, smooth and the Dreamliner is really a dream.but don't fly economy unless you are very small and tough."
611,Johnkinder,4,"I used to love to travel, but now, not so much. The long flights really get me in a sour mood. The idea of a short, non-stop flight to Siem Reap seemed much more appealing. Plus, having Angkor Wat at the end of the line helped my attitude immensely. I must say that I really enjoyed the trip. Though it was admittedly very short, nothing was less than very good. The service was friendly and efficient. The plane was comfortable. Refreshments were generous.  We disembarked into a gateway and made our way through customs and the passport check. The immigration line moves a bit slowly, but once through we hired a car and driver and made our way to our hotel. I suggest you check with your hotel to see if they provide airport pick-up. Ours did, but we didn’t know. In any case the fare is reasonable and the distance to the city short. In February, for the Tet holiday, we are flying to France on a Vietnam Air non-stop flight to Paris. If the long-haul is anything like our recent short flight, it should be pretty good. I am already feeling a bit more comfortable about this next trip. I’ll let you know how it goes."
611,TalalSulaiman,3,good except that the airline does not take into consideration Halal meal alternative for Muslim travelers.
611,hiritos,5,This was our surprise that this airline was super clean and professional. We only took domestic flight which was less than an hour. We would like to take an intercontinental flight next time. Highly recommended.
612,Foodieontherun,4,most of the flights we took you would have to take a shuttle bus to the plane .Then go up a large flight of stairs like the1950. Im not sure how disable people get on the plane? old planes but tasty service&amp; great staff. Seats weren't super comfy. We also flew them with in the country.
612,Sue P,2,"While this may have been ostensibly a domestic flight we did expect some skerrick of nourishment from the airline, but not so.  I guess they thought they could get away with offering nothing at all by way of the domestic classification.  But honestly, do they think this will win them admirers and good reviews?  Not from me.  There was no inflight entertainment."
612,Puss100,5,"We enjoyed a comfortable flight and excellent service flying premium economy. Seats were spacious and it's possible to get a decent sleep in them. <br><br>We found the service and food to be some of the best we have had, and we fly fairly frequently.<br><br>The online check in process is efficient, and obviously enables you to chose your seats. <br><br>Would certainly recommend this airline, and we will definitely use them again."
612,Anh Arma'an,4,"When I flew to Paris in August, I knew I wanted to fly Business Class and on price comparing a number of airlines Vietnam Airlines came out on top. Better still, having a little time up my sleeve, I ended up taking advantage of the Ho Chi Minh City stopover to spend a few days there before flying onto Paris via Hanoi. I found this stopover so effective for my overall well being that I opted to do the same on the way back and stayed an extra 2 nights in HCMc, thus breaking the flight times to a more manageable 11 hours for the Paris-Hanoi leg &amp;, 2 hours Hanoi-HCMc &amp; two days later 8 hours for the HCMc-Sydney leg. Only 21 hours of flight time in total, not bad at all. In fact I found it pretty easy going straight into the office in Sydney form the airport when I landed.<br><br>The Business class seats were comfortable with the option of turning into full flat beds for sleep. I had a window seat which was a single seat (the configuration of seats are 1-2-1). Being a larger person I found the seating a little narrow but on the whole comfortable. Service on board was friendly and efficient with a nice selection of Asian &amp; Western dishes and French wines to choose from, and a nice but small selection of spirits too. My only real complaint was the lack of anything really brand new on the inflight entertainment. It was all things that had been around for quite a few months or classic movies. Considering that the price of a return Business Class ticket with VN Airlines is considerably cheaper than with say Qantas for the same trip. I think the inflight entertainment is really not that significant an issue. I would definitely fly VN Business Class again for any long haul flight and take advantage of a Vietnam stopover too.  Finally, the lounges at all the airports were comfortable and a welcome escape, although I only found myself using them for approx 30 minutes each time, just enough for a drink or two in relative peace. All in all a very nice first experience flying Business Class with this airline."
612,LSUTGR1,3,This airline is very clean and well-maintained. Just basics - no food or drinks on board the plane. Only water and wet towels. Perfect for getting from point A to point B quickly within Vietnam.
613,Nicola F,5,"Lovely flight. Longest flight I’ve ever done so was a bit nervous but absolutely fine. Leg room a bit limited but Service was good, flight was smooth, food was excellent, toilets stayed clean and entertainment was adequate"
613,brastedbarron,4,We opted to fly from Da Lat to Da Nang - where we then caught a taxi (pre booked by hostel : always better value than using metered taxi). The bus would have been approx 15 hours! Flights were £133 for two of us. <br><br>Da Lat airport is 45 mins down the valley from the town (170k VD fixed price.  350k VD on meter!). Good modern airport. <br><br>Plane was a twin prop for the hour’s flight. All perfectly smooth and efficient. <br><br>Vietnam Airlines only currently do online check-in for 3 major airports - ie not Da Lat - so just turn up and check-in the old fashioned way at the airport!<br><br>We booked via travel agent online VivaVivu. <br>One lesson learned : VNPay is not robust. use 123Pay - it’s more reliable.
613,THOMAS NG,5,"I rebooked the Vietnam Airline after VietJet cancelled my flight at the last minutes. <br>It was less than one hour flight from Nhatrang to Saigon. The cost was about $18 US more for the four tickets comparing to VietJet, but now on, Vietnam Airline is my top choice."
613,renshawharris78@gmail.com,5,"Việt Nam Airlines are a very efficient airline, aircraft is very well presented &amp; clean, check in went very smoothly, flight is comfortable, pleasant staff and luggage arrives in terminal very quickly. Would recommend."
613,DenJam512,4,"As we fly to Asia quite a lot this is the first time with Vietnam Airlines, The service was good and nothing was to much trouble for the staff, The aircraft was a new Dreamliner an aircraft my wife was looking forward to flying on .However we found the seats were cramped for space with little leg room compared to other scheduled airlines operating in this area. The seats were small and uncomfortable As we were at the back of the <br>aircraft we found it very noisy .We would fly Vietnam Airlines again as its a direct flight just need to take a cushion. Be prepared if you are flying onto a domestic location <br>you have to leave the terminal bags and, all, go outside  to get a transit bus to the domestic terminal."
614,fox10743,4,After a slight delay in the scheduled departure it was a pleasure to walk on to such a clean and tidy plane. The crew were very well presented and helpful. Being an internal flight there was very little entertainment (unless you had your own device). In flight service was just drinks due to the short flight time of just over an hour. In all I was very impressed with Vietnam Airlines.
614,SH C,4,"1. Good value for the money - no doubt <br>2. Depending on the airports, flights seem to get delayed quite significantly. Two out of the four flights I've experienced last weekend experienced delays. Better to get prepared for the  'de facto' delays if you are departing from or landing at busy Asian airports.  <br>3. Flight meals for Asian routes were much better than those for Hanoi-Frankfurt routes. Flight entertainment was much better for the European routes than HKG-HAN.  <br>4. Beware of neighbors. My nasty neighbors ignored my 'warning messages' and stayed completely noisy throughout the 11-hour flight from FRA to HAN. Really watch your neighbors and try to be assigned adequate seats with decent neighbors especially for longer flights. I am experienced with other airlines (I am a frequent flyer of PEK-FRA and PVG-FRA, and I've never experienced any issues with neighbors when I flew from and to PEK/PVG on my way to FRA.) <br>5. Seats were not spacious, but they were relatively comfortable. <br>6. B787 for VN36 might have been good for overall passengers, but the reduced noise originating from the aircraft would not have contributed to easing the ongoing chatting sound from neighbors."
614,BobZ9,5,Fast and ... Different than we ( US ) are use to .. taking a small bus out to the plane.. than up the stairs to board... Not too fancy inside .. No private movie screen ...  Just a drop down one with safety instructions ...  Very short flight by the time we get up to altitude .... we are on our way to land...  LOL ... only a 30 minute flight... But we were served Water and A packaged wet towel ... Not bad... and very reasonable cheep ..  About $ 50.00 ... Enjoy...
614,Jacqueline E,4,"A non-intrusive flight gets you to your next destination effortlessly, comfortably and very affordable."
614,Warby,3,"The overall flight is good and staff are friendly. The food was poor as was the drinks. The entertainment was not up to the standard of other airlines, the new release films were a few months old in comparison.<br><br>Arrival was early with good check in and boarding. Lounge in Hanoi is okay"
615,Laura N,5,"We flew from Bangkok to Hanoi with Vietnam airlines and really didn’t know what to expect of this airline. We were so pleasantly surprised! Check in was a dream, with professional staff and no wait at BKK. The plane left perfectly on time and being not a full flight we had lots of room to spread out and the flight attendants were very accommodating of passengers moving to a preferred seat. The food was actually delicious, nice and fresh and alcohol available too for such a short flight! Can’t wait to fly with them again!"
615,reginakeith42,4,The check process was quick despite economy passengers using business lane which also happened at boarding. I am on crutches and waited for early boarding for disabled and business which did not happen and although seats were reserved for disabled others were sitting in them. Some assistance to get me a seat would have been appreciated .<br>The in flight seats are roomy and you can lie flat to sleep which on an 13 hour flight was great. In flight entertainment was good and meals were just ok. Fish was for both starters if you have any dislikes better to pre book your meals. I ended up with very little u could eat. Snacks were limited but<br>Staff helpful and information in English as well as Vietnamese.
615,Salsa2020,5,We travel to the UK approximately 3 times a year. Usually Business class. WeWe are always looking for the best value for money business class service. This time we chose Vietnam Airlines. They did not did appointment . From check in it was a painless journey. The food was nice. The service was excellent. The seats were comfortable. I managed to sleep 5/6 hrs straight off. Which for me is pretty good. The seats didn’t have a mattress. The blanket could be a bit thicker. The film choice was pretty good. We were offered canapés in between meals. And drinks were
615,Neil H,4,Boarding gate close to the Lotus Lounge.  The service in the lounge and on the trip was excellent.  Seat 3A was really good.  The flight time is about 2 hours.  The check in at the business class counter was very quick and there is a priority gate for business class passengers for the security check
615,Luke C,4,We visited Vietnam flying by Vietnam Airlines and this was a great start to our holiday. We flew in premium economy so between business and economy meaning we get some.extra leg room which was much appreciated. We were served two fairly large meals on the trip which were very nice.<br><br>Highly recommend this airline.you will not regret it
616,Neil H,4,"Melbourne to Hanoi via Ho Chi Minh - great service, excellent meals and drinks.  Seats 3K great cabin lighting. Dreamliner with 1-2-1 layout, with space for 28 passengers in total.  Used the Qantas lounge in Melbourne prior to departure. Fully-flat beds and direct aisle access at every business class seat."
616,Delta T,5,"The RT flights were on 787 and A350 for US$160. The comfort of these planes really made the difference plus the lunch. The helpful staff also made the trips less stressful. <br>On the return flight from Hanoi with horrendous ride from Hanoi to Noi Bai, I barely had less than an hour to the departure time. I contacted a guiding staff about my situation. She promptly arranged for my immediate checked bag service. I made it to the gate in time. Remember the airline allows one free checked bag up (20kg or other) and a free hand bag. I made a mistake with pre-check bag purchase. Until I realized my mistake, The pre-check bag purchase was non-refundable.<br>If you decide to save a bit of money for the cramping seat (A320), paid checked luggage, paid drink and food, sloppy flight schedule, and the hassle by staff from a budget airliner, then the choice is yours."
616,Ron H,5,Regularly travel with this Airline. very comfortable business class and great service.comforable seats that fold out flat.
616,Antonegea,5,Was not looking forward to this flight but everything from check-in at Siem Reap to onboard experience was excellent. Leg room  and seat width more than generous especially compared to European airlines! On a full flight the  flight attendants were very polite and friendly but above all  professional and efficient. On a flight of 1 hour 45 minutes a cold dinner was efficiently served with beverages including beer and this was appetising and well enjoyed by myself and it seems neighbouring passengers!  A big thank you from  me to all at Vietnam Airlines.   If only British Airways were  half as good!
616,Teresa R,5,"The flight was delayed because of snow; the plane had to be de-iced before we could take off. <br>The flight was fine, being short, I had enough leg room and the bonus of an empty seat next to me. <br>The food was very good, I am vegetarian and know that airlines don't always do well with veggie food. A long flight where I would have liked more offers of hot drinks. I did ask a couple of times and was served quickly."
617,PassMeMyPassport,2,"Food- terrible and I mean absolutely awful. Take sandwiches with you.<br><br>Service - Poor. Do they train their staff to be so surly, unfriendly and miserable? A whole team of cabin crew who look like they hate their jobs.<br><br>Seat- Not too bad but certainly  not comfortable enough for a long haul 11 hour flight.<br><br>AOB- You can’t choose your seat until 24 hours before departure. Bit weird. I chose a window and aisle seat for my travelling companion. VA changed my seats to middle and window. We wanted an aisle for a very good reason to do with health. They changed our seats in the hope of getting more money from us when booking window and aisle<br><br>Cheap airline. Cheap food. Cheap attitude towards customers."
617,abbymorgan,4,Airline good and empty to plenty of space but snack was awful a stale bun and a very strange jello! Plus no beer on board only soft drinks
617,Linda F,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this airline, there is plenty of leg room ans the seats are really comfortable, and service was amazing. The flights I was on were about 1-2 hours in length and definitely better than Jetstar Pacific to which i flew from Hanio to Nha Trang that was painful.<br><br>I only flew domestic, but they are a first rate airline and would recommend using this airline.<br><br>I am considering using them for international travel when I next go to Vietnam."
617,Michael M,5,We (Family) flew from Melbourne to Saigon (Vietnam) business class with a stopover for a few days.  We then flew from Vietnam to Tokyo.   Business class is exceptional service all the way on both legs return. Plenty of leg room and very comfortable. Staff are exceptionally friendly and cater for your needs as required. If you do not fly business class certainly try premium economy and share nearly the same luxury as business class at a cheaper rate. The cost on Vietnam Airlines business compared to other airlines is by far much more economical.  Great experience great flight and highly recommended.
617,Thanh Huynh,2,"Vietnam Airline is ok if you want to fly directly to Vietnam but as for there service is not that great as there always delay and we have to wait awhile. The seat a small, food is ok not the best and they dont have kids food."
618,Camelgirl43,5,Did know what to expect but it was a very nice airline with all the modern amenities and professional cabin crew. If you are in Vietnam and will be flying you don't have to worry about this airline. Some developing countries do not have high-quality airlines but Vietnam does.
618,Diggs,4,"Due to an injury on holiday we had to fly business class back to Canada. The staff and service in the flight was top notch and couldn’t have been better. Flying in the Dreamliner was very comfortable, the service and staff were great and the food was very good.  The only issue we had was whale waiting to board in the business class lounge the staff took another woman in a wheelchair down to the he gate and left my wife and I. After repeatedly talking to the staff and almost missing boarding they came to take us to the plane. Overall a great experience"
618,easylacer,3,"Very cramped in Economy class. Not much room between the seats. Food was not brilliant, I had the vegetarian option which was served well before the non vegetarians.<br>No comfort pack just a headset, blanket and cushion.<br>I was on a tour so had no choice of airline. The smaller planes we travelled on seemed to have more room.<br>I wouldn't fly Vietnam Ailines again given the choice."
618,Judi C,4,"We arrived on a domestic flight and had our luggage transferred through automatically, but the business lounge in domestic was not too classy! On arrival at the international terminal, a 7 minute walk, we had been checked in already, had our boarding passes and went through immigration very swiftly. The lounge was better, although the food was a bit stale and not very inviting. <br>We didn't wait for the boarding call, but went directly to the gate, where there was no business entrance but everyone had to wait in one queue. However, once aboard the aircraft all was forgiven as it was a new Dream Liner which allowed us to sleep ""flat"", great as this was a night flight. The movie selection was poor, but that was immaterial as we were soon asleep. Comfort and service were very good indeed, much better than the Thai Air business class we had flown on our outbound journey."
618,nick b,3,"We flew from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur in economy class and first thing I have to say was the price was cheap so cannot complain too much. <br><br>Flew on a 787 in Ho Chi Minh. Flights were on time and all stewardess were smartly dressed and smily. Width of seat was standard and leg room while not great was adequate. Don’t think they had the same amount of current cinema films as other carriers but there were a few on board. <br><br>A couple of nice touches like after food they give a bottle of water to everyone for the flight. However there were some tight restrictions on drinks served, after 1 gin and tonic were told they had run out. Also normal when asking for a short the small bottles are opened and then served with a can of tonic on here they were half measures given. <br><br>Food was ok, with snacks served when needed - pot noodle sandwiches etc. However there never seemed to be any sandwiches when I asked. <br><br>Overall value for money for what I paid, I would fly with them again but only if prices were similar to what I paid this time."
619,Warby,4,"This flight route as you would expect with Vietnam Airlines is very efficient. Check in, security and boarding in HCM excellent<br><br>Flight delayed 20 minutes on departure and arrival<br><br>Cabin comfortable with helpful staff and plenty of storage space. Larger plane for 0900 flight Business 2/2/2 and Economy 2/4/2<br><br>Arrival excellent as gate next to baggage claim. Bags collected within 10 minutes"
619,kymm32,4,"Only writing this because there are many who seem to take it personally because the Viets have a different understanding of service. We've been going to Vietnam for 20 years and we have been yelled at, ignored and treated indifferently by a variety of Vietnamese people responsible for service. Please don't take it as a personal affront, it is simply the way the Vietnamese are. They do not give the extra effort in service anywhere and I don't know why. Just don't get too upset about it.<br><br>If you travel business class close to Vietnam or intra Vietnam it is fantastic. You are not caught up in huge queues and you get to go in the VIP lines. You get the BC lounges and it costs you not much. Do it."
619,andreas p,1,"We needed a first aid box to cover a wood and when we ask at the gate the girl said we don’t have! I asked what happens when you have a small accident, she said I understand but we don’t have! So expensive ticket for their service!"
619,vason69,4,"After our great stay at Siem Reap we head to Hanoi. The check in experience at the airport was  very good and the staff were very friendly and pleasant . However , noticed some very rude behavior i to other fellow passengers from the ground staff while boarding the flight at Siem Reap and  subsequently in flight from some of the members of the crew .<br><br>The flight to Hanoi was very pleasant  and it would be nice if the crew members and ground staff behave appropriately."
619,screpta,4,"We flew premium economy to Australia via Vietnam.  The planes were all Dreamliners, and it was good, but it wasn’t quite excellent.  Really great seats for long haul, and the service was fair, but the cabin crew were not engaging, and didn’t go that extra in comparison to other Airlines.  I had to ask for extra drinks, even tea and coffee, as you only got one small drink on each run.  Also, plastic and paper cups which is very rare in premium economy.  It just felt lacking somehow"
620,Aqusite,3,"Took Vietnam Airlines round trip on an hour and a half flight between Siem Reap and Luang Prabang. Pros: Airbus 321, not a turboprop; nonstop flights; affordable; pleasant in-flight staff. Cons: pilots are daredevils; don't fly route daily; liquor not served on this route, even to white knuckled fliers; food is unspeakably disgusting, half white bread filled with soggy tuna, wrapped moistly in cling wrap, and aspics of different types, or squid flavored broad beans. Zero in-flight entertainment. I imagine longer flights are better? Gets you from A to B, but you might as well take a poorly catered elevator across the sky."
620,Alana M,4,"Very comfortable, clean aircraft, hospitable staff, food was good, inflight entertainment was good<br>International &amp; Domestic flights were both comfortable."
620,Warby,4,"Very good flight all round<br><br>Check in, lounge and boarding good. Arrival was 20 minutes early<br><br>Food was really good quality (for airline food)<br><br>Seats large and comfortable<br><br>Entertainment system did not have the greatest choice but was okay<br><br>Staff were excellent<br><br>Small gripe is that the whole cabin was a little tired and wine was truly awful"
620,Warby,4,"Arrived on time and bag retrieval was good. Has always been the same with clean cabin and helpful staff<br><br>Staff friendly and helpful, each seat has a TV screen but take your own headphones<br><br>Multiple flights throughout the day.

621,TheWholeTruthES,4,"The price led me to take this flight via Saigon over direct flights. The first leg is on an A321 which actually has dedicated seats for Business Class, I believe I saw 4 rows, could be five on a 2-2 configuration. The seats are very comfortable and have all the expected equipment. The only problem is that if the passenger in front of you reclines the seat, you are not longer able to open or close, or use for that matter your table for anything like eating or working on a laptop. First row seats are, in both flights I took, occupied by Airline personnel who fully recline their seats with no respect for paying passengers and doze off. <br><br>The wait at Ho Chi Min Airport is pleasant. The airport has all the usual shops and restaurants ( Burger King and two bars serving food). The Lounge is also very comfortable and well appointed and staffed. Choice of drinks and food are quite impressive actually. The only thing that you cannot do in the transit area, is buy electronics. This includes plug adapters, and since I had forgotten ( yet again) mine at home, I unsuccessfully tried to find one at the airport shops. Impossible.<br><br>The long leg, from Saigon to Melbourne is on a brand new 787 Dreamliner which IMHO is the best and most comfortable aircraft nowadays. The business class section is 1-2-1 of fairly standard seats, herringbone I believe they are called. It is not a really comfy seat in any airline, but it does give you privacy and allows you to rest. I was extremely impressed by the small cabin of Premium Economy in a 2-3-2 configuration. The seats look really good and comfortable. They are not the shelled ones like say Air France or Aeroflot, but they certainly look better than other products in other airlines. <br><br>All in all I was very impressed with the level of service and hard product on Vietnam Airlines. The only real complaint is that embarkation and disembarkation both at Hong Kong and Saigon were always by bus. In Hong Kong this invariably means overcrowded buses for everyone. In Saigon, there is for disembarking a dedicated bus for Business Class Passengers."
621,Hyun J,4,"Sydney to Incheon return via Hanoi. Boeing 787 was pretty well maintained. My family engaged in a conversation with one of the Flight Attendants. Boarding was fairly quick but HAN to SYD had some issues. Staff on SYD-HAN seemed a little boring and smiles were rare. Food was disgusting except for my ICN-HAN flight. My seat was pretty comfortable but the legroom is smaller than expected. No WiFi on the A350 and B787 were a huge disappointment but IFE was pretty great. Compared to their previous product 5 years ago, an immense improvement has been implemented. Around $750AUD for the 4 flights was an amazing price."
621,KiranAppana,3,"Flight seating is comfortable however there is no in flight entertainment, Indian Veg offered (AVML) is substandard. No snacks or Finger food offered. Overall there is a plenty of scope to improve."
621,Adam C,4,"Being 6’4” I’m usually uncomfortable on flights, but the seats on Vietnam Airlines had plenty of room. We had a 12 hour flight and I was fine.<br><br>There was a good selection of movies on the IFE and the food was good, although they did run out of our first choice (the second choice was still good).<br><br>The staff were friendly and the little snacks offered throughout the flight were pretty good. Noodles or sandwiches."
621,Robert K,5,"This flight was a great flight for me.  Friendly staff, great drinks, and some movies.  Quite a good selection to choose from (for some reason I always cry on the movies I watch while flying)."
622,Jennifer L,4,"I flew from YVR to TPE back in September. It was a red eye flight. Boarding was easy, leg room was good, food was good, flight attendants were very accommodating. I’m a tall lady, at nearly 6’. I had neck surgery last year so space is always good for me so I can stretch. I got stuck in a middle seat and was very uncomfortable. I asked the stewardess (POLITELY) if it was possible for me to move to an aisle seat or something with a bit more room.they were so accommodating and moved me to the front of economy where I had plenty of room to stretch my legs or lay comfortably so my neck didn’t stiffen. I slept for the majority of my 12hr flight, it was wonderful!! The only odd thing, which is probably normal, was the fact they started serving breakfast after we took off...all I wanted to do at 1330 in the morning was sleep!!"
622,glen077,2,Flew out from London in Premium Economy and while the seats were very comfortable the service was at best frosty.<br><br>They failed to deliver our vegetarian meals and rather than offer an alternative were very confrontational - asking for proof of ordering the meals originally. This had been reconfirmed the day before when checking in.<br><br>Considering this is the national carrier it could not be any less representative of the wonderful Vietnamese people we encountered in our two and a half week trip.<br><br>The service was much better on our return leg from Hanoi to London - though they have a lot to learn from other carriers.
622,Peggy Y,3,"I flew on Vietnam Airlines 4 times: back and forth from Taipei (international flight) and then 2 domestic flights from Hanoi to Da Nang and then to Saigon. The domestic flights surpassed the international flights by FAR, surprisingly. I am wondering if it was just the pilot and airplane that we were on for the international flights to Taipei (Australian guy), but there was something very wrong with the temperature control on the airplane. My worst nightmare is being trapped on an overheated plane, which is what both flights felt like. The air would be working when we boarded the plane, but then for some reason it would be turned off mid-flight, and then turned back on during landing. Perhaps to save energy? Needless to say, people (including myself) repeatedly tried to adjust the overhead fans in hopes to generate more air to no avail. Interestingly, when I went to the bathroom in the back of the plane where the flight attendants also hang out, that area was nice and cold. Water bottles were not given like on the domestic flights and instead you had to ask for a small plastic cup in which they would fill halfway with lukewarm water. <br><br>The domestic flights, on the other hand, were comfortable and amazing. Great ambiance and second you board the plane. Cold water bottles are given and both flights I took were smooth. <br><br>Both types of flights did not have entertainment."
622,VHKF,5,"Very nice experience flying with Vietnam Airlines on a A380 with seating on a 3-4-3 configuration from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi (Return flights). Planes that they used were comfortable with generous leg space and not cramped at all. Service was normal and the funny thing about the air stewardess were that whenever you said thank you to them, they will always say ""OK"" and not ""welcomed"". Found that a bit peculiar but probably due to insufficient English knowledge. Anyway, good experience and very comfortable seating. By the way even for domestic flights, especially on the Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi sector, please ensure that you are at the airport at least 3 hours before your flight as the queue at the customs check is horrendous! I waited for 1 hour 45 minutes for to get through customs as they don't open enough customs check points for travelers and they work sloooooow! You need to take off everything: belts, wallets shoes, hats, etc to go through the detectors."
622,Sylvaine M,3,"While the service in flight was absolutely fine, the check in proved to be quite a costly ordeal as the attendant in service that day was eager to get every single penny she could milk out of all of the tourists on excess weight. Even our carry ons were scrutinized. Whether you were gold or platinum on fidelity programs was of no interest to her either. Bitter after taste but the flight was fine."
623,Rishivi,4,"We travelled from Paris to Hanoi in November, returning in December on Vietnam Airlines. This is the first time we have used this airlines and were impressed with the planes, seating and service. I also have to say that the tickets cost about 30% less than any European airline flying to Hanoi. Prior to getting on the airplane we visited the Air France lounge at CDG (terminal 2E) and I have to say the wine selection was awesome. Vietnam Airlines flies the Airbus 350 on this route and in Business has a 1-2-1 configuration. The seats recline fully to become a flat bed but for tall people might prove a little small. The A350's are pretty new and the cabin was spotless. There was a big wide screen that rotates around one hinge allowing you to position the screen as desired. This was great. The movie selection though is poor with a lot of old films. <br>The service on the flight was great with the crew coming around often to offer beverages.<br>Great experience."
623,robertmH1838UF,5,"Wonderful flight with exceptional service. Great plane with room to move, nice meal service with quality food."
623,Gary F,3,"Cabin staff were all very young. I guess on these short flights internal around Vietnam, not a lot is needed to be done. No food or drink service in a lot of these internal flights, due to flying time and distance."
623,Spud800,4,"We are incredibly impressed by the ground crew for the airline a Heathrow Airport the supervisor for the flight spotted a problem that we might have,changed our seats so it would be eased even though we had not mentioned a thing ,this was not going the extra mile but way beyond she is a complete credit to the airline and I thank her for saving us a bad time on a twelve hour flight."
623,Claire,5,"I was seated in Premium Economy from Sydney to London and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. I had much more leg room that I would've in economy, the check in was slightly delayed but I had sky-priority so I boarded first. The flight staff were lovely and made sure I was comfortable the entire flight. And all of this for only $1200! Amazing. Can't wait to fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
624,Frank R,4,"Nothing to say, if you fly with vietnam airlines you don t get extras for the baggage,  that s a huge plus compared to jetstar or vietjet."
624,rod g,5,Thoroughly enjoyed flying with VA. New planes but fantastic cabin crew. It helped we flew business. <br>The plane was very clean. Toilets large by comparison to other business classes and I could not fault the staff. <br>Very polite and helpful. <br>Would not hesitate to fly with them again.
624,Optionalextras2,4,"Went business as at the time of booking there was only about $10 difference in the price.  Check in was a breeze, we started to go through security but staff saw our tickets and put us through the premium lane, we didn’t even see that (far right).  The lounge was ok, plenty there to eat and relaxing areas, good runway view. <br>Boarding, we all caught the same bus right across active runways way back of the domestic area and all boarded together. That’s ok.  Newspapers offered and drinks.  No food. Just a short flight, uneventful and was quite happy with it all. Bags were out soon after going through immigration.  All good."
624,Jean Y,3,"Travelled Premium Economy from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City and then on to Da Nang and return.   Flight was on time - Plane and seats were spotless.  Seats also comfortable with good leg room (I am 188cm).   Food and drink was ""Economy Class"" with plastic cutlery and had to ask for a second drink, so felt that extra cost was only for extra leg room."
624,turista_Al,5,"we flew on January 1, the plane was empty, the cabin staff allowed to move to economy premium. very good seats, nice service, new plane, big surprise. would be happy to fly again with vietnam airlines"
625,gregp362017,4,"This airline keeps improving, newer aircraft and staff training are clearly reaping dividends. Food is not bad and wine is available even on short trips."
625,lazypigcess,3,"(DELAY) Flight was delayed from SIN-HAN (30+min). While HAN-SIN, an email informed that the flight was delayed 30min and then, at the airport, the boarding gate was further delayed by 30min. (FOOD) I tried the Pork with rice and Fish with rice, they are good. (SERVICE) SIN-HAN was good and the staff were very well prepared, generous and timely. However the flight HAN-SIN, the staff seems flustered and always in a rush, mixed up drink order. Less professional I felt. (Entertainment) A shared video screen broadcasting videos similar to ""Just for Laugh"". <br><br>To be fair, since i paid the fare similar of a budget airlines. To compare their service standard to budget airline, the in-flight services offer (food&amp;drinks, check in bag allowance and etc) is definitely better than most of the budget airlines."
625,kefehu,2,"If you want rude personnnel, wait 1 hour at the baggage belt, and miss your connection, this is the Airline for you. Also you need to check in again if you have to change flights."
625,Raaj1976,2,Customer Service is not responsive on phones but emails work well. Twice we got wrong choice of food delivered.
625,Plamen T,2,"Been traveling for a few years in Asia and Vietnam is the least likable place, but this is story for another day. Back on Vietnam airlines...not happy with them at all. They will not check your stuff to the final destination if you have connection flight. We travel from Siem Reap to Phu Quoc via Hochi Min and we needed to check out and check in again at different terminal. The que for the visas was kilometre long and we have to pay again, even that we have payed over the internet. I have to give 20$ bribe to guy from border agents to get us true, because of the long que we were about to miss our connection flight. If you ever have to change flight in Vietnam make sure you have more time in between. Not a pleasant experience!"
626,cherriesfan_9,5,"On time, very comfortable, and particularly well looked after. 3 choices of main meal (but having enjoyed ourselves in the Lotus lounge) we did not need it.<br>Ample room (in Business class) even for a 6 foot plus male. Would definitely use again especially on longhaul. Excellent cabin crew"
626,GrahamInnes78,2,"Overall the actual flight was quite good, for this means lots of leg room as i'm 6'4"".<br><br>2 x Negative things here however there is no lounge access to the Lotus Lounge in Hanoi even being a platinum elite plus sky team member - reason given was because the flight was domestic!?!?. Quite disappointed as i was looking for a beer and a sandwich. Secondly no air miles either. Had i known previously i would have flown with Vietjet who were much cheaper."
626,TheUglyDog,5,"Comfortable seats, more than enough leg room for me, over 6', nice lunch and on time departure and arrival. Our flight crew was friendly and attentive. A very pleasant flight."
626,Guzheng_KL,4,I took Vietnam airlines this time due to cost and connection time. Result was more than I expected. Plus Air cabin was very new and clean then food was improved a lot.<br>Crew was young and more than average. I prefer to travel VE again.
626,Drifter,4,"Vietnam Airlines is a very good, and efficient Airlines.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  International flights they serve a basic sandwich and fruit with a small salad.  Basic soft drinks OJ and Soda and water.  Planes are clean everything runs very efficiently.  They also seat back of the plane first which I believe is a great idea."
627,bon1979,4,"My wife and I flew with this airline on 1st September. Friendly staff, good food, comfortable seats, good entertainment and cheap compared to other airlines at the time.<br>We had to get off at Ho Chi Minh to get on another flight with airline to Hanoi. Did't like having to collect checked In bag and then having to take it to another part of airport for it to be placed on next plane."
627,denjo_13,3,"Same as most other airlines. My flight was at 12.25am, so was travelling through the night. I had previously set out from my Singapore hotel at approx 5pm so I was pretty tired by now. I did press my buzzer about 3 individual times for an attendant to get me a drink, but no body came, so in the end got up myself and walked to the galley where the attendants were sitting eating and chatting away."
627,lanhamumc,5,"Pleasant flight, comfortable, roomy seats, ok food, attentive service.  On time service.  Have used Vietnam Airlines and will do so again."
627,Michael Margolin Travel Associates Coy,3,"The cabin crew were not friendly doing just a 'job' with minimum effort. The positives are that the seats are more comfortable and with more room and at least you check-in at the Business Class area (avoiding the long economy class queues). I can't say that the food or wine selection is better as it appears to be the same as offered in economy.<br>So is it worth paying more ? Yes, I think so, especially when one considers that Business Class is double the price !"
627,Mick F,5,"We flew from Sydney to Hanoi , two domestic flights and back from Ho Chi Minh city to Sydney. I found all flights really good, modern aircraft with great service from the flight crew.  We flew to and  back on the 787 and it seemed to have slightly more leg room than a 777. Very welcome for a tall family. On board movies and tv not quite as extensive as some others but still found plenty to watch and of course lots to choose from in Vietnamse. Full service with meals and drinks and 30 kilos for international booked luggage."
628,CatalinaPetre,5,"We actually were in Premium Economy. We chose this company with no previous knowledge of them and I have to say we were very impressed with the quality of the flight. As soon as we arrived on the plane we were offered drinks and warm wet towels that smelled like jasmine - very nice touch. The flight attendants were polite and helpful at all times, always ready to help. The food was of good quality, there were plenty of drinks available and the entertainment provided was good. I would fly with them again/"
628,Darinullah,4,This is my second time to fly with Vietnam airline. The ticket price is not high if you book in advance about 5 months. Food was ok but the return flight from Nagoya-Ho Chi Minh we got Unagi Kabayaki which is famous food in Nagoya. Food from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh and Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok was so so. No choice to choose. <br><br>The service was ok . No entertain facilities on board.
628,Jamie22012016,4,"First time on VN and it is now on my list of airlines to take! Comfortable leg room, food is good, toilets are clean and the airline staff helpful and polite. The only minus point for me is the entertainment but that is really minor because it has a good mix of latest movies, classics and their own Vietnamese films too which is a wonderful addition. I enjoyed watching them! If you have a overnight layover, which I had, and hold a Singapore passport, you don't need to pay for a visa upon re-entering. Best part, they can arrange to take your luggage all the way to the next destination. Arrived intact and in good condition too!"
628,Léa D,4,"I recently flew from London to Hanoi and thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Vietnam Airlines. It was my first time flying in a Dreamliner and you really can feel the difference! The seats were comfortable, the air quality really made my long journey go by very quickly. The movie selection is also very good, with lots of international films and high definition screens. The food was better than most airlines I have flown with. Only drawback was the price but I was flying over the Christmas period."
628,Punna92,3,Small and old Airbus 321 was used with only 4 business recliner seats. Food was delicious and flight attendants were good and attentive. The new Miracle Lounge at BKK airport near Gate 6 was much better than the smaller ones.
629,Punna92,5,"VN used new Boeing 787 Dreamliner from HAN to NRT on a red-eye flight. Seat configuration 1-2-1 , so everyone got privacy and easy access. Seat laid flat nicely.Limited selection of movies but found some good ones. Food nicely prepared with good service from flight attendants. Lotus lounge in Hanoi was spacious with Pho noodles, fruits etc."
629,jrsee,4,"This was my first flight on the Airbus A350.<br>Loved the A350. The lounge in Hanoi is really good. View of the airfield operations was outstanding. <br>The food in the lounge was good, although there were some items available it seems for additional cost. Not sure why.<br> Getting to the plane from departure gate seemed odd. Looks like the plane was not parked at the 'right' right gate so we walked between gates jetbridge connection.<br>• Food on flight good. Good service on board.<br>• Left late made up some of the time."
629,rmcgregor2016,4,"We did a return flight from Melbourne with an extra to Siam Reap.  Overall, there was nothing to complain about.  The flight left and arrived on time and generally the service was good."
629,spanner48,4,"The flights within Vietnam are so-so: reasonably well-run, but no better.  But they make a real effort on their London route, which they say is their most prestigious one.<br><br>•   Brand new B787s<br>•   Plenty of knee-room: I'm 6'2"" / 1.88m, and I had 4""/100mm spare<br>•   Good, attentive service<br>•   Good food, with a choice at each meal of western or Vietnamese cuisine."
629,Iva Z,5,"I have used domestic flights from Vietnam airlines multiple times and must say that they have never disappointed! All flights were on time, staff was nice and helpful, very organized. The plane was always clean, magazine was as good as new and complimentary water and wet towel was a part of the flight. <br>It is great value for money, can only recommend to fellow travellers!"
630,Polly E,4,"We have flown 4 times on this airline; Bangkok to Hanoi, Hanoi to Hue, Da Nang to Nha Trang and Nha Trang to Ho Chi Min City. 3 flights left within a few minutes of the actual time, one had a 20 minute delay. Complimentary water and cool wipes were provided. Luggage arrived promptly after we arrived at baggage reclaim. It was as easy as getting on and off a bus. Staff were friendly and helpful. We could actually hear what the Captain had to say-this is not always possible on a lot of flights."
630,Taryn G,5,Vietnam airlines provided extremely good on time service. I flew with them for both domestic and international flights. There were short delays at times but the staff do their best to help out. <br><br>I would fly with them again.
630,Alex S,1,"I made all reservations online for my trips in Vietnam during my upcoming business trip, as instructed by my organization.<br><br>Guess what... I already received a third notification of changes! <br>According to the last one, I won't be able to make my connecting flight to Japan on my way back to North America. <br>I have contacted the local representative in Canada... I took me two hours though to figure out the correct phone number since the one the airline lists is out of service.<br>The representative politely explained to me that nothing can be done to change my ticket simply because, the flight I had booked DOES NOT EXIST!!! When I discussed the possibility to leave me with my original booking for another flight, that had been changed as well, I got a very kind offer to add some $$ to change it to the original! <br><br>I never heard anything like this! I understand that something like this can happend but rather as an exeption. My boss already prohibited any business trips to Vietnam from the organization I work for (13,500 people) for exception we commute to/in/from by reputable and reliable transporter.<br><br>So... if you want to be on time... stay away from Vietnam Airlines<br><br>To be fair, I used them a lot before and it was a decent company with relatively good service."
630,Bold-Erdene,3,"It was domestic flight. <br>When Mongolian Citizen traveling, our Passport extension page is separated. I mean, if the front page valid time expired we extend the next page. It was not understandable to the counter officer, and he didn't speak well in English. <br>But stayed there about 5 minutes rest of them was fine.<br>Seemed landing and takeoff was good."
630,Jose2050,3,"Lucky to ride in one of their newest planes, which was very comfortable. However, though there were screens in the back of seats and plenty to watch, no earphones issued or available.<br>Even the food on this flight was a little better than normal."
631,Viv B,3,"Dreamliner aircraft were new and streamlined. No footrest let alone swivel footrest to prevent ankle swelling.<br>Flight staff ignored call buttons for assistance, not as caring and friendly as other Asian Airlines.<br>Food was edible though not remarkable."
631,Dad181,4,"Just flew Vietnam Airlines on a Dreamliner. This is a good airline, helpful ground staff, quality aircraft. Food and service is ok although sometimes hard to find an attendant if you require something. I would fly again without hesitation."
631,Stewart,4,Travelled dec 24 thinking we had purchased two tickets. Upon arrival at checkin told we booked the flight but not confirmed.  Ticket price went from 180 to 250cdn. Vietnam airlines holds the rights on flights to Nha trang so fees are much higher as compared to Viet air etc where costs are about 30-40 can.  Flight and service was very good for short flight.  Water served only. Seats comfortable
631,AndyPG,5,"Managed to get 4 legs with Vietnam airways business class for under £500. Excellent value. Lounges are good, service and food on the flights good. Definitely will fly again on short legs around Vietnam."
631,Gidons51,5,Flight was very good . New plane . Service was efficient though not as friendly as in other Asian airlines. Food was ok . Flight on schedule.
632,stevena968,4,"Though not the most up to date aircraft and boarding is mostly done via bus-to-plane, the quality of service on both legs of this reservation was excellent.  The staff was beyond courteous and went out of their way to tend to passengers needs.  Even with a 2-hour flight, a towel, full meal, and beverage service were provided.  I would fly this airline again in a heartbeat.  The leg to Pho Quoc, however, was flown on Jet Star and I would never fly this line again (no customer service and very difficult connections in Ho Chi Minh City)."
632,Quang Kiet Le,4,"Flight was departed on time and arrived HAN roughly one hour before scheduled time. Cabin crew was good though two flight attendants were a bit rude. I was seating on the first row of Economy cabin with extra legroom and two big windows. The Airbus A350-900 was really great, and I enjoyed it so much though the in-flight meal was a bit boring to me."
632,cornwallNorfolk,4,Second time we have flown with this airline.  Good value for money. Flight on time. As always on a 12 hour flight the seats could do with more padding
632,Trang L,3,"definitely not a 4 star airline , only score a minus one star . did not allow check in all the way to Da Nang . The transfer did not get priority even though we are travelling in business class . The Lounges in Singapore and Saigon were . both horrible - no comforatble seat , rubbish everywhere . The local passengers were even worse . They pushed &amp; elbowed you so that they disembarked first - need to have some manner lessons . There is no ""excuse me "" or "" sorry"" in the Vietnamese vocabulary"
632,BaggieStephen,5,"Enjoyed 7 Vietnam Airline flights in 3 weeks from London to Saigon etc with return from Hanoi.<br>Very good service, representing excellent value in a package deal with Fleetway Travel.<br>Most flights on time with two main flights on amazing Dreamliners!"
633,Chonee,5,"We had various flights booked with Vietnam Airlines during our trip (HCMC - Da Nang, Da Nang - Hanoi &amp; Hanoi - Taipei) and we were happy with all 3.  The flights were extremely inexpensive (comparing them to similar flights I've done in the US) and they were never delayed and the service from the flight attendants was good.  The food was OK but the flights were short so didn't bother us."
633,DouglasBaxter51,4,"Very easy book in at Heathrow, comfortable Dreamliner with good legroom. Although a long flight ( some 12 hours ) felt quite good upon landing. Staff were very attentive and friendly. I would have no qualms in using Vietnam  Airlines again."
633,juksingjaisg,2,"As a follow up to my previous post:<br><br>Thanks so much for giving me a reason to NOT book with Vietnam Airlines in the future! <br><br>I've never encountered such lack of goodwill from an airline for making a change so last minute, 3 days before departure, with no alternative flights, until Vietnam Airlines. Thanks for the lack of assurance to your customers on future flights with your airline, and I'm sure you'll be making a lot more money selling the seats I had no choice but to cancel, at a higher price on this peak period. Congratulations on making higher profits at the expense of your customers!<br><br>The image is the response I got from your telesales"
633,juksingjaisg,2,"Horrible airline that mistreats its paying customers! I originally booked a two-leg flight from Singapore to Danang, with a 2-hour connection in Ho Chi Minh City. 4 days before my flight to Danang, the Ho Chi Minh City to Danang flight timing is changed 1.5 hours earlier, resulting in a 30 min connection in HCMC which is not enough time for an international to domestic connection. Never mind the last minute surprise, I also had to find an alternative flying time. When I tried to contact them the same day to make a change, there was no response! Then within a day's time, all alternative flights were sold out, leaving me with ZERO options to fly via Vietnam Airlines! I ended up having to book a DIFFERENT airline at 50% ABOVE the original cost i paid for Vietnam Airlines, on a budget airline, to make my journey, because it was so last minute.<br><br>Thanks so much for this terrible and unnecessarily expensive experience, Vietnam Airlines!"
633,Les M,1,"I didn't even recognize the dreamliner; The cabin crew was rude .  Food was inedible. The wine was garbage and we were two hours late so we missed our connecting flight.  As far as I am concerned, all the planes should be grounded and the pilots sent out to pasture.  I have nothing good to say about the airline."
634,Markcviet,3,"Vietnam Airlines is using large planes like the Dreamliner on flights between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. This helped to make my recent return trip to Hanoi a comfortable experience. Unfortunately Vietnam Airlines chooses to dock the aircraft out on the tarmac so that a bus ride to and from the terminal building is required. The lunchtime flight to Hanoi included a standard hot meal, while on the mid-afternoon return flight a rather unappetising snack (a bead roll with ham) was available, and a chocie between water and coca-cola. Movies and other programs were available on demand. Both flights departed on time. Compared to the other (budget) airlines which fly this route, Vietnam Airlines is a good option."
634,XPLORING,4,"Flew on the A381 between Hanoi and Siem Reap. Short flight so had no personal entertainment available to us. Our experience was pleasant from checking in ,boarding and until getting off the aircraft. The plane was clean . Staff were friendly , neat and helpful. The food service was efficient . Can’t rate the meal served as I did not have the meal onboard ."
634,XavierBB,4,"It was my first flight with Vietnam Airlines. The service, the airplane and the crew were fantastic. In fact, I took 2 flights more with them."
634,michaelcraighead,3,Two international flights and two internal flights. Both international flights over an hour late. One internal fligt also delayed an hour. Same excuse for all due to the late arrival of the plane but plane observed on Tarmac three and half hours before flight.<br>Not buying this excuse particularly when it was a recurring theme.<br>Meals were cold and entertainment package lacking for return flight as insufficient options.<br>A small cup with two mouthfuls of water is insufficient for a Seven hour flight. 600 ml bottle a minimum.
634,Jesse F,4,"We were in Vietnam on holidays and looked at webjet for our flight between Hanoi and Danang. There were plenty of other budget carriers who were half the price, but after a friend's recommendation, we chose to pay the extra and fly with the national airline. <br><br>Overall I am thankful we made this decision. All crew were professional, the plane was very clean and all the safety messages were read out in a few different languages. Yes we were 10 minutes late to board, and 15 minutes late to leave, but we were on holiday so we didn't really care. <br><br>All in all a good experience. The main thing was, I felt as safe as I would on either Virgin or Qantas in Australia."
635,micktaylor2016,1,"Again a very poor flight. No sense of urgency to depart on time. Boarding commenced at scheduled departure time. Return to gate after taxi commenced for technical issue which I have no issue with at all. Passengers of various Asian ethnicity around us with no seat belts on during taxi, takeoff and landing. No cabin service again. Again a long wait to exit aircraft down the stairs. This airline is a shocker, they have no regard for passenger service or inflight safety. Unfortunately another 2 flights to go before we get home and never fly this airline again. Give me QANTAS any day."
635,wdchuck1,3,"Wanted to try the much-touted 350 business class on my short internal trip as i was considering doing long-hauls on it in the future..<br><br>unfortunately it was not up to expectations.<br><br>The use the configuration with the staggered seating so when you are sleeping, your feet go in a compartment ""under"" the seat in front of you.  it's fine if you are a great sleeper but if you move a lot, it's restrictive<br><br>nothing close to the seats on CX, SQ or AA<br><br>Shoulder room on the seat is basically horrible- very little of it<br><br>VOD choices are limited - about 30 movies but limited video programs - tough for a long flight<br><br>can;t comment on food as only a snack was served (open sandwich) and a single red and white wine (marginal chilean brands)<br><br>Oh well....."
635,Farizan25,2,Nothing much to offer Airbus 321 has been good anyways. No inflight entertainment. Blanket was not in an enclosed plastic bag so thought it is reuse immediately after previous flight. Halal was served on board though. Nice and friendly staff welcomes you with a smile.
635,ricmitch,4,"We fly to Vietnam once a year to visit our daughter and son in-law. We prefer a direct flight and use this airline as it is several hundred dollars cheaper than Qantas which code shares with them. We have travelled business, premium economy and economy. The last trip in November we travelled premium economy and although the cabin area was spacious we were disappointed to be served our meals the same as economy class using plastic utensils etc. As they have new aircraft for Aust./Vietnam flights now we consider they could improve their meal service and hope they do.  We are generally  happy with this airline."
635,WanderingTaxman,5,"After disembarking in Hanoi, I realized I left my iPhone on the plane. I ran back to the gate  but the plane had already been moved. Prior to going through passport control I stopped at the airline’s desk and reported my loss. <br><br>The helpful lady there told me to go to the list and found desk on the other side of customs. I did and they took my info. After a nervous 30 minute wait, they delivered my phone to me!  They sent an employee out to the aircraft and retrieved the phone. <br><br>This was the start of our trip and not having my phone would have been a real drag as I took over 2,000 photos with it. <br><br>Thanks Vietnam Airlines!"
636,Marcus_G_Apicius,4,"Decided to give them a go after noticing both legs would be on 787s and A350s. On long haul I find the higher humidity and lower noise levels to be quite desirable. Upgrades to Y+ were relatively cheap so I grabbed that as well.<br><br>The cabin was in a bad state. There is no way around it. For aircrafts this new it's a crying shame. The seat I originally sat on reclined when you sat on it - the spring had worn, or something, and so I spent my time trying not to lean back until we took off and I could move to another seat. The arm rest was cracked and the tray cover sank into it. The belt was starting to fray on the edges. Did they import this seat from a retired 747?<br><br>On the upside, Y+ on the 787 is 2-3-2 which is fantastic with great pitch. And to be honest, I care about this more than I care about meals or broken tray tables on bulkhead seats. The A350 Y+ is identical to Y (3-3-3) except for a bit more legroom. <br><br>The meals were lukewarm twice, but the food was decent, much better than Scoot (usually my first leg to SIN before a switch to a legacy airline to Europe). <br><br>As for service, they're Vietnamese, so don't expect the gentle smiles of SQ, but what you need will get done, quickly. <br><br>The return flight from CDG was an AF codeshare on the tightly packed 3-4-3 77W. It's OK so long as you are ahead of or on the wing as the 777s are very loud compared to newer aircraft. AF food is great, perhaps the best in Y but I might be biased as a French citizen. On the other hand you will have to endure Air France and CDG's latest experiments in slowing the flow of passengers towards their aircraft (I counted 3 queues before my luggage left, and another 5 before I stepped into the aircraft - maybe time for a review of the national shame that is CDG).<br><br>Given the legroom and seat width, and newer aircrafts (even with run down cabins), I think this is a decent budget option for long haul EU-APAC."
636,Carl N,4,"We flew on an A321 a bigger aircraft than I expected going between Singapore and Vietnam, considering we flew from Perth Western Australia to Singapore on a Boeing 737/800.  The aircraft had plenty of leg room, I expected less be an Asian airline.  The food was very nice and you had a choice of meals.  Considering it was a short flight, only 1h40m the food and drinks were served and cleaned up with plenty of time to eat.<br><br>Overall a very comfortable flight"
636,shahrul79,4,"I have traveled using Vietnam Airlines previously and was quite unhappy with the service. However, this time i wanted to try it again and was pleasantly surprised with the improvements. I visited their sales office for some changes in my ticket and was greeted very courteously and received a very fast and efficient service. check-in was very fast and good at the airport as well. It was a comfortable flight all the way to my destination. Flight attendances were very nice and friendly. Have been promoting to friends and family to try this airline ever since. Good job Vietnam Airlines."
636,Julia S,4,"Good check -in, waiting area pleasant, seats on board had good space.  Bottled water offered in flight.  Fly time 1:20 passed quickly."
636,AndrewMm9,5,"I know it was only a 40 min flight but the added expense was well worth it from our treck from Melbourne. As we boarded from the tarmac we were directed to the business class bus, a super spacious vehicle with fantastic aircon and very comfortable seats. A great place to be waiting for your fellow passengers to arrive. When we arrived at the plane there were enough staff to help my 77 year mother up the steps and her carry on. Upon our arrival in Phu Quoc I felt like a movie star, two small mini buses with leather seats were waiting with the air con on to whisk us to the terminal before the economy class passengers even made it to the aircraft door. I have no idea how but our checked bags were coming out before the rest of the passengers even made it to the terminal. Well done Vietnam Airlines for delivering a level of service well above my expectation even for such a short flight."
637,PedroJapan,4,"The check-in and gate services are a mess, and these are contract services staff at Chubu, no Vietnam Airlines staff members. On board the service is excellent, warm, friendly and the meals are pretty tasty for short haul flights. The connection time is just about right at Hanoi."
637,Ian S,5,First time on Vietnam Airlines. In Premium Economy actually. Was a bit dubious due to the low fare in Premium. Not sure how it would stack up to Qantas or Japan Airlines. But very pleasantly surprised! Perfect flight schedule. From start to finish top professional service on NEW Boeing Dreamliner 787. Great seat with vast leg room.  Excellent screen and entertainment. Great meals with generous servings. Quiet and comfortable. Impressed. Would definitely book on Vietnam Airlines again.
637,Miriam C,4,The ground and air staff were all pleasant. We had a full meal that I enjoyed. The plane was clean and I was able to relax on board.
637,James C,5,"The best PE seats, service and experience ever.  As a very frequent traveller using Business class as a norm, short trips like 7 to 8 hours this is great."
637,enchanted-tale08,4,"Definitely up to expectations for the price i pay for. There were no bed service but the seat was comfy and blanke, pillow, slippers and vanity kit were provided but it might be too narrow and cramped for people with larger build. I wouldn't say that the food is amazing, because i definitely had better ones from other airlines (in economy class) but i do love the garlic bread that they offer (even though the standard varies) than just artisan bread. There was no wifi on board the long hual flight but the the seat was so comfy that i slept through majority of the flight (yes you can lie flat, entirely flat). Service was great and on par with other 5 star airlines, amazing. The crew were polite and attentive, everything on point. <br><br>I was hungry in the middle of the night for my return flight and requested for some snacks. They offered me sandwiches and 2 types of instant noodles. I didn't really quite understood what flavours was there for the instant noodle, and the crew actually took the trouble to walk to the back of the cabin to get the 2 types of instant noodles, walk to the front of the cabin to get a serving tray to present it nicely and back to my seat again (seated at seat 3K). <br><br>Stopover was at Ho Chih Minh, and the lounge was great too. Wide variety of food, tasted not bad. <br><br>Wouldn't mind flying with them again (:"
638,micktaylor2016,1,"Premium Economy seat had broken recline Lever. Asked the clueless cabin crew and got told it was broken,!!!. Anyway took 3 hours for my wife to fix it with various cutlery items and a headset lead. Cabin service non existent, crew rarely seen. After arrival of the meal trays the crew are not seen again for an hour or so, leaving the meal tray to sit in front of you the whole time. Discussed placing the meal tray on the floor in the isle or placing in the overhead locker just to get the damn thing out of my face. Seat belt sign remained for most of the flight even when perfectly smooth, suspect it was a ploy by the crew to keep everyone seated they could do even less work.  On arrival at gate after shutdown no APU or external power connected, aircraft completely powerless and big delay getting stairs, cabin hot as hell. Overall a joke of an operation, unfortunately booked on them to return home but never fly Vietnam airlines again."
638,padidar68,4,"Nice big and new airplane. <br>Friendly crew, nice landing and no turbulence. <br>Great legroom. <br>Great food and drink too."
638,Tender A,5,"fastest and cheapest flight to Vietnam from Japan. Its direct and only takes 4-5 hours. service is good and the flight is pleasant . The food is meh but , well , its airplane food .lots of inflight movies"
638,JEKOnthego,4,"This was a short commuter flight to get from Point A to B. Refreshments were served but in-flight entertainment didn't really exist. Short pre-chosen films that you could watch, but not listen to.  Adequate for the trip."
638,Gerrard1444,3,Each of our five internal flights were late. They don’t use air bridges so you get jammed into a bus and left sweltering in the bus for 10-16. The flight crew are really nice and the airline checkin are helpful
639,drhr2016,4,"we took economy plus , wide seats and reasonably comfortable seating and leg space, only cannot lie flat but better than economy. Meals were good and tasty and very good service from the stewards. They do look after you well and trying to help.<br><br>I will definitely recommend and I will use this airlines again if I travel again to Vietnam/Cambodia."
639,Zuckerschlosser,1,"Never experienced such an unfriendly check in in my life, i paid for business class and there was no service whatsoever.Got a coupon for their lounge but that is a noisy place and i didn't felt welcome there neither. Service quality at its lowest.<br>The check in not different neither, business class seat was wide enough but old and looked very used with chipped part on the seat.<br>The flight attendant tried his best but the food was horrible, still not sure what it was ?<br>No real in flight entertainment, a two hour flight !<br>Flew back with economy and their service is much lower, smiling faces not available, warm welcome, not here beside the cramped seats.<br>unfortunately not much choice to fly in vietnam, i signed up for a membership before ( already two month ago, never received a card."
639,Stephen S,4,"I recently travelled to and from Vietnam with Vietnam airlines. I found the trip comfortable particularly as I had an exit seat with plenty of leg room. The planes are modern, the Dreamliner, the staff courteous and service and food of good quality. Worth considering as international airline"
639,unifiedone,4,"Eventhough VIetnam Airline is not as big as Thai,SIA or Malaysian but the level of service provided is quite good.Very efficient Call Centre and Ground Service.I think with new planes coming they will prosper to even a grester high."
639,dannephi,5,"Planes were spotless, crew was friendly, and the whole experience was overwhelmingly positive.  I would fly with Vietnam at any future opportunity.  They are also a SkyTeam partner."
640,Adam F,4,"People seem to have preconceptions about ""developing world"" airlines when the reality is that often these airlines have the best investment and a real desire to improve. <br><br>Vietnam Airlines is one of these national carriers that have seen significant upgrades to their long haul fleet in recent years, and now boasts a stable of 787s and A350s. On the 787, their business class is in a 1-2-1 configuration, with aisle access for every passenger and a reverse herringbone seat similar to that on Cathay Pacific. <br><br>The seat is comfortable, with plenty of legroom, a large TV screen and a very comfortable fully flat bed. Food can be hit and miss compared to the bigger airlines but quality is always above average. Crew are super-friendly and helpful. The only letdown is from the IFE, with very few decent films to watch. Luckily that's not an issue for me as sleeping is the prime objective of a 12 hour flight. And when the cost of this flat bed seat often comes in cheaper than Premium Economy on major carriers, it just makes that night's sleep even sounder :)"
640,Vicky D,5,"Had international return flights and three internal flights in Vietnam, all with Vietnam airlines.  Cannot complain about any of the flights . All left on time and were comfortable. On some internal flights several children were not sitting during take off and landing, but this did not disturb the parents or stewardesses, so why bother checking that the adults had their seatbelts on? In the end my opinion was” why bother if parents are so irresponsible, not my problem”."
640,Neri.in.Wanderlust,5,"I flew Sydney-HCMC, Hanoi-Sydney and a few domestic flights during my month long Vietnam trip, all with great check in, cabin service, and best of all on time departures and arrivals. <br>Do yourself a favour and spend the extra few dollars to fly a reliable airline within Vietnam."
640,Jodie P,5,We flew economy class on one leg and Business on another.  Of course Business was roomy with all the added extras.  We were pleasantly surprised with Economy too.  the cabin was bright and clean and the leg room was excellent better than many others we have flown.  The customer service was friendly too.  There is only a small monitor to view between passengers and I was not offered headphones.  The entertainment system is the only real issue.Take off and landing were good.
640,Casey B,5,"Vietnam Airlines was above standard of every other airline I've flown with. The crew were lovely and the food was great! Especially appreciated the crew member on our flight back home to Australia from Saigon on the night of December 4th. He was so helpful the whole flight whenever we needed anything, and distracted and comforted me when I was experiencing a lot of ear pain as the plane descended. Thanks again legend! Definitely flying with Vietnam Airlines when I return to Saigon."
641,Simon R,4,OK they lost my suitcase but that was the fault of the check in<br>lady (otherwise they would ave got 5 stars}.<br>I eventually got it back thanks to the excellent head office  service.<br>The airline was very punctual and every one on board were very helpful.<br>So I would definitely recommend them
641,PsychOMelbourne,4,"This was a direct Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City flight. The flight departed and arrived on time, our luggage arrived as well, and the food was good. The service was excellent. We will definitely fly Vietnam Airlnes again."
641,sonnysam,5,"Ok travellers, forget Jetstar and incompatible staff, the low cost airline etc,  because no matter the class here, pay that little extra for no stop and every passenger is treated first class here by the way. <br>I can still remember my first flight and just before boarding. Waiting for the check in line to open and out come the fresh flowers on each desk, the nice greeting as you approach the desk. This is what I call customer service. On boarding the flight stepping on board ""good morning sir"" and the beautiful music before take off. No delays whatsoever, in the times I have travelled, on time every time. The pleasant service of chicken or beef soft drink and tea I cannot compliment VA any further as to me this is always a five star service no matter which class you decide to choose. And on touch down in HCM an applause because the pilots did an awesome job too. Thank you VA for 772 and 773s awesome every time. :)))"
641,Neilo1960,5,"Wow, we were delighted with this airline, it's boarding efficiency, great food and drinks. Good old fashioned service and no additional costs. Did four internal flights in Vietnam within two weeks and all were fine. Looking forward to travelling with Vietnam airlines again on next visit. Highly recommend."
641,AuthentikTravel,4,"Vietnam airlines is the best one in Vietnam. I took many returned flights Hanoi to Yangon, they were always on time with a good light dinner in cabin. Friendly staffs!"
642,Lokendra S,3,We recently did Vietnam and cambodia trip and used vietnam airlines few times to travel between aus and Vietnam and domestic as well. We found them bit underwhelming and more of a budget airline. Food was ok and service was also so so. Staff did communicate maybe too shy about english. Would recommend them for domestic but not international.
642,Thuan L,4,The flights were on time and smooth. The online checking and boarding with the online checkin code is very convenient.
642,Thuan L,3,The departure was delayed 45 min. The flights were good and smooth. The services provided is OK. In overall the trip was good.
642,ElaineMI,3,"We flew Vietnam Airlines 3 times during our recent trip. The route above, from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh and then Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok.  Each flight was 20-30 minutes late.  The route above because of operational problems with the airplane; the other two times because of delays.  Each delay usually came with a gate change and we learned to check the gate listing frequently after having to move across the airport.  They still believe in service on their flights: we received towelettes to clean ourselves and drinks on a one hour flight and a meal on the flight to Bangkok, though it was barely 2 hours.  Attendants were very courteous and attentive."
642,KellieMcK,5,"I would like to commend Vietnam Airlines.  We flew from Siem Reap, Cambodia to Hanoi and Hanoi to Hong Kong.  <br><br>I am mobility limited and need a wheelchair.  I requested special service from Vietnam Airlines and they went way out of their way to accommodate me.  I interacted with at least 30 people from Vietnam Airlines in the course of planning and taking my trip and every single person did everything they could for me and they did it with a smile.<br><br>On our second night in Hanoi, I fell and broke my arm.  Vietnam Airlines got me on a flight back to Hong Kong the next morning, so that I could get back to San Francisco as quickly as possible to have surgery to install metal plates in my arm to hold my bones together.  They took great care with me to ensure the safety of my broken arm.<br><br>In addition, their aircrafts are excellent and I had the best meal that I have ever had in coach.  It was a seafood medley with calamari, shrimp and scallops in a delicate tomato sauce.<br><br>I was leery of flying Vietnam Airlines, but they are much better than most US airlines.  I highly recommend them."
643,Patrick,2,"I did fly for the first time with Vietnam Airlines on this long haul flight from Hanoi to Paris on the very new A350. I had high expectation as Asian 4 star airlines usually have a very hight quality of service. I was disappointed. The food on Vietnam Airlines is of very bad quality, for both dinner and breakfast. You just get the main dish, a small salad and a tiny desert. The quality of the main dish is just disgusting. The breakfast (scrambled egg, tomato, bacon and beans), is litterally swimming in the fat. For breakfast you also get a bread with butter, but the not even serve you a marmelade. Nothing is served between the two main meals during this long flight, not even a small ice cream and cabin crew don't pass by serving drinks. Cabin crew are not really interacting with passenger, they are not rude, but just average friendly. Far away from the warm asian hospitality. The only good point is that in this new a350 the seat pitch is good, you don't feel cramped in the seat. But also with the aircraft I had problems. My seat lean, as well as the one of other passenger around me did not recline, it was broken, I was in the back of the plane and in this section of the plane there is no overhead compartments for storing your hand luggage because the crew restrooms are located there. So there was not enought storage room for passenger belongings. The personal screen is fixed and you can not adjust it when the passenger in front of you reclines, meaning that when he reclines you won't see the images anymore in the screen very good. The choice of movies and music in the inflight entertainement system is poor. Carpet in the plane was full of stains giving the plane a dirty and filthy aspect which was in a huge contrast with this brand new aircraft.<br>I do not recommend Vietnam Airlines for long haul in economy and hardly reccommend Air France which I took to fligh vrom Paris to Vietnam two weeks earliers and offered me a much better service, tasteful food an a much warmer and welcome on board."
643,Josephine_UK16,1,"Reasonable food. Staff though were quite aloof and they did not seem to offer water very much. I think this was the worst long haul flight I have been on as the seats were incredibly narrow, besides the standard lack of leg room you get on planes. I had a really awful person sat next to me who kept sitting sideways and leaning their back over onto my seat, preventing me from sleeping. They were very unpleasant when I tried to politely ask them not to lean on me and the staff did nothing to help."
643,chrisandliz5,4,"Australia, especially Qantas could take a leaf out of this airlines setup.  We were surprised and very happy with the seating room on these internal flights."
643,Faulks,5,"The crew were welcoming, we didn't have to ask for a thing everything was supplied, we knew they had done it before as they were well versed in all our needs and seem to know when we would require something."
643,Marcell_54,3,"It was my first time with Vietnam airlines, the plane is nice, their facility is better than budget airlines. i thought i will have a great time with my travel, but i'm quite surprised with their crew attitude. Their attitude was rude, i still don't understand why they behave like that. I'll try again next time and i hope it can be better. It's such a beautiful country and it will be great if they provide better service."
644,Denis H,5,We flew with Webjet deal and Vietnam Airlines lived up to their reputation.  It is only a short flight but very comfortable.  Comfort and meals were very good.  Would recommend them.
644,HAPPYASH,5,"Recently we went to Vietnam and Cambodia. We flew seven times during our holiday. London to Ho Chi Min, Ho Chi Min to Cambodia. One internal flight in Cambodia. Siam Reap to Ho Chi Min. Ho Chi Min to Danang. Danang to Hanoi. Hanoi to London. The service from start to finish was superb. All check-in at all the airports were very easy and the staff were always helpful and just took minutes. Very efficient indeed. Both international and domestic flights were well organised and inflight service was great. <br>Would recommend and travel Vietnam Airlines again for sure."
644,our56,3,"Decided to go with VN due to the convenience of the arrival time. Leaving in the morning and arriving in the afternoon is good timing if you are doing an all inclusive tour package which starts from your pick up from the airport.<br>Food was ok much like other airlines although on the return trip less appetizing due to it not really catering to western palette. Apart from that is was good, staff were good and entertainment system good too."
644,Stephen,5,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines on many occasions primarily to destinations within Vietnam and SEA in General, however, more recently I took a long haul flight with my wife and 21 month old daughter with Vietnam Airlines from Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City, I booked the seats in Premium Economy Class due to the extra space and larger seats. The aircraft type of this route is a Boeing Dreamliner and Premium class is situated between Business and Economy classes. <br>Premium Class also offers priority check-in and boarding. The in flight service is excellent on this 11hr Direct flight, good in flight entertainment with plenty of channels to choose from, the food was of a good standard and all in all an enjoyable flight which departed and arrived on time."
644,wireless_in_CA,4,"I flew Vietnam airlines from HAN to PVG and overall experience was very good.<br><br>Check in was crazy with the lines for Economy snaking all the way into the main walk area.  I highly recommend that you do the on line check in.  If you forget then head over to Row H (the Sky priority and business check in area) and there will be about four automated kiosks.  You need to have your reservation number as the last name and flight number option did not let any of my co workers check in.  After printing out your boarding pass we then entered the Sky priority area and dropped off our bags.<br><br>Once through customs ( a lot faster leaving the country than entering by far) and security (must remove shoes, belt, laptop and place in trays) then we headed to Gate 28.  If you need snacks or drinks there are various restaurants nearby with all prices in USD. <br><br>The queue to board went quickly.  However they had to recheck a couple of us who did the kiosk check in.  It was not clear why.<br><br>Once on board there were a good number of open seats so I had my row to myself.  Overhead storage was good.  Each seat had its own entertainment screen (though my screen had a glitch and the system reset itself halfway through my movie).   Decent selection of Asian and English movies along with a flight tracker.  Seat comfort was good.  Bathroom was clean as well as good overall condition of the plane as it was a newer 787.<br><br>Lunch was served on this flight and I was given the choice of fish or beef with vegetables and rice.  Beef and veggies were cooked with lemongrass and I found it to be quite flavorful for a plane meal.  My coworkers told me the fish also was a good choice.  A shrimp and cold vegetable (no idea what) was crisp, a bit tart but good.  Three pieces of fruit (melon, apple and watermelon) rounded out the meal with a cold roll.  The drink cart followed along with coffee and tea service.  <br><br>Overall flight was uneventful.  Landing was on time but we had to taxi a long way to our gate (at least 10-15 minutes).  We passed the new terminal under construction and it looks like another massive one adding a lot more capacity.<br><br>China customs was really slow so I thought my luggage would already be unloaded.  Not the case.  In addition while waiting at baggage claim they changed our carousel at the last minute and bags finally started coming out.  However before long there was approximately ten minute stoppage before the next set of bags came out.  Not sure who was responsible for that delay - VN or PVG."
645,stevelamb7777,4,"The airline was on time , seats were ok leg room was good , service and food were good . Much better than expected , would not hesitate to fly them again ."
645,elizabethsandra,5,"It was my second time flying with Vietnam Airlines. The first one was three years ago from KL to London. Due to great experience from my first flight, I chose it again to fly to Hanoi.<br><br>Reasonable price, good service, good food, good end to end customer experience from booking the flight ticket online until you land at your destination."
645,AntonThailand,5,"Great food, menus supplied. Beverage constant throughout the flight. Heritage magazine a good read.<br>Turbulence handled for 35 minutes without incidents.<br>Professional crew."
645,rezzal_ismail,4,"The food was good<br>the airfare sometimes u can get lower (see if they have a promo)<br>but no IFE, quite sad. please bring any books with you."
645,Michael G,4,"Great airline, had to reschedule date, no trouble at all. didn't loose all payment just part, which I thought was okay. Crew was great."
646,Grant L,5,The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a great plane for travel. Vietnam Airlines are flying these and they offer great leg room even in economy class. The cabin crew were very friendly and offered great in flight service. I will fly with them again.
646,Midwifemarie,5,"My husband &amp; I were flying to Russia via Vietnam neither of which we had been to before we chose Vietnam Airlines on price and it was worth every penny. The service was impeccable from the time you check in to the time you land.<br><br>The planes the airline uses are less than a year old so still brand spanking new, clean, comfortable and spacious. The crew were amazing nothing was to much for them and the thing I liked most it was all done with a genuine smile so rare on airlines today (we are well traveled so recognise real service when we see it) The food was excellent and plentiful as were the drinks. <br><br>In total we did 6 flights with Vietnam Airlines all fantastic and if I have my way will only fly this airline for any future European trips."
646,Michelle F,5,Great experience lots of leg room and seat great staff were friendly and service was excellent plane was very comfortable
646,Anita F,3,"Flew return in November. Check in was fine flights on time. Staff on flight not very attentive. Very little information from the flight deck. Food was poor. Cooked breakfast both ways was cold. They ran out of some spirits after a couple of hours into the journey and wine was poured from a bottle not served in mini bottles and they only served half a glass. Staff were very slow to respond to call buttons. Toilets were not maintained and by the end of the journey ,filthy.   In flight entertainment limited and poor. Would not book again. <br><br>Obviously a safe journey is the most important but on such a long journey these little things make it more bearable."
646,Christopher N,4,"First time in Premium Economy on a 787 Dreamliner, and seating was roomy and comfortable despite being in centre aisle of 3 seats. IFE equipment good and service ok. Catering identical to standard economy fare. Rearmost row of seats  separated from rest of cabin by curtain only, beware as 1st row behind is often populated with mothers with noisy infants. Dreamliner aircraft is superb, cabin crew safety training poor however, armrest tv screens left up on take off and on return landing passenger with seat fully reclined, tv screen erected and no seat belt!  Internal flight Siemens Reep to Hanoi on 737, faultless service, safety protocols and timekeeping."
647,8Robsuepal,4,"Good flight - on time. Long flight but inflight entertainment was good, Food alright. No better or worse than expected."
647,adam i,4,"I enjoy my food and Vietnam airlines did themselves justice in the way of service and food quality, service was good,seating was good,a alround pleasant experience and I will give them the big thumbs up"
647,Sandy W,5,"Excellent flight. Direct to Hanoi Vietnam, about 13 hrs. Plane was full but quite a quiet journey.<br>Would recommend direct flight and vietname airlines.<br>I had an issue on our return flight, but they managed to help me out and were very prompt."
647,Olivia R,5,"We actually flew Vietnam Air several times over a 2 week period.  The flights were on time, the staff was very helpful, fares were very inexpensive in country.  The planes we flew were mostly older (even though they do have newer planes) but comfortable enough for 3 hours flights.  The airline serves full meals even during 1 hour flights.  The food was nothing special but was good.  Wine is complementary, including refills and to finish off the meal they serve tea.  We would definitely fly Vietnam Air again!"
647,4stack,4,"very smooth flight, pleasant cabin staff and food as good as any other airline I have flown with. Choice of films could have been better but found enough to occupy a 12 hour flight."
648,S5148SIrobertc,4,The aeroplane was a new dream maker plane which was excellent. Very comfortable. My only concern was that in economy class we could not book seats in advance. My husband had a back complaint so needed an isle seat. This was left to chance on the day of departure as we booked in. A family of 3 by us was split up which was a pity as the flight was 13 hours. With planning this could easily have been avoided as single travelers were seated in rows of 3.<br><br>Service on the plane was good and food pleasant.
648,Georgina G,4,"The plane was comfortable enough, but because we were part of a tour, were not able to book in online and choose our seats.  At the rear of the aircraft, both going out and coming back, by the time the food service reached us, no choice was left.  We therefore went hungry."
648,Ian S,4,"It's an early departure from Hanoi, 01.25 in the morning, when I board I'm the only western tourist on the flight and I'm greeted by name at the boarding gate, a nice touch. Once on board and airborne drinks are served, later it's time for breakfast.<br>I just wanted to sleep after the drink but even though I turned down breakfast, after serving everyone else and clearing up, they came back to my seat to see if I might still want food.<br>I like the friendliness and the attention they show to passengers, it is one of the nicest airlines to fly and if you're flying to Vietnam and then on elsewhere they are worth thinking about."
648,Ian S,5,"I like this airline, I get on board, I'm greeted with a smile and the whole flight is a joy. After food and it's an overnight flight I keep asking for a whisky, I don't want to sleep and every time I go to the galley they have one waiting for me. <br>The cabin crew are lovely, I like that they wear the national costume(for women) and nothing seems too much trouble.<br>The film package is great, a mix of Hollywood and Vietnamese, plus anime(I got to see Your Name at last)."
648,gerrymccleery,5,"Good selection of music and movies. First class meals especially a very good breakfast.. We were very impressed by mini magnum in the middle of the night, a real uplift."
649,MarkMShark,3,"One leg in the aisle, one folded over. Pleaeeese passenger in front of me don't recline...<br>Oh damn now I am stuck and squashed"
649,Steve T,4,Good service on a well designed and fitted out 787 from London. The food and drinks were as good as other airlines flying to the region. The more local flight to PP was fine with a sandwich snack and drink.
649,EastmeetsWestAB,4,This is the second time that we flew with Vietnam airlines. The service is great. Staff is very friendly. The business class seat is very comfortable and food is good.<br><br>The airport lounge is ok. Nothing to wow about.<br><br>The transfer from one airline to another is a bit annoying.  We need to wait for quiet sometime on the transfer desk before being issued a boarding pass. There are no seats available while u are waiting. Just a long quene.
649,Karin F,3,"Very long way to go from our original flight arrival (from Dubai) to the check in and boarding of Vietnam airlines. On board only a glas of water, no other choice"
649,turnelld,5,We were well looked after aircraft was great (Dreamliner) food was part British and part Vietnam you had the Joice
650,Jeremystravels,4,"We decided to pay a bit extra for premium economy seats.  Looking at the Vietnam Airline's website they appeared to have a good deal of extra legroom and wider seats in their 787 (Dreamliner) aircraft.  The extra cash is certainly worthwhile for a 12 hour plus flight such as this.  There are two fewer seats in a row so you get a much wider seat, with plenty of legroom; it's a bit like business class used to be back in the day before the advent of flatbeds.  There's a much bigger difference in Premium Economy here than, for example, in British Airways. Decent sized screens are stowed in the armrests, definitely better that seatback ones, and I enjoyed a couple of good films (though with Vietnamese subtitles which you can't get rid of).  The headphones they provide are (in common with most airlines, except Emirates) pretty useless, so take your own noise-cancelling ones, otherwise you won't be able to hear the film if you're in a noisy seat!  .  Food was so-so, but service generally good with very polite crew.  All in all, a good comfortable flight.  Hanoi Airport was rather chaotic, too few customs and immigration staff leading to long queues; and with a lack of announcements; so was boarding, but I blame the airport for that."
650,austenjoseph,5,Initially was not sure about this airline but have no regrets. We traveled in premium economy to/from due to the duration. Very comfortable and relaxed at the end of journey. courteous cabin crew and no complaints about the food
650,Thomas F,4,"I flew economy because why pay more of a one hour flight? The planes that I flew on were clean and the flight crew seemed very good. The food was what you would expect, not very good. <br>The flights left the gate very close to on schedule and landing was on time. <br>Would i use them again? Yes."
650,Norma J,5,"had never flown Vietnam Airlines before so didn't know what to expect.  They were brilliant!  The check in at the airport was speedy and well organised, the flight was on time and the aircraft was new, clean and comfortable with plenty of leg room.  the flight was quite short but they still provided a snack for us, which was very enjoyable.  As we were travelling through Vietnam and cambodia we had another 2 internal flights with this airline and again all of them were excellent.  This seems to be a really god company and I would have no hesitation in flying with them again."
650,Hilary T,2,We had a great holiday in Vietnam and internal flights with Vietnam Airlines were fine but flights to and from UK with their international crews were very poor. Service was sparce and food served was only warm - they had nearly 10 hours to get our breakfast hot but no - it wasn't hot or tasty. Dreamliner (Boeing 787) may be good and economical for airlines but very noisy for passengers from about row 20 back (= all of economy) and even with noise reduction headphones we got very little sleep. If we have to use them again the we will have to pay for upgrade and hope the food and service is better there.
651,peter c,5,"This flight is a overnight one leaving HCMC at 9.15pm (local time) and arriving at 9.30 AEDST the next day.<br>I had booked Economy class but received an upgrade to Premium Economy !! Great legroom in my seat 12K, as indeed in all the seats.  Two meals were served, dinner just after leaving  and breakfast about an hour and a half before arrival in Sydney.  The service is all smiles and quiet efficiency.   A great airline to fly with."
651,kevin-the-gerbil,3,"23 hour door to door travel with 12 hour leg on Hanoi to LHR. <br>food was ok but just two meals.<br>seats a bit small - I'm 6'' 16 st.<br>movies same as when we flew out 2 weeks earlier<br>staff efficient - but banged into me every time they passed without so much as a by-your-leave<br>everybody must have had a cough / cold by the time they got home due to incessant sneezing but worse, coughing up phlegm by some passengers."
651,Alexandra M,4,"It was our first flight with Vietnam Airlines and I can highly recommend them. The main plus is a decent legroom (definitely more than Lufthansa) and a fast and courteous service. They are not as overly friendly as Thai Airways (for example), but kind to children, punctual and good quality airline food. My kid really enjoyed the onboard entertainment (cartoons) as did I (vietnamese movies) and my husband (Hollywood movies. VA flies directly from FRA, so its also convenient for us as Frankfurt locals. The prices were at ca. 750 € per Person. There would have been cheapert flights over Peking or the Emirates, but thats a NoGo for us as a family. I can gladly recommend VA."
651,Yvonne a,4,"Budget airline.  Only a short haul flight.  However, I found the staff to be polite and friendly.  The food which was not expected was fine."
651,Matt Hermann,5,"We traveled with Vietnam Airlines to get from the North to the South. It was a very nice and short flight, but you still get something to eat! Good fresh food, very kind flight crew."
652,Celia V,3,"The plane was new. The attendants were nice, as usual and there were choices for asian or western food. The screen worked properly and there were different options to choose, however subtitles are always in Vietnamese. Sound options are mainly english, french or vietnamese. The space in the seat is average and the back of the seat was comfortable. Both flighs were full."
652,jandl-b,4,"Flew as part of a package and was offered an upgrade at a bargain price, so took it. <br>Never flown a Dreamliner before but what a great aircraft. This was complemented by efficient, attentive cabin crew, who even though they weren't the most cheerful bunch in the world made the flight comfortable. The in flight meals were pretty good, the entertainment centre also good, not as much European content as other flights I've been on but plenty to keep you occupied.<br>Overall a very comfortable flight."
652,Kipper_11,4,Flight was full and boarding a little chaotic.  Surely this can be organised better?  Seating a little cramped but could have been worse.  Food was first rate but service a little surly. Let and arrived just about on time.  generally I was impressed and would fly with then again.  Will try the London Hong Kong flight.
652,Phil H,3,"The first flight from Danang was late leaving, then the flight from Ho Chi Min was another  hour late leaving.<br>Normally after take off you get peanuts and a drink( after being late twice, I need one) but they skipped the drink. The meal wasn’t served until 11pm, a drink was offered after the meal. <br>On two seperate attempts I asked for another drink but it never came. Some of the passengers when up and got another drink them selves.<br>This is not the first time this has happen to us on Vietnam Airlines, I think they are becoming another Jetstar, unreliability!<br>These people don’t understand “Customer Service”<br>Many passengers ordered a meal but were give a different meal than they asked for, they just don’t listen or care."
652,Rose ann C,5,"This was the first time I have flown Vietnam Airlines  I did a round trip from Melbourne Australia via Ho Chi Min City (in transit) to Hong Kong for 4 days the service on the flight was not a problem and the flight crew were very helpful and pleasant<br>Service was impeccable, we had a meal when we took off and the before landing another meal before we arrived in Hi Chi Min City after getting on our connecting flight we had another meal given before we arrived in Hong Kong I have never known so much food on a trip<br>Leaving Hong Kong we flew into Hanoi<br>As we were flying Domestic for the next 3 weeks from North to South of the country, without going into each destination and boring you I would just like to say that I will be flying this airline again I have a lot of praise for the flight crew on each flight (8 flights in total)"
653,Sherpa Lama Dawa,5,"My husband, son and my ticket we booked online but dunno how there was a mistake in my name. So I had to buy another new ticket and had to mail for a refund. Luckily after 2 months I did get. Thank you Vietnam Airlines 👍"
653,Leanne C,5,Very comfortable plane ! Was on time ! Food was very good ! Seats were extra comfortable ! Watched latest movies ! Staff were helpful and pleasant . The windows are the lastest with them dimming during flight making it very relaxing! Eight hours went quickly ! A drink was offered and enjoyed ! We would recommend this airline highly !
653,Bas V,4,"If you can afford to travel by plane from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City: do it!<br>By ferry and bus takes at least 10 hours or more. Maybe that is cheaper: 25 euros but the flight only takes one 1 hour plus 1 hour extra to be in advance on the airport.<br>If you book in time, the tickets start from 35 euro. In my case unfortunately 100 euros each. But still worth choosing this travel possibility.<br>Vietnam Airlines is a reliable Airline and the queues to board are good (better than for the  other Airlines like e.g. Vietjet or Jetstar."
653,sad7au,4,"My wife got sick on the plane they were so professional and caring.Nothing was a problem luckily there was a doctor on board the plane.We had a few flights in Vietnam 4 in total International and domestic all of high standards.The food was good,the plane was clean and the toilets were constantly cleaned.I would not hesitate to fly with them again."
653,Possumniner,5,"We love this airline and looked forward to our first Business Class flight, with flatbed seats. The level of luxury was amazing and there was room to spare. The food and the service were exemplary as on the outward flight BUT the plane was very hot and above row three there were no vents for cooling. It got a little uncomfortable."
654,Carol K,4,"We were recommended to use Vietnam airlines from Luxury Escapes as part of package. We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of check in, boarding, smoothness of flight and quality of meals supplied.  The staff were courteous and polite and very helpful.  My only criticism was the in flight entertainment was old and limited."
654,Possumniner,4,"Excellent service, great food in Premium Economy, with very good legroom and very comfortable seats. 787 Dreamliner, so spacious, smooth and big windows."
654,jOhnheritage58,4,"We recently undertook a tour of Vietnam which involved two international and three domestic economy flights with Vietnam Airlines. In short, given the budget pricing, we were pleasantly surprised. The aircraft on all sectors seemed relatively new, clean and interiors well maintained. Without asking, we were offered exit row on the first international flight, which was a bonus because the seat spacing is limited. The meals were quite good on the international sectors, but the drinks trolley made relatively few passes. Only water was offered on the short domestic routes. The entertainment mix was quite good and the earphones ok. The toilets were regularly checked and cleaned. Check in was rather slow in the larger domestic airports. With one exception the aircraft left on time. We would be happy to travel with Vietnam Airlines in future."
654,Mark C,5,Flight attendants were friendly n polite.I had a early morning flight everything went well from the start.Price was great.
654,Jean C,3,"Flight was booked through UK travel agent. Unable to prebook preferred seats which was a problem. Also had been told they did not have Premium Economy, but they did. Perhaps Travel Agent problem, but could also be because of online portal to agents, or their communication. <br>Did online checkin not long after flight was opened, and found the seats we were assigned were last row, right beside the toilet &amp; galley. Spent most of layover time trying to find someone who was authorised to change the seats. Finally found someone and was changed to about 8 rows forward of that, and did get an aisle seat. Service and meals were just OK. Not much choice of movies, no new releases. Not the best flight experience"
655,Brian Peterson,5,Have flown Vietnam Airline for every trip to Vietnam over the last 12 years and from my experiences would not fly with any other airline no matter what the price difference may be. An absolute fantastic airline.
655,Marie B,5,"This company would have to have the best roomy, clean fresh looking planes.<br>I am comparing this to Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and United airlines.<br>I realise they don’t travel all around the world but consider them for your next trip if your going vietnam way. Very comfortable for an 8 hr direct flight ."
655,BarangPP,4,"Generally Vietnam Airlines is quite good. Service on ground and flight are reasonable and I prefer to fly with them in Indochina. On this flight however they made bad mistake. I had business class ticket and I did not get my lunch before complained. I know that they do serve those who are upgraded from tourist class to business class with business menu, but one rude air-hostess did not notice my ticket class and refuced to serve before I asked to talk with her boss. I have flied more than 300 times with them and I forgive, but if it has had been my first flight this airline I would never step their flight again."
655,Stephen M,4,"Reasonable room in the seats. Entertainment was good alouth one of our companions didn’t work. Food, I thought was pretty good."
655,Stephen N,3,"In the month I was due to fly I received 4 e-mails with flight time changes. At 1 stage I had 2.45 hours lay over till my next flight and that went from there to 13 hours then back to 11 hours. Finally I decided to settle in for a long wait but after complaining to ground staff I was given complimentary access to wait in business lounge. On return journey 3 more e-mails with alterations. No more flights with this airline for me. At least you know where you stand with the major bus companies as their schedules are pretty much bang on time. You save money, get the view and do not get screwed around."
656,nlhAustralia,4,"From the moment we entered the lounge at Sydnet airport, the service was great.  Seats were very comfortable...also in flat position.  Meals very good.<br>The only part where they fall down is in Saigon and the lounge there is mediocre.  Food is of a lower standard by far from Sydney.  I would suggest that they check their food...if the food is supposed to be hot...then it SHOULD be hot, which was not the case. There should also be a wider range of food."
656,James C,5,Best valur for momey. Full size seat. Onle two in all sections.  Beautiful Dreamliner.  On time. Food good and drinks service great.  Have flown 5 times and will do again.  The new Dreamliner is quiet and graceful.
656,serenityGymea,4,"Having read some very mixed reviews we embarked on this trip with some level of skepticism! This was also fuelled By price being so much lower than other airlines<br>Well our fears were unfounded. Apart from check in with quantas staff who was not well informed and suggesting we change seats as she believed our aircraft had been changed from Ho Chi Minh so glad we did not as she was wrong!<br><br>The lounge in Sydney was very good. On board lovely new aircraft Dreamliner! The service was great and staff English very good. Great attention to,detail. Lovely and food wine / drinks selection . <br>On arrival in Ho Chi Minh we were greeted by Vietnam airlines staff member and guided through customs with complimentary visa followed by transport and hotel accomodation to rest and freshen before onward journey to Paris. This also included dinner at the hotel. And return airport transfer. Again guided through check in and all formalities! All complimentary! Excellent service. The sector from Ho Chi Minh to Paris another great trip! Well done Bietnam airlines we will definitely be flying you again especially at the prices you offer for business class!"
656,Julie L,5,We did 2 international flights and 2 internal flights with Vietnam Airlines. All flights were great and on time. Check in was easy and announcements were made in English and Vietnamese. <br><br>There were food places to eat. Places to charge your phone. And announcements giving updates on flights. <br><br>The flight was comfortable and the food good. <br><br>Would definitely fly Vietnam Airlines again
656,Sagitaur,3,"I had a 10.30am flight and arrived at Incheon around 8.30.  Just as well, as the airport was very busy.  Business class check-in was efficient, but unfortunately their is no special provision for fast-tracking business class passengers through immigration and customs clearance.<br>Finding my way to the gate was a bit of an odyssey, as requiring a train trip, and about 4 escalators to the lounge.  Now the lounge is dreadful.  Selection of food and drinks was very poor.<br>However, boarding did see an improvement, with a special entry for business class.<br>On board, the A350 was fine.  I had a very nice Korean-themed lunch, all beef, topped off with a nice red.  VN in-flight entertainment is not the best going.<br>Cabin service was poor, and not what you would expect from business-class.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that we had stewards in lieu of stewardesses, but the men just did not have the skills expected from staff at the front of the cabin.<br>All in all, rather average, and on my next trip to Korea I will try Korean airlines."
657,Lindsaymh,5,"We flew from Sydney to London with Vietnam Airlines in June 2017. I was slightly hesitant after reading some of the Tripadvisor reviews. However, I suspect the poorer reviews are for more local flights. This trip was on new Dreamliner aircraft which are superb. We flew Premium, which was the same price as some economy seats with other airlines. I think these seats are cheaper if you fly straight through. The downside is there is a 9-hour wait in Vietnam. However, you can get a transit visa and the airline supplies a hotel room or a tour which you can use while you wait. I only stumbled on this service by chance. It wasn't obvious from the website. But it's a big plus. There are also bed pods in the airport, but I didn't see them so not sure on quality. Would definitely use again to get above average seats at a reasonable price. Service onboard was perfectly fine.<br>The ratings here are not what I wanted to submit - website would only allow 5 stars or nothing! Legroom 3. Seat comfort 3. Entertainment 3. Customer service 4. Value 5. Cleanliness 5. Check-in 4. Food 4. <br>These ratings are against other premium flights I have taken. Everything was more than satisfactory for the price."
657,liandi,4,very comfortable flight on the latest 787 dreamliner!<br>direct to Saigon in 8 hours.<br>most comfortable plane currently flying and service was as good as Qantas
657,Evelyn H,4,"Seats are acceptable. Meals are delicious! Can't boast about their in-flight entertainment though. 3 rows of passengers sharing a small screen and so they can only play generic programs like ""Just For Laughs"". <br>Will still fly with Vietnam Airlines for short flights. After all, they are a full fledged carrier, and hence, you get meals and baggage allowance as opposed to budget airlines."
657,josie j,5,"Great service, flight attendants very pleasant, good food, comfortable flight. would fly with them again I had plenty of room as i am only a small person."
657,waget,4,it was a short flight for a business meeting. went in the early morning and came back at night. the morning flight was okay but the evening flight was delayed. overall experience is okay.
658,David M,5,"A friendly welcome, 30kg luggage each, hospitality on board including free beer, wine &amp; whiskey and 2 meals made our trip begin and end with a smile on our faces. <br>Despite a few delays, they informed us of the issue and did their best to get us to our connection which they did. <br>Friendly staff and comfortable plane ✈️ made a great trip. Highly recommended"
658,Leonie B,5,"Efficient, comfortable and reliable airlilne, very helpful  getting on and off the flight, comfortable seats"
658,CulturalMediator,4,"Perceptions can be distortions, that's for sure. I've travelled on some fairly 'rough' airlines in Asia, as well as the best.. this flight challenged by bias and ignorance thats for sure. Vietnam Airlines is up among the better airlines, they have tried hard and achieved well in service, comfort, food, in flights and smiles."
658,Clive L,4,"The return flight booked was Premium Economy, not Business Class. The trip was via Ha Noi and on the return trip the journey was broken at Ha Noi were I stayed for eight days. These flights used the Boeing 747 and the premium economy seats were quite wide and comfortable.  I was most disappointed when the menu I was given showed that it was for Economy Class. When I questioned the steward I was told that Economy Class and Premium Economy got the same food. The food was not to my liking at all and after tasting it I refused to eat at all. Fortunately I am able to go without food on 24 hr flights or longer. The stewards did not seem to be concerned that I did not accept their food and made no effort to provide me with any alternate meals. I would have thought that they could have asked me to try the Business Class food. I will try their Business Class next trip to UK as their fares are quite competitive."
658,Dr_Noel,4,"Efficient, well organised and polite service. Comfortable seating and on-time departure.Check in was handled well with more than adequate staff assistance."
659,debbieR9195TF,5,"I flew to Heathrow and return to Sydney, all 4 flights were great.<br>There is a stopover on the way to Heathrow and a longer stopover on the way back to Sydney via Hanoi.<br>As we had a 19 hour stop over in Hanoi, Vietnam airlines arranged a car from the airport to a 4* accomodation at the Light Hotel for us.<br>After a couple of hours rest we were then taken on a private tour of Hanoi, given dinner in a traditional family restaurant and given an opportunity to do some shopping before returning to the airport for the second leg of our journey.<br>The airline arranged the visa, we just needed to provide passport photos and book the visit stay through our travel agent"
659,David W,2,"This was the second of three international flights we made this year and the first time we had flown with VA. Never again. Very poor cabin service, Unfriendly at best. Such a contrast to Royal Brunei Airlines which we used in May. <br>House entertainment was 3rd rate. My wife's screen was faulty. She had to move to an empty seat as little attempt was made to fix it. Poorly handled.<br>The food was very ordinary for Business Class. Vietnamese food is usually fantastic. We requested a snack and were advised that the meal was about to be served. This came 90 minutes later! <br>Overall - forgettable."
659,Oon S,5,1. Service was on par with Singapore Airlines<br><br>2. Value for money<br><br>3. Seats were actually wider than Singapore Airlines !!
659,Kasey L,3,"My flight was changed to a different gate and was delayed, once I eventually boarded it was again delayed almost an hour. Once the plane was in the air however and the food and drinks were served I felt quite comfortable. The seats were not hugely comfortable and not a lot of choice for movies.<br><br>Staff were lovely and attentive from checkin to the in plane service to leaving. The amount of checked baggage was fantastic. I would rate 7/10"
659,Tuan N,2,"I'm a frequent flyer of VNA for about 7 years. Normally, I'm OK with domestic flight, flying time about 2-3 hrs maximum.<br><br>I bought VNA ticket for round trip from SGN to CDG but they code share with AF so first fight I took AF and return flight with VNA. That's why I have very good comparison between them.<br>- About the plane: it is new and no comment<br>- About the entertainment: have many choices abut not vary as AF<br>- About the flight attendant: they are OK, fulfill their duty but not reach to 4 star services because of not so caring.<br>- About the food: that is the worst thing I have ever experienced. The main meal is awful, very bad while the  snack is very limited and not delicious.<br><br>I think to reach to 4 star airlines as their advertising, they need to improve a lot."
660,judithc79,4,"The aircraft &amp; staff are always very helpful, courteous &amp; friendly.  The planes clean &amp; the food adequate &amp; plentiful. (For me).<br>The seats are a little cramped but okay for a reasonably sized person. <br>The standard has been high for my seven trips since 2001"
660,Lynne Z,3,"Super-cheap flights but I wouldn't recommend. Extremely slow check-in, very limited entertainment if you speak English, meals tasteless. Flight attendants nice when you saw them, which wasn't often.<br>Good if you're looking for cheap return flights to Europe, but you get what you pay for."
660,Gary M,4,"Hey TripAdvisor Reader, <br>So having never flown with Vietnam Airlines before I did not know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. <br>This is a well priced (Cheapest flight at the time of booking) full-service flight, towelettes and refreshments. Good choice of meals. <br>The in-flight entertainment was a good showing of current movies and shows. The attendants were helpful and polite. The restrooms were well maintained and had toothbrushes and shavers should the need arise. <br>Over the course of the flight, the windows were darkened to allow for those sleepier travellers to rest. We were given blankets and pillows which were comfortable.<br>I would recommend flying with the airline, and should the opportunity present itself I will again."
660,mariomarkanders,5,"for a small airline the service was good. usual seating, enough leg room and plane was very clean. airport process on domestic flight was very quick and queue very small."
660,steve a,5,Great trip highly recommend premium Economy the extra room made the whole trip I don't know that I can go back to economy Class again ! but the flights are always good with Vietnam airlines you are always well looked after
661,Tracy B,4,"First time flight with Vietnam Airlines, could not fault the comfort or the service.   The food was excellent, the plane was clean and spacious, and all flights were on time.  <br><br>Food and drinks were excellent, we were also provide with extras such as water and towellls"
661,jenril,5,the flight itself was excellent. aircraft was good - no shudders or crazy shakiness in air. crew service was excellent. had no trouble. crew do not insist that you need to take a seat in yr booked seat. if you are not comfortable you can actually stand aside and wait for all passengers to seat before you are allowed to pick a seat which you are comfy in. during both times (return) i was able to get 3 seater side so i could lie down! awesome.
661,stevenhall3,5,"This airline was a pleasure to fly with, flight attendants were attentive, good aircraft comfortable (Dreamliner). food was good airline quality. Would fly with them again"
661,Evelynne G,4,We were supposed to be on a QANTAS flight as they apparently co shared<br>We found out closer to departure that Qantas had put us on. Vietnam Airlines flight<br>We generally travel QANTAS but the Vietnam Airlines flight was very good <br>We did not eat the food as we preferred to sleep
661,WestYorksHomebird,3,"We were booked in Economy and didn’t find anything special about the flight.  The attendants were courteous and polite but not very friendly.  The food and drink was free and typical of airline food with two meals, both offering Vietnamese or western choice.  Snacks were not offered during the flight but you can have soft drinks when you want.  The console worked well but the choice of films was not brilliant although we were able to watch 3 during the flight which were OK.  The headsets given out were ok but not brilliant.   Economy seating felt cramped, especially when the person in front reclines their seat.  Premium economy looked a lot more comfortable it the price for this is not cheap.  <br><br>We had 3 internal flights with  Vietnam Airlines and these were just ordinary hour long flights with no frills, just a bottle of water given."
662,Siggi Hafsteins,4,"Comfortable seats, enough space (I am 183cm) and fine entertainment system. Everything was on time both departure and flying time and excellent service on board. Only negative thing was that they ran out of the meat course for dinner and I had to have fish that tasted not good, had noodles later on to make up for that."
662,Peter M,4,"I was impressed from the start, we checked in quickly and boarded on time a Dreamliner, almost new. Polite and helpful staff made for a pleasant flight."
662,Duncan P,5,"Probably the best flight I’ve been on. Vietnam airlines is great. The flight attendants were polite and very helpful. The meals very great. They generally had a western dish, such as beef or chicken, and then a Asian dish with rice and fish. And their bathrooms are so clean. They even have lemon scented deodorizer, so nice and a welcome change."
662,GM8868,3,We made 3 internal trips on Vietnam air and found them to be all ok. Pilots are good as the handling in strong winds was a challenging. We found all the flights a bit late for one reason or another
662,L7300TUchrisb,5,Vietnam Airlines fleet are new and the service was efficient and friendly at all levels. Thier dreamliners are comfortable and quiet and great for long flights and the windows shading technology really does help with adjusting to time zones. The food was okay. We'd fly with them again
664,Brian C,3,"A great airline with very acceptable in-flight service. <br>PROBLEM:  It seems impossible to get frequent flyer points credited to my account for 4 sectors flown in October. I've  applied online,  called the Sydney LotusMiles help line,  yet still no response. When I phoned, I was promised a same day return call.... Two days later,  I'm  still waiting. My first flights with LotusMiles... maybe  my last!"
664,MatildaSSC,4,"Very good cabin layout with 3-3-3 seats in Economy, plenty of leg room. Meals are okay. Crew services (particularly from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney) were outstanding, crew members acted quickly and professionally to defuse a volatile confrontation caused by some unruly Vietnamese travellers."
664,The_Chappells,3,Our first experience of flight delays which cost us a day in Hoi An. Only positive was our tour company kept us informed all the way through so it did minimise our time at the airport. Flight no frills from a service perspective and I suppose you get what you pay for. In the end we arrived safely and that is the most important thing.
664,Ruth W,4,"premier economy<br>Warm welcome, seats comfortable and large enough. on time. pleasant food choices. <br>Clean.<br>inhouse entertainment  not working.<br>domestic flights were also to the same standard."
664,Nita Sproston,4,Our 12 hour flight was very comfortable. Plenty of leg room.  Meal satisfactory. We then had an intennal flight from Can Tho to Hanoi. We were only given water on the plane - although the flight was only 1 hour. Our return flight from Hanoi back to Heathrow airport was again 12 hours. Meal satisfactory. Comfortable and plenty of leg space.<br>My only complaint would be that we arrived early at the airport on each occasion to book in and we were not given seats together. Other than that the flights were good and the service good at the airports and by the air hostesses.
665,raydnik,4,"Flew twice by VN. 1st from SGN (Ho Chi Minh ) to HAN ( Ha Noi) and then later to BKK Bangkok.THe domestic flight was so-so with just a snack for a near 2 hr flight and some coke/pepsi/water.Understandably,as it was 4pm.MY grouse was with the snack.No choice.Have received choices on doestic flights within India,even for 30 mts flights.An A350-900 with 3-4-3 seating was used for a domestic flight(presumably part of an international leg!)<br><br>The 2nd occasion was when I flew to BKK on their A321.Food was very good.Last minute request for a veggie meal was accomodated,even though I knew I should have ordered one.<br>IFE is ok.Did not work on the domestic sector.Did not try it on the A321.<br>Pluses-Budding airline.Fancy new fleet (B787-900s,A350-900s,A321s),part of Sky Team.<br>Cons- almost nothing.Will learn from experience."
665,JoeLim713,4,"Its was a great flight with this Airlines. Leg room is comfort, food was not bad. No delay. Will travel with them again for the next trip to Vietnam."
665,_allanlearyleary,2,Having flown out with this airline with comfort and good legroom the same was expected for the return. The return aircraft was scruffy and the seat spacing was that of a budget charter. 13 hours is not acceptable in these conditions. This airline will not be used again.
665,tava22,1,"Vietnam Airlines discrimated against my sister with prosthetic leg.  She is an above the knee amputee and the supervisor mentioned below made my sister remove her leg so they could put it through the scanner with the rest of the luggage. We had recently flown from HCMC to Hue and had no such treatment. We have flown various international airports and have never had this occur. Pham Thi Minh Tam, supervisor for Vietnam Airlines could not show written a policy from the airline or airport security.<br><br>They said when they found the policy they would email it to my sister. <br><br>The employee in question was a  Vietnam Airline employee and not airport security, as she was not in an airport security uniform but a Vietnam Blue and white uniform. Airport security made no issue of  it but it was the instance of the Vietnam Airlines employee that stated that it was your policy and not the policy of the airport. When I told her that we had flown your airline several days earlier she changed her story and said it was the policy of the airport. When I asked her to show us the policy she said she would email it to me. My sister should not have had to undress in front of airport security and have her leg removed and then taken from her to be put on the scanner with luggage. We are very applaud and disgusted that you would treat passengers with a disability like this. I have been to China, Dubai, Australia, Africa, Rome, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Peru, Ecuador, Germany and many other places in Europe and Caribbean Island and I have ever seen anything like this. Your airline should be very ashamed. I would never recommend this airline or even recommend visiting for that matter."
665,JPLondon100,1,Very bad service - booked on 3:05pm flight to make an onward connection and we were bumped off flight with no notice / apology and the staff didn't care at all. Never fly with them! This has happened twice now in a row. We have another flight soon and I am dreading it!!
666,aussietraveller57,3,"my wife and I fly premium economy when we holiday overseas. At twice the price of economy you expect some good travel. We travelled return Melbourne to HCMC. <br>ok.... separate PE  flight ticket desk was ok. <br>On board, no welcome drink. Seats are slightly smaller than other other airlines we have flown with. Entertainment on the Dreamliner, was a pullout side screen...was ok.<br>Food was economy food...with plastic cutlery.<br>Alcohol was offered once...but never saw the stewardesses again. Had to ask for water. No comfort pack??<br>I would look for other flight alternatives....it was just ok."
666,Sylvain R,4,"Its was a great flight, the food was good, the plane an seat confortable enough for 5to6 hours sleep, good movies selection, good drinks selection (chivas wiskey...for the one who like it) <br><br>I recommend this airline, took it on internal flight from Da nang to Ho Chi Minh and it waa good too"
666,Jerry Tai,4,Rated 4* by SkyTrax. Affordable and pleasant ride. Onboard meal is ok. No entertainment. Bring your own book or portable device. Overall a good experience coming from someone who usually travels by Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific.
666,Michael N,4,We flew in and out of Vietnam and also had 2 internal flights with Vietnam airlines.  We had never  used this airline before and were pleasantly surprised.  Each of the flights was on time and the cabins were clean and comfortable.  The food was excellent on the international flights and the cabin crew were very helpful.<br>Vietnam was wonderful and we would have no qualms about using this airline again.
666,FabGlobetrotter03,4,"I did not know what to expect since this was my first time using this airline but the service was very good, the leg room was better than that of many airlines, and the snack was good. I like this airline."
667,DayTrip741523,1,First<br>Flight got delayed 90 minutes before they cancelled. No announcement we had to all ask the gate staff what was happening.. paid for a bus into town and dropped us at 11pm. Next 2 flights have both been delayed by more than 45minutes... for an hour and half flight... get your act together Vietnam Airlines. If u want to see the inside of airport shops then use Vietnam Airlines.
667,Joe E,5,"Flew 3 sectors internally with Vietnam Airlines - HAN/DAD, DAD/SGN and SGN/HAN. All flights departed on time utilising Airbus A321 aircraft<br>On line check in very simple and easy to use"
667,Chrissy204051,4,We flew with Vietnam Airlines for the first time and found the airline.  The on boarding was very efficient and the flight was on time.  The staff were helpful and happy to assist.  The snacks offered were fresh with a ham and salad roll offered with a cool drink.  The seats were comfortable and disembarking through both doors meant we were off the plane quickly.  Luggage was manage quickly also.  Would fly with them again.   Great for the short internal flights.
667,Keith,3,"This was a functional, cramped, typical 7 hour flight. The stewards hardly smiled - that’s not the passengers fault!<br>At least it was a Boeing 787 and there were plenty of toilets."
667,1shep,5,"Flew with Vietnam Airways on tour of Vietnam. Found them to be courteous, pleasant and efficient. Comfortable seats on every flight. The international flights were on Dreamliners and were not lacking. The food served on the international flights was well presented and a choice between Asian and western cuisine (the choices provided didn't run out, unlike a another certain national airline I have reviewed earlier). The domestic flights were mostly on time - this was where we incurred a 15 minute delay. The speed of boarding was certainly impressive."
668,goonting,4,i'm glad it's on time. for the 2:35PM departure from the busy SGN airport. Boarding a bus to the place was the challenging part because of the heat.
668,LostLuggageLuke,4,"The last few years have seen VN massively improve their product with the introduction of new long-haul planes and more accessible fares thanks to the emergence of low-cost competition in the region. If booked in advance, a Saigon - Hanoi flight can cost the same as on Jetstar or Vietjet but with the inclusion of a checked bag, seat selection, better legroom and complimentary food/drink. <br><br>Our domestic flight was originally scheduled as a new 787 Dreamliner, however this was changed almost immediately after booking to an older, smaller A321. Whilst not devastating for this short flight, I'd chosen the flight specifically to fly on one of their larger long-haul jets and enjoy the bigger seats and on-demand IFE. So a word of advice if travelling between Vietnam's two major cities; check which flights are operated by the 787 or A350 in order to get a vastly superior onboard product for the same price as on their standard short-haul aircraft which also operate the route."
668,Linda J,5,My husband and I travelled from Sydney to Saigon in November and couldn't fault the flight in any way. Comfortable seats and good in flight entertainment. Our flight left Sydney at 11:50am local time not long into the flight we were given lunch with two choices (beef or fish) which was nice. There is also plenty of water available. About two hours before landing we were given another meal (beef or chicken). Blankets and small pillows are supplied and the hostesses were very accomodating to people's needs. Would definitely fly with with Vietnam airways again.
668,Carpe-Diem3012,5,I often fly with Vietnam Airlines within Asia and to Europe.<br><br>Flights are usually comfortable and the crew members are always friendly.<br><br>I shall add that the food on this flight was overcooked. I had fish and my wife had beef. We finished them because we were hungry.
668,332dawn,5,"We flew Vietnam Airlines to Hanoi and return to London, also from Hanoi to Laos. The staff were very helpful, when our return flight to London was changed Vietnam Airlines arranged accommodation, transport and meals overnight in Hanoi straight away, and ensured we were well looked after. We experienced great customer support.<br><br>Check in, baggage reclaim and the flights were well organised. The on board meals were good. I would definitely fly with the airline again."
669,James O,4,"Very good airline. Professional and with new and spacious planes (unlike some other airlines). They made us wait longer than necessary on the bus from the gate to the plane and packed us tight as sardines - unncessary since they needed two busses anyway and the second one only had 20 or so people in it (as opposed to the 200 in the first one). Perhaps a managagement issue that should be resolved? Other than that, the service is much better than on VietJet or Viet Star."
669,Brian Peterson,4,"Have always flown with Vietnam Airlines and will continue to do so. The planes are clean, the cabin crew are unbelievable, the airline is always on time. Cannot fault this airline in any way."
669,jipteq,5,I recently reviewed this airline on my departure to Hanoi from Sydney and it was disappointing  turns out it was just one of those things because my return trip was fantastic I still got stuck behind the wing ie noisy however this plane was new much more comfortable than my previous flight and I had a entire row of seats so first sleep on a plane not in business class! Check in was easy as I chose online check in its much faster and seat choice is available! While coming home from a trip is always not the best at least this flight was good it was an hour late but the 8 plus hours passed quickly I will use this airline again as I will return to Hanoi for a longer period so it is still a good less expensive airline for people who want to travel on a budget
669,tdalto64,3,"We flew four times with Vietnam Airline during a recent holiday to Vietnam, all flights were all on time and baggage claim was always quick. Staff at the terminals were happy to help out and point you in the right direction. I would recommend using their app to complete a web checkin as it saves you time at the airport and allows you to select your seat. Flight staff on the return leg to Sydney were not very happy happy and smiles seemed to be forced, service was over quickly and the offer of a second drink after dinner on the late flight to Australia would have been appreciated."
669,Mon G,4,"I always use this airline whenever i fly from Vietnam to Singapore and so far it has not disappointed me. The ground crew and the flight crew was really accommodating and the most important thing is, i have never experienced Vietnam Airlines to be delayed."
670,santi puspayanti,4,"The meals are good, the staff are friendly, baggage claim are really fast, the seat and leg room is comfortable."
670,Mara J,5,"Not only did I fly internationally with this company, I also flew domestically in Vietnam. The company is extremely efficient in all the chaos and more than willing to help. Everyone went above and beyond when providing assistance. <br><br>Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh I could not fault the company at all. When we flew domestic from Ho Chi Minh to Hue our flight was cancelled while we sitting in it, due to the storms. It was extremely difficult to run to get our luggage to then go to the counter to rebook another flight when you have a friend who recently had a knee replacement. In saying this, once we booked a new flight (to Da Nang) passengers had already commenced boarding. So we had to re check our luggage in and we were escorted by a lovely Vietnam Airlines representative to security once again. The plane waited for us and a few other passengers that had to change flights. The other two domestic flights went smoothly. <br><br>When we got to the airport on our last day the representatives explained that our domestic flight was delayed. So they quickly booked us on another flight, while managing to keep us together.  This meant we were able to get our connecting international flight on time. <br><br>I have seen comments such as “be prepared for delays” etc. but at the end of the day if you have another flight to catch in my experience they assist you so you don’t miss it. <br><br>Thank you for your friendly service. It was appreciated."
670,RajeshPillai20,4,As usual excellent service both at checkin Desk as well as onboard. Food as usual was excellent. Airline is always on time and seen from a weekly day Business trip for 3 years while working in Vietnam. Never disappointed with Airlines
670,Viet-Quang N,5,"The business class of VN is great. Checkin was smooth with SkyPriority. Meals are stunning and wonderful. Attendants are professional (improved English!). Automated attendant voice instead of the real one, which is nice anyway. Bagging claims were fast at ICN. The only exception is the Immigration Officers at HAN. Really rude and unprofessional. Need to update IFE."
670,Norman L,4,"Took the very early Sunday morning flight to Hanoi, the airport was very busy.  We arrived at the airport an hour and a quarter prior to departure however due to the huge numbers of people travelling this proved to nearly be not be enough time.  We were still trying to get through security when the announcements for boarding were made.  just made the plane in time.  Flight took off in time was very smooth, took about two hours to arrival in Hanoi.  A snack and drinks were served on the plane.  The aircraft was a fairly new Airbus A321, all in all a very pleasant flight."
671,AlyHunter,5,"I won't deny some slight nervousness as I'd never flown with this airline before. This was a Dreamliner with good legroom, excellent service from all crews and included all food, drinks, entertainment, earphones, blanket, cushion. Food was tasty and the price superb. Don't hesitate if you have any doubts. Professional and well organised."
671,Andrew T,3,"Cabin service was reasonable, food quite good but no in flight entertainment working on the return journey of over 12 hours and no apology."
671,Larry M,4,"Quick turnaround for a visa run...efficient airline and check-in.  Main hassle at HAN was waiting forever for a visa, not airlines fault."
671,Sherly Y,4,"Singapore to Osaka with transit at HCMC. Overall a good flight for the price and transit time is quite reasonable. The flight was delayed twice (SGP-HCMC and KIX-HCMC leg) but the final arrival time is on time. Smooth journey, clean and spacious aircraft. The foods were decent. <br><br>Taking a star off for the absence of smile on the board. No greeting upon boarding and no warmth in the service. Some of the crew did smile on one-to-one interaction, set me wondering if being stoic is part of the image of the airline. <br><br>The best was a senior cabin attendant on VN659 (HCMC-SGP leg) who always smiled when serving the passengers and greeted us upon boarding. The worst was the crew on KIX-HCMC leg. They seems very busy and unprepared when distributing meals, and shouted at the passengers to sit down before the turbulance. <br><br>Will I take the flight again? Sure. The hospitality is not the best, but the service is still professional and the journey was pleasant."
671,michael s,5,What a great airline met on board with a smile. Given got towel free drinks. Service was so good and seats very nice with legroom <br>Crew always asking if you want another drink <br>Will fly again
672,Stephen F,5,Helpful.friendly. Informative during flight by crew.plane was clean.hosties professional. All flights on time. Price very reasonable.Great airline to travel with.
672,Bob S,5,"service and leg room were excellent, European counterparts can learn from this. food was reasonable and the areas in the airports were very quiet and well taken care off. the planes are clean, service is well. counters are friendly and service with a smile, such a relieve in this crowded world"
672,jipteq,3,This is my fourth trip with this airline and some things have changed suffice it to say I am not impressed with the 787 airliner however that aside the flight in general was fine although I feel like since my last flight on this airline it has dropped the ball a little.<br><br>I had changed my flight 3 times due to the incompetence of my travel agent and to the best of my knowledge my overall flight cost was similar to a business class ticket. So if I can give people any advice at all do not trust that your travel agent knows enough to make your travel easy check your self especially tourist visa length this being why I changed my ticket so many times.<br> As I said flight was fine however at 2 k it should have been better do your homework people it will save you a lot both financially and with sanity
672,highbar,3,"Flight on time,plane was old and a bit worn inside. Staff ok. Perfunctory....they didn't smile much, served us all just a bottle of water then on not 1, but 2, flights within Vietnam brought trays of food back to the galley and ate while we sat with water for almost an hour and a half.  For the prices they should offer more choices to drink! Flight attendant stepped on my foot with no apology as he was hurrying to go and eat the meal he was carrying to the back galley! Would rather fly Dragon Cathay Pacific or ANA."
672,stuart137,5,"Great flight, great service, great food. Bit of a hidden gem! I would recommend this airline.<br><br>This review is one of a few as we had multiple trips with Vietnam Airlines during our little SE Asia tour."
673,stuart137,5,"Great flight, great service, great food. Bit of a hidden gem! I would recommend this airline.<br><br>This review is one of a few as we had multiple trips with Vietnam Airlines during our little SE Asia tour."
673,stuart137,5,"After a 7hr 45min layover at Ho Chi Minh we had a 13hr flight home to London. Vietnam Airlines were fantastic. Food and service was great. We were on a B787 Dreamliner so it was very comfortable and modern. The only downside.....the IFE didn't work, at all, all the way home. Had it been a daytime flight I think there would have been an issue on board, but as it was a night flight everyone just went to sleep so it wasn't the end of the world. That being said, i would still definitely recommend Vietnam Airlines. This review is one of a few as we had multiple trips with Vietnam Airlines during our little SE Asia tour."
673,daisytealover,5,"Great full fledged airline that is definitely value for money - comfort, good food and entertainment onboard. You'll have a pleasant trip as long as you choose connecting flights with 2-3h of transit time :)"
673,Ken B,5,"Flew on a 787 Dreamliner to Vietnam. This was a pleasant flight, service was good and friendly,  food was good for airline food. Also had 5 internal flights as well as return flight.<br>No problems with check-in and pkanes left on time."
673,WalkingPoint,4,"A low cost, efficient airline. Cabin Crew were well trained and professional. Nice arrival times into Japan."
674,Lukas L,4,"Good service with nice planes and a lot of connections to Vietnam. Food was ok, service was very good, Often very new planes (e.g. A350)."
674,jbowers22,5,So friendly and hospitable and good meal for such a short trip.  The drinks and food was quite good and the plane was clean.
674,calpar22,3,"Check in process was straight forward, however I wouldn't expect it to be too gruelling at 5:30am.<br>We boarded late, and the flight left late, this would've bothered us if we'd had somewhere to go on the other end but we didn't therefore it made little difference. Also it's not always the airline that's to blame for poor punctuality.<br>Service is as expected, flight was an hour and a bit so no food, complementary bottle of water on offer along with a wipe. Plane was tiny and quite run down but had quite a lot of let room which was a plus. <br>The flight ended with a pretty suspect landing, but we got there in one piece."
674,Graziella D,5,"I must admit, I had low expectations before flying with Vietnam Airlines but as soon as I stepped into the place, I was rather impressed. The crew was polite, helpful and well-dressed. The food was simply delicious and the flight was superb. I've chose Vietnam Airlines each time I had to fly internally within Vietnam."
674,Sharron C,1,Well the flight over from Oz was really good but the flight back after charging us an extra $300.01 each to fly back home. Was not impressed and will not fly with them again. We altered our internal flights and paid for them! When we got to Ho Chi Min for our flight back home they said we changed our itinerary! Yes we did and paid for that! So the only way for us to fly home was to pay a further $300.01 to do so!! You can’t argue with them on the protocols and they have no understanding of the issues. Never again. No offers of refunds provided.
675,Stingrui11,4,"Travelled on the new Vietnam airlines Dreamliner business class for the first time round due to a flight deal and was delighted with the travel. Service and food was good and the seat itself was excellent for the price paid. Only slight complaint was the lack of variety in the entertainment system, but for the same price, I'll take this flight again."
675,Triskellion,5,"We had not flown with this airline before, but we will definitely use them again when we are in this area.<br>We had flights from Bangkok to Hanoi, Hanoi to Da Nang and back, booking online was very easy and straightforward.<br>When I booked there was very little difference between standard and business class so we went for business class on all legs, the seating and service was great and the Vietnam air lounges were excellent, when we arrived in Hanoi we even had our own private shuttle from the plane to the terminal! <br>We booked many months prior to travel and there were a couple of minor changes to times which we were informed about by e mail, and they asked to confirm the changes were acceptable, I always got a personal response within 10 minutes to my confirmation which was impressive. We could only book our seats to Da Nang and back at check in, but I couldnt do it on line for some reason so I e mailed them to explain and within 5 minutes they sent me a copy of the seating layout with the free seats and they reserved them for us, very good service."
675,Maya O,1,"Very very disappointing service. <br>Booked a flight to phu quoc a week ago, was schedualed to land there at 10:40. When I arrived at the airport I was told it was delayed to 11:55.  Then I saw was there was a flight on 10:55. When asking the representatives in the airport why am I not on that flight, I was given two different reasons:<br>1. My bags had not been sent and “there is no time now”. <br>2. There is no room. <br>It seems to me that people’s time and money are of very little regard to them."
675,R-JayEm,4,"Flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh was delayed, so did the transfer from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang. Minimal in flight entertainment and food service was delayed as well. Service staff were friendly, however, I would have preferred if they offered some drinks and snacks prior to serving the meal as it took quite a while for the food to get to us sitting in the middle of the plane, more so for those seated at the back."
675,Dolores W,3,"On tour with APT (who have no control on the Airlines) and due to fly from Hanoi to Ho Chi Min at 4.15pm.  On the way from Halong Bay to Hanoi we were advised that there was a delay and our flight would now be leaving at 5pm.  By the time we got to the airport the flight had again been delayed to 7pm and finally the delay was then stretched out to 7.30pm and the flight number we travelled on had been altered.  No real explanation.  We arrived in Ho Chi Min too late for events organised by APT, who I must say went out of their way to make things right for us.  We felt that we were bumped from one flight to another to another.  We went from 253 to 259 in our flight number.  After 2 1/2 hour coach ride the last thing we wanted was a three hour delay."
676,Antinmelb,3,"I'm going to be specific so i hope the airline reads this.<br><br>we booked Business Class from Melbourne to Paris, 7 of us as the price was excellent. mostly OK with the space, service and meals were OK, not sumptuous. On all flights something was not working with either the seat,(one of us moving 3 times in one flight) the monitor or the sink in the bathroom would not empty, you need to maintain the facilities we the customers are paying for that. <br><br>So the specific is the flight above VN10 from Paris to Ho Chi Mihn. Wednesday October 18 Seat 2K. So the hostess may not be too good with English, but I do expect a bit more enthusiasm. ""what would you like to order"" could i start with a menu please.  so i was last to order, ""there is no more Beef"" but the crew member in the seat nearby got the beef meal! (yes I'm observant)<br>I had to ask twice for more wine and water, during the meal service, got poured a red when I'm drinking white. call bell didn't work so i had to wave (usually gets them off side with you).<br>the pecan Ice cream was nice ""wave"" I ask would i be able to have another please, Looks across the isle and goes off. 15 minutes later ""none left""  5 rows back seemed to have here attention. oh well.<br>same flight other side of the plane some of my fellow travellers were fussed over so this was ....one flight attendant, so i can't judge the whole lot on one, thats why I'm being specific, i didn't get her name."
676,Ernest G,3,"The aircraft model is A321 but the interior of the plane is old with no inflight entertainment system.. other than this, the food is average, nothing to rave about.. the only good thing is the pricing which is attractive as compared to budget airlines.."
676,JJGA1,5,"We where very positively surprised with Vietnam Airlines and would definitely fly with them again. The International Fight was very good and so was the national part we do fly regularly and do normally when flying to europa fly with Qatar or Emirates, but after this surprising good experience and our awesome time in Hoi An. (Maison Vy &amp; Hotel Lasenta are the best two Hotels in Town) we are thinking for our next Holiday to Europa to make a stop over in Vietnam. It will be Hoi An again staying at Hotel Lasenta and eat as many meals as possible at the restaurants Cargo, Morning Gory 1&amp;2 and Vy's Market) and we may need some new cloth with eating and eating ;-) you need a tailor best address in Vietnam is Yaly Couture for us and OCHI for the younger once)"
676,naomiedwards2013,3,"This was the first time flying business class and to be honest we were expecting a little bit more class than what it actually had.  The flat beds were a bonus of course but the layout is a little strange and my husband and I had to actually request that we were seated next to each other on every occasion.  (We had a lay over in Vietnam for one night, and then flew business class with Air Asia on to France).  The staff had very limited English which led to a few miscommunications, I honestly thought for the money we paid, we should have at least been able to communicate properly with the staff).  Having said that the staff were friendly and not bothersome at all.  You did have to buzz if you wanted an extra drink or something, they did not routinely walk around offering anything.  The meals were very good, although they ran out of things sometimes so there were limited options available at times.  Again, I thought for what we paid we would have had more menu options.  Overall, if you only want to fly business class so that you can lie down then you will be happy,  If you want extras, maybe not so.  Limited movie choices (most of them in Vietnamese) with only 2 recent movies made for a pretty long flight,"
676,Coryy20,5,I had the option of booking the other airline serving this route which I think was vietjet..it was much cheaper than Vietnam airlines but from reviews I read I opted for this airline and was so glad I did because whilst sitting at both Hanoi and saigon airport I heard on more than one occasion flights cancelled or delayed for viejet..<br><br>The check in  counter staff ..the airhostesses were all very pleasant just like the rest of Vietnam people..such friendly people. I was surprised that we got meal on a 2 hours flight ..this was a pleasant surprise. What impressed me was ....well scared me a bit too ..was when I looked out the window and saw the entire sky deep blue everything was blue and a minute before it was normal when I looked outside. I called the air stwrd and asked what was happening and then he said the airplane has built in sun and heat shade in the windows as their isn't a pull down shade... I have been on over 20 different airlines and have never seen such...really cool.. then he showed me the button by the window to press if I want the light back in the plane.. when pressed the window was no longer blue and in came the brightness of the sun.. cool technology Vietnam airlines.<br><br>The flight was on time ...Smooth and very enjoyable. Would definitely fly with you and recommend also.
677,nlhAustralia,5,"We have flown from Sydney to Frankfurt and return with Vietnam Airlines.  The planes, seats, staff and food is good.<br><br>However, the Lotus Lounge food in Saigon is terrible.  The food that should be hot is cold and things like drinks, yoghurts etc are warm!  The range of food is the worst we have seen in any Business Class lounge.  Vietnam Airlines need to address this situation if they want to attract more  customers"
677,Grantman66,5,"I've actually flown on Vietnam airlines a number of times and in fact their codeshare with Cathy is what led to me using Cathy for my overseas flights.  Vietnam airlines are quite clean, very efficient, staffed well and the service is excellent.  The cost to fly on them is good too.  i'v flown them back and forth from Hong Kong to SGN/HAN and in country; to Phu Bai (Hue), Danang, Qui Nhon, Pleiku, etc.  I would strongly recommend Vietnam airlines to any one.  Their first/business section is nice as well although for the short flights is really configured about the same as most small regional airlines, A 320/A 321."
677,AgerKJ,4,"was very pleasantly surprised by Vietnam Airlines - travelling with a tour group &amp; use of local airlines can be hit &amp; miss. Vietnam airlines my best experience yt - comfortable spacious seats (for economy) Good in flight entertainment, pleasant crew, average food but helpful to provide snacks etc - would definitely travel with them again"
677,Tony C,4,"Efficient operation.  Food ok.  Good service.  Small plane and tight accommodations, but flying economy.  Staff attentive and accommodating.  Flow this airline within the country of Vietnam and quite acceptable and on schedule."
677,voirol,5,"Vietnam airlines was first a pleasant surprise, and now brand new aircraft, great cabin service, and competitive prices make it a reliable choice."
678,Zayar N,4,"We took two way flight from Singapore to Hanoi. Compared to jetstar/scoot or other budget airlines, I think every penny worth it. All the flight attendants were willing to serve you with smile and very accommodating. An amazing part is the food provided. Before lunch, we're offered a small package of peanuts and drinks. Variety of drinks (juices,beer,wines,soft drinks) on board. We're delighted with the lunch and had a heavy tummies. Overall, the experience was satisfying and good job, VA!"
678,BillericayBaz,4,Took five flights over three weeks - two long haul  between UK and Vietnam and three shorter ones (to/from Vientiane and from Hue to HCMC). All ran to time. Food was fine - seats comfortable. Additional blankets etc were provided if required. Entertainment system had a good selection of films/TV/Music/Games. And good value.
678,Santa1102,5,"flight from Yangon-Hanoi and Hanoi-Frankfurt. Both flights were good, crew was nice, planes were in both cases modern and i had a lot of space."
678,Rpkak,5,"Flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh then on to Da Nang and return. Very good service all the way even the flight Ho Chi Minh to Sydney which was full. Seats slightly smaller than what we are used to but still comfortable. The check-in people were extremely helpful and so friendly especially the girls in Da Nang on the return flight who booked everything back to New Zealand , boarding passes and bags ensuring hassle free connections. Would recommend as an airline we will definitely fly again"
678,Karina_Jpn,4,"Bangkok-2 hrs-Hanoi-5 hrs-Tokyo<br>After flying low cost arilines for a week (5 legs in total), it was a relief to finaly fly in a normal fare major airline, with major inflight service.  Maybe it was the difference of the fare, but I felt that I was finally being treated as a customer and not as a potential drink, food and duty free shop goods buyer with no posibility of escaping them. <br>The flight attendants were nice and attentive all the time and they did a great job on serving the dinner on a 2 hrs flight."
679,Sonnycolin,4,We booked a flight for 190 euro (No where cheaper to find) from Dalat to da nang. The airplane was small. Made a lot of noise (more than average). Staff was great though.
679,egsgrig,1,"Take my word for it, Vietnam airlines has the worst customer service and communication skills of any airliner I have EVER flown! They are unreliable and unwilling to accommodate in a reasonable fashion even when they are at fault. <br>My story: my husband and I live in Seoul, Korea and we flew to Cambodia for vacation. Three days into our vacation, they emailed us stating that they had cancelled our flight and the only accommodation that they would offer was a flight FOUR DAYS LATER which would cause us to miss our connection in Ho Chi Min City. We tried contacting them on many occasions through many avenues and they shifted the blame or did not respond every time. All that we asked for was a refund of our money and they refused. We lost money, had to cut our vacation short, travel to another airport, and purchase new more expensive tickets last minute. <br>Then in Ho Chi Minh City, they refused to give us our connecting tickets and Vietnam Airlines made us wait for over 4 HOURS before they would finally give us our tickets. The attendants were very rude and spoke no English and there was no one that spoke English or Korean to help us. <br>I will not fly with Vietnam Airlines again and neither should you unless you are willing to have your flight cancelled last minute and be out a lot of money."
679,Razib_Mahbubul,5,i received the notification over email as reminder and details of the flight. Good online check-in system. Nice helpful staff in arranging the boarding. Flight was on-time and very comfortable seats. good food and service. Landing was a bit rough but okay. the baggage right on time no delay. So far great first experience!!
679,Ian W,5,"Well, what can I say. Travelling Business Class has spoilt it for my wife and I for all future flights. It is amazing. Right from check in, the lounge and the flight, all seamless and extremely enjoyable. Luckily for us, when I booked this flight many months ago, there was a special where business was only $40 AUD extra for this domestic flight. As we had a 4 hour stop over in Ho Chi Minh City, I thought it would be worthwhile. It was. The lounge is a lot more comfortable than just sitting around in the airport and was straight across from our boarding gate. And I could check our baggage in as soon as we got there and head straight to the lounge, no waiting around for check in to open.<br>The flight itself was also great. Very large and comfortable seats, drink and cold towel when we sat down, delicious food with real cutlery, everything was great. Highly recommend doing it, if only once. Thank you Vietnam Airlines."
679,1avdtraveler,5,Not one to fly business but we had the opportunity offered by Vietnam Airlines at a discount. We fully enjoyed the experience. Great seats and phenomenal service. Greeted with champagne from before take off and treated and taken care off superbly.  Would definitely recommend taking business class with them. Old newspapers though. A week old.
680,Roz W,5,"Had not heard of this airline before but was very pleased by the service. Comfortable long haul and internal flights (we took 4 flights with them in total) <br>Smoothest flight ever on the way back - Hanoi to LHR. Good entertainment system available, blankets and pillows."
680,journey960,4,While the  Danang  Tokyo flight was comfortable  the return trip from Osaka was  first classs. Business class on the 380 aircraft  provides with comfort  and privacy and  menu  rates highly  but this depends on the embarkation point . Leaving Osaka  means catering is prepared in Osaka.. Some glitches  with on  flight enetrtainment occured but did not affaect the overall experience.
680,peterM3513OQ,4,"Had not flown them before so was not sure what to expect. A350 and had 3 seats to myself. Very comfortable. Inflight screen good, screening content ok. Did not eat, but looked nice enough. Managed some rest and arrived on time. If I have to fault something, the cabin was rather warm, bordering on uncomfortable, but it was not a major issue."
680,Warby,5,The flight was delayed by 15 minutes but overall excellent. From check in to bag collection in Singapore everything was excellent
680,Michael C,5,Though just a quick flight to Da Nang from Hanoi i was reluctant to book with these guys.<br>Excellent flight with lovely service before and during flight. FREE water! Refreshment towel and the food/snacks cheap and tasty. Lovely flight attendants.
681,legh d,4,"Check in was quick and efficiently processed, meals and service were as good as any other airline and the seats on their new dreamliner was as comfortable as you can get in economy. My only complaint was that if you are seated behind the engines the noise on the new dreamliners is far worse than we were expecting, especially as this is supposed to eb a quiter airplane. Overall a one hop 12 hour flight to London from Hanoi at a reasonable price was really good value. I won't hesitate to fly with them again but next time will try and get seats in front of the engines."
681,Darren H,3,Not a lot of leg room. Also not a lot of entertainment (moves/games). Would recommend it short flight. Good was ok and staff were good on a hole.would not like to travel international with them again.
681,Daniel D,5,"Quick and easy check-ins always. I have flown with Vietnam Airlines 12 times in the past four weeks and each time the service I receive is great. No fuss and easy boarding. <br><br>As someone who travels a lot for pleasure and work as an expat chef, I am always satisfied beyond measure with this airline and when I have friends visiting from other countries I always recommend they fly Vietnam Airlines instead of a budget airline.<br><br>There has been some extreme turbulence a few times and the crew were quick to retrieve the food trays and hot coffees from me and return them when the flight was stable again.<br><br>The seats are always great and the stewards know how to read someone’s comfort or discomfort quite well.<br><br>I am always happy to use Vietnam Airlines and enjoy that I have been successful with even my last minute bookings to be accommodated in the fashion I enjoy.<br><br>I just wish Vietnam Airlines flew direct to Canada where I am from instead of using a partner airline with lower customer service and terrible seats."
681,Marzena P,3,"Convenient flight to cover distance from Hue to Hanoi. The lounge in Hue surprises as there are some unexpected shops and restaurants even though the airport is very small. <br><br>It was only 1:15h flight so there was no food service and only water is provided. <br><br>The stuff is indifferent, passes through the plane as there were no passengers, you need to shout if you want to have your empty water bottle taken. <br><br>Generally service very average, but for short flight it's not really important. <br><br>There was no delay which is most important. <br><br>Luggage was handled nicely."
681,Mitchell-Family-01,4,"My wife and I have recently returned from Vietnam flying with Vietnam Airlines from Melbourne into Ho Chi Minh City.  We also travelled domestically to Hanoi and Da Nang with the airline, as well as into Cambodia.<br><br>The long haul flights to Ho Chi Minh and return to Melbourne were quite good.  We travelled in the Dreamliner 787, the newest addition to the fleet.  We also travelled in the 787 leg from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi.  The food and drink service was adequate on the long haul flights. Just be mindful that for short domestic flights there are no meal services just a bottle of water. The in-house movie selection could be expanded upon and updated to include latest movies.<br><br>The majority of flights took off on time except for one where we were apparently waiting for a connecting flight from Cambodia that was running late into Ho Chi Minh.   <br><br>Overall we were quite satisfied with the Vietnam Airlines overall."
682,RDuxburyinfo,2,They are always late!   I left 2 1/2 hours between my connecting flight and missed my connection. Bummer.
682,Warby,4,Check in and boarding were quick and efficient. Staff were helpful and friendly. Meal served was okay with soft drinks (normal coke or water)<br><br>Flight arrived on time and bags were very quick
682,Wantok88,5,the flight left on time and the service was excellence. The fish served was fantastic. Was really surprised with ample leg room on the Airbus 321. great flight.
682,MickeyMouse179,2,"We booked our flights with Vietnam Airlines through a travel agent and had to change from International to a Domestic flight with a 95 minute gap. Our bags took a long time to get to the carousel and we had to walk to the Domestic terminal. The signage was terrible and we had to try each counter before we found the correct one only to face a huge line to check in. We asked one of the airline employees who had no idea and told us to join the line. We went to the ticket counter only to be told that the flight was now closed and had no seats available. We explained that we were booked on the flight and eventually convinced them that we needed to get on that flight as there were no more seats available that day. The language barrier didn't help and we were dealing with young people who seemed to have no motivation. Eventually they allowed us on the flight, which by the way was nowhere near full, but had to leave our bags behind. One saving grace was that the bags did turn up that night after several hours.<br>We have flown on International flights many times but have never had this problem before. The delays with late baggage collection and not enough time between flights falls completely with the airline."
682,bollingerSydney,3,"... and we focus on service. The cabin crew did their job, but only going through the motion. It is an 8 hour trip and you are well advised to stop at Burger King before boarding. The food was the worse I have ever been served on a plane. Serving hot food on a plane is obviously a difficult undertaking, but if you take the trouble, than at least make it eatable. Will I fly Vietnam Airlines again? Highly unlikely!"
683,thuqquynh,5,"Ms. Le Phuong (!?) was a great and attentive flight attendant. Food was nice, esp the bread. Very personalized I would say."
683,Sue M,4,"We flew with Vietnam airlines from London Heathrow  to Hanoi, had 2 internal flights Hanoi-Hue and Danang-Ho Chi Minh, and returned to London from Ho Chi Minh.    All flights left on time or early and arrived on time or early and check in was efficient.  All flights were comfortable.   The inflight service, particularly on the London flights, was excellent.   We had no complaints.   There was a reasonably good selection of movies, although a few more newer ones would have been appreciated.   The food on the outbound flight from London was very good; the food on the return flight, obviously prepared in Ho Chi Minh,did not match in terms of quality and selection, and was not really to our European tastes; they could improve the European choice.   But overall, a very good airline and I would definitely fly with them again.   And they fly direct flights in and out of London!! :)"
683,Sonya C,1,"I would recommend that you do not fly Vietnam Airlines. I was flying domestically between Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh and accidentally put my husbands middle name  on the airline ticket when it did not appear on his passport.<br>Even though my husband had several other forms of identification with his middle name on it, they said that because I had made a mistake we would have to pay for the ticket again!!! Same seat at double the price and refused to refund the original ticket!<br>When I asked them why my husbands passport is even an issue as this is a domestic flight and he doesn't even need a passport, they stated it is just the airlines policy. When I asked why they couldn't  just amend my husbands ticket, they had no real reason- just a cash grab by this disgraceful airline. <br>Unfortunately, this experience left a very bad taste in my mouth at the end of our holiday.  :("
683,DewaParis,1,"To be fair, we didn't take the flight finally because the staffs (who handled our case) for this company were completely useless.<br>We only wanted some further information and we were turned away rudely. The staff working for the helpdesk at HANOI airport should attend extensive training on how to actually deal with customers. I know they were probably there just to be beautiful (and ""pistoné"") but please have some dignity (to quit!!!) and a little bit of brain cells. <br>They can not answer simple questions let alone direct us who can actually answers those Non-Einstein-brain-cells-requirements questions.<br>I would love to give 0 (Yes Zero) point for this airlines but then again.. 1 (One) is so pitiful which they probably deserved."
683,LFC_ASR,3,Considering this was just a 1 hour flight getting a sandwich and water on a small atr 70 turbojet plane was ok. Would have loved some coffee<br><br>Seats comfortable too<br>Remember these planes have a 2 + 2 seating configuration. So you always have an aisle or a window seat!
684,Jule0902,5,"Travelled as a group of girls, staff at airport were very helpful. Crew on the flight were pleasant and nothing was too much trouble, drinks brought around and passengers could go to the back of the plane to ask for extra or for snacks.<br><br>Would use again."
684,Twomeke007,3,"It's the preferred domestic airline in Vietnam but has a lot of work to do. Not always running on time so important to make sure you plan ahead if catching international flights or give yourself time to make meetings.<br><br>The food was atrocious, recommend bringing your own. The staff are friendly and helpful.<br><br>Seat size is narrow, built more for locals not westerners."
684,davidC5632EO,4,"The staff on Vietnam Airlines are very friendly. Near new plane being a Dreamliner 787. Seating good but the standard 3x3x3 seating is not the best arrangement but most airlines are setting up their 787 in this way. Food satisfactory, flights on time easy boarding with them calling the seat numbers. The only real fault is that we were on the plane for about an hour &amp; a half before any drink was served. They served food etc then we had to wait longer for the next cart to serve a drink. After leaving a hot country and getting on a plane they should hand out a small bottle of water before even taking off. I noticed people asking for a drink and they were told to wait. Vietnam Airlines you need to change this. Otherwise a nice flight."
684,ZINNIA21,5,We found our flight from Phu Quoc to HCM had been delayed more than an hour when we arrived at the airport in Phu Quoc .  Worryingly we only had just enough time to connect to fly to Siem Reap with our original flight time . The ground staff in Phu Quoc were very reassuring took our details and said there would be a Vietnam Airlines staff member waiting for us in HCM to make sure we caught our international flight and this is exactly what happened . Well done Vietnam Airlines a very professional service .
684,1avdtraveler,5,This is our second flight with Vietnam Airlines and I must say they do a phenomenal job at taking care of their customers. We were treated with respect and although the boarding of the plane was delayed a bit we took off without any problems.
685,lisaberrell,5,My husband and I recently flew with Vietnam airlines on a 9 hour flight. Normally I dread these long flights but Vietnam airlines made it bearable. The staff were great from check in through to the friendly hosties. Food and entertainment were both great also! We normally fly Jetstar to save a bit of cash but I'm so glad we chose to fly with Vietnam airlines this trip. Would fly with them again any day 👍
685,graham t,3,"OK but many faults.  Check in with luggage forwarded on was efficient. The lounge in Hanoi was bad with nothing to drink but tea/coffee, water, pop or beer and no service to speak of.. It was an aging aircraft but everything at my seat worked.  The cabin was too hot.  The service was cursory at best and entertainment non-existent.  The food was OK but the drink selection was poor with only one absolutely terrible wine.  The toilet was smelly and therefore I assume not regularly cleaned."
685,graham t,4,"A good airline on international flights.  All was good and efficient, priority passes and luggage worked well.  Cabin service was good but sometimes language became an issue, though not serious.  Two little things, but I expect better in business; no malt whisky and despite serving lots of pastries for breakfast, no jam!<br><br>Use Vietnem they are way way better than many."
685,Andrew Q,2,"I didn't enjoy this flight to much, I felt cramped in economy, one of the staff was a little rude when I didn't sit my backrest quick enough, cause I was half asleep, The plane in general Boeing 787  , was a pretty smooth flight , on the way home I upgraded to premium economy which was a lot better more room etc, I wouldn't fly this airline again as my pregnant wife took over an hour to get a bottle of water from one of the flight attendants, and I felt that they were more interested In catering for the Vietnamese passengers, I had my call bell on and they served every Vietnamese passenger , I ended up cancelling the call bell and going to sleep. Qantas and Virgin Australia all the way,"
685,MaxineP958,4,"I like this airline, they are efficient, provide good friendly service and  have dependable flight times.  We flew both Vietjet and Vietnam Airlines through-out Vietnam and while Vietjet offers a much reduced rate then Vietnam Airline, Vietnam Airline leaves on time, has few if any flight time / Boarding Gate Changes.  The only negative, I do feel their pricing is a little high and would like to see this be a little bit more competitive.  And as for all internal airline flights, they should consider offering tourist ( who can show an international ticket )  the same luggage weight 30kg as current 20kg allowance, means you have to watch what you buy and limit purchases while taking domestic flights.  Having the same luggage allowance would encourage travellers to buy more and help the economy somewhat."
686,Sarah f,2,"eSiem Reap to London via Ho Chi Ming, Before checking in in at Siem reap, we asked if we could upgrade, we were told it cannot be done till we get to ho Chi ming I was travelling with my partner and they gave us different seat, which we complained about in Ho chi ming, Ground staff was very rude, finally we were sitted together<br>During the 12:30hrs filght , I was starving and asked for snacks, i was told there was none<br>Eventually, my husband called an attendant who brought noodles"
686,Laurentiu N,5,Very good food provided on board and clean airplane. <br>Flight attendant were very friendly and helpful.<br>Plenty leg room and comfortable seats.
686,1avdtraveler,5,"They took off on time. Did a great job boarding even though we boarded via a bus and onto the tarmac.  On board, the service e was great with a very good meal and your choice of drinks included. During flight anything you needed they provided. Including blankets free of charge."
686,skrblik2016,5,"Small plane, short flight. Cean plane, very good service, real business class seats for shore flight. Very good and nice selection of meats, french wine (we had full bottle:-) ). Much better than meny of european airlines."
686,Raymond Tan,2,"Aircraft was new, but sad to say the inflight services and food was not up to standard. I complained that the touch screen was not working well and all the flight attendant could muster up was oh there is still a controller without even finding out what's wrong.<br><br>Its the attitude that puts me off."
687,Mike K,4,"I travel London - Sydney several times a year. Flew Business LHR to Hanoi on the 787. Food, wine and service were all excellent. The IFE content, while not up to Emirates was perfectly adequate. Flew business from Hanoi to Saigon ~2 hour flight - full service with food and wine. Again excellent. My flight from Saigon to Sydney was on the 787, same comfort but the crew on this sector were less personable. NB these flights usually take longer as they go via Hanoi and Saigon. This is an excellent airline. If travel time is less important to you. For the price, comfort and safety would definitely fly with them again."
687,Christina M,5,"My first time taking Vietnam airlines. Impressive: good foods, services, clean, organise, on time and transit tour is an additional service that no other airline offering.<br>Improvement: Only one little thing to improve the inflight entertainment system audio doesn't work for one of the seat and the movies is not as new.<br>Overall: near perfect journey, pleasant and <br>will definitely go with VN again."
687,Vanderhessan,5,"I fly to Hanoi from Gatwick and I couldn't believe it amazing service the friendliest staff and the food was exceptional serving what actually felt a fresh vietnimese food really good<br>.I'm very tall at 6""6 and was given free leg room."
687,cirellone,4,Surprised by the comfort and good service of this airline. Best of Vietnam. I will fly again doubtless .
687,Brian L,2,"Booked a flight from Melbourne to Nha Trang, including a 3 hour stopover in Ho Chi Minh City for my wife and I through VN airlines.<br><br>They change my flight schedule on 2 occasions shortly after purchasing my ticket, the second flight change reducing my stopover time to only 1 hour, and also including an email from VN Airlines ask me to change to a 5am flight the next morning with an offer to pay for 1 night accommodation in Ho Chi Minh City, which i decline as I have already booked accommodation at my destination (5-star resort at $350/night). <br>I am also very concerned as I am transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight which requires me to clear customs, collect my bags and then check in again.<br><br>VN Airlines leave my schedule as is and advise that they will have staff on arrival to assist with my transfer. When i arrive VN airlines take almost 1 hour just to unload our luggage - The staff member on the ground who was supposed to assist is glued to her phone texting the entire time. Once we have our bags she leads us to the domestic terminal, tells us we've missed our flight, shrugs our shoulders and then walks off, forcing us to stay 1 night at an old, run-down hotel (couldn't even sleep due to the obscenely loud noises coming from the pipes in the walls) and forfeit the 1st night's accommodation at our destination.<br><br>I've attempted to contact their customer service line for compensation for weeks now, as well as included all my supporting documentation (emails, boarding passes etc.). Each time I do their response is always words to the effect of ""someone will get back to you"", and then I never heard back.<br><br>Completely disgusting."
688,stillmind,5,"On my recent trip to Europe to visit relatives, friends and see some of the sights I stumbled across Vietnam Airline's business class deal flying via Ho Chi Mhin City to Paris and return. I had been looking for a premium economy fare with all the other airlines but when I saw the deal with Vietnam Air I rang the agent in Sydney to make sure it was real. I can tell you now that the next time  I go to Europe it will be with this airline. I'll say right up front that with this fare the lay-overs in Ho Chi Minh City were long but the six hour wait on the way over suits me as I prefer to get off the plane, stretch out and in the business class lounge have a shower and revive with some food and wine.<br>On the return leg the layover is a full day but and this is a BIG but, Vietnam Air throw in at no extra charge, transfers to a great hotel for the day with full use of all it's facilities, including a huge room, meal vouchers to use in the hotel's excellent restaurant and a city tour with a guide.<br>The flight from Sydney was on the new Boeing Dreamliner and sitting up the front was a marvellous experience. The leg to Paris was a new Airbus A350, again up the front with all the great service, meals and drinks thrown in. A full flat bad in your own pod is something to write home about. The return flight from Paris was on Air France (partner airline) on a Boeing 777 and again the aircraft, the service and the flat bed was fantastic.<br>Flying into Paris was a new experience for me but it worked out great as Charles De Gaulle airport is linked by rail to Lille where I caught the Eurostar to St Pancras in London which meant I didn't have to go anywhere near the dreaded Heathrow.<br>I believe Vietnam Air are offering these lower priced fares to encourage more tourism. Well, they won me.<br>PS I paid for my fare and I swear this review was not solicited from from anyone."
688,DeeJay78,4,First time with Vietnam Airlines . Vacation in Vietnam on the return leg . Stop over in Saigon was very efficient .<br>Excellent configuration 1-2-1 .Service friendly . Thoroughly pleasant experience
688,Shimnik,5,"If it is possible, I would have added more movies to the entertainment list. The boarding was fast, the flight was safe, leg room is not so big, the food was great (dinner and breakfast)."
688,John H,5,"What a great flight! The legroom was excellent, the service was great and, although there was no alcoholic beverages, they managed to feed and water us for free during the short trip (about and hour and and a quarter) to Siem Reap.  The food was also very good."
688,DollyBirdScotland,5,"Like this airline a lot. Friendly service, nice meals and snacks, efficient check-in, boarding and luggage collection. Would seriously consider this airline for long haul trips based on this experience."
689,BillHLondon,5,"I flew business class London - Sydney round trip, with a 22 hour stopover in Hanoi on the way out and a 4 hour transfer on the way back. Overall, I was impressed with Vietnam Airlines and the fare I got was really good value and all four sectors were in a 787 Dreamliner. The seat, which folds into a lie-flat bed, is comfortable enough, but the pod is a bit tight for a well built 6'2"" like me. Check-in was efficient and speedy. The service was courteous and attentive throughout.  The food was good.  The champagne is Piper Heidsieck Monopole Blue Top and the wines .. all French, two reds and two whites .. were well chosen for drinking at altitude.  I didn't use the inflight entertainment, so I can't comment on that.<br><br>On the 22 hour stopover on the way out, the airline gives business class passengers a 4 star hotel, lunch, a short city tour and an early dinner in a local restaurant before returning you to the airport, all of which is great if you haven't been to Hanoi before. Be sure to book this with the airline before you travel, otherwise you won't get it."
689,PNalpha,2,The Vietnam air Line staff are not friendly  neither on the ground nor on board.<br>The services and relationship are poor.<br>I didn't like flying VN.<br>AirFrance from Ho Chi Minh was much  more better.
689,shar g,5,"We found the flight to be on time, the staff efficient and pleasant, the added extra's of free water and wet cloth were nice surprises."
689,Geoff333_13,4,I was impressed with this airline and my son who had travelled from London on Vietnam Airlines and was flying on to Sydney from Vietnam was also impressed with their service. The staff were helpful and friendly and the pilot provided information throughout the flight.
689,Mrs Kweh,1,"We are a group of 6 friends from Singapore and we will be visiting Vietnam in the month of Dec 2017 for a good 10days.<br>I have done the air ticket booking at the domestic flight from Ho Chin Ming to Phu Quoc on the 4th Sept. At the end of the check out for payment during the booking completion I did not see baggage inclusiveness info and hence I went back into the website to pay extra for the baggage fee.<br>Upon receiving the E-tickets, I then saw that baggage was actually included in the original booking so I have overpaid to the airline for the unnecessary baggage fee amounting to SGD95.00 for 2 x baggage fee. I then email to them asking for a refund but however I got rejected for this matter despite after several request.<br>I have since escalate to the Vietnam tourism department to help me with this matter in order to get a proper resolve in this unpleasant issue but also not getting any respond from them till date.<br>We have never been to Vietnam, this would be our very first time on their land and I certainly hope this will not end here."
690,Barry D,5,"A while back I came back from Hanoi, Vietnam using Vietnam Airlines. I have used this airline before and found them very good. Check in is good although you do have to line up as the planes are usually full. The staff and service are excellent and the in flight is as good as it gets, but sometimes you may get a Vietnamese national that is hard to understand. The food on the plane is mainly Vietnamese but as I like noodles it is ok. The flight is as long as you want it to be at around 8.5 hours, leg room is good unless you are very tall and the flight crew are helpful.Price wise they are not too naughty. So all up I would give them 9 our of 10. Regards Barry"
690,BethanyKate9593,5,"Excellent check-in experience. Polite and professional staff. Our flight was actually delayed by 2hrs ( a sydney airport weather issue) so they gave us 20 dollar vouchers! Food was great ( by plane standards haha). They even gave us bottles of water, which is invaluable on an international flight! Safety was a priority, and all staff were on the ball. All in all a very easy and comfortable flight!"
690,yangxie,5,Food is tasty; flight attendants do care about customers; cup noodles and sandwiches are available at night. Seats are narrow though.
690,Haytham Abu Firas,4,"During my trip to Vietnam, I travelled from Ho Chi Minh to Hoi An, and again from Hoi An to Hanoi. The flight is nice and comfortable. Nice and helpful crew. Everything goes smooth from take off to landing. Extra pay for food and beverages."
690,zhenfeng84,3,"Do not except their business class service to be as premium as singapore airline or emirates. It's decent, the choice of food, and service are acceptable but nothing too fanciful. If you are flying internally within vietnam, this will definitely be the first choice!"
691,G&amp;S,4,"We are not regular overseas travellers but Service, food, cleanliness <br>&amp; plane were all exceptional<br>Would certainly recomend👍👍👍"
691,D P,5,Basic flight that was 2 hours <br>Staff polite and efficient <br>Snack and drink given on plane<br>Check in straight forward and thoughtful seat planning on a half full flight
691,coralbark,1,"Vietnam is a state-owned company, owned by the Vietnamese Gov't. MOST people who are working there are well connected to the government, but do not understand about customer service and are not even qualified to do their jobs effectively. <br><br>I did not put my luggage on the scale and it has 9kg on a meter already.  I pointed it out to the agent that the scale needs to recalibrate. She refused, but willing to charge me for extra weight. Highway robbery.<br><br>Not very knowledgeable about their jobs.  Most agents have to ask dumb questions. Yelling out to each other from one end to another end of the counter.  Have they ever heard of a phone or a walkie-talkie? <br><br>Gate agents arguing among themselves and have very negative attitude to each other. Stop drinking too much Vietnamese coffee, this may help you calmer and be more polite to each other and still able to do your job effectively.<br><br>The fligh attendants are very catty to each other during the flight. Don't count on them for help in the event of emergency. <br><br>The airplane is new, but I don't trust their maintenance program.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines has a systemic problem with poor customer service and honesty.  I would NOT recommend anyone to fly on Vietnam Airlines. If you hate your life that much, buy life insurance and fly with Vietnam Airlines. Your family will be sad but at least they will get a payout."
691,Beesy1950,5,We entered the airport and looked for where we needed to check in. We had only been standing looking for a couple of minutes when a member of Vietnam Airlines ground staff came and offered assistance. Check-in was fast and painless. Couldn't ask for more - we received better service from Vietnam Airlines ground staff than Malaysian Airlines at Kuala Lumpur!
691,K1469ESrobertd,1,Ask for a upgrade and you can forget it. Planes are maintained poorly on inside. Makes you wonder what is inside. Ticket persons do not understand English well enough to be placed in public relations positions. Further their personal hygiene needs a little polish. Nose picking which seems to be a national pastime is not acceptable while handling the public.
692,Alannah,3,"Pretty standard flight and service from what you'd expect for this price range airline. General amount of leg room, service with a smile. <br>Worry it to pay for extra baggage instead of doing it a thing the airport. Easy to fly internally within Vietnam. <br>Also flew with VA to Luang Prabang on a tiny plane and it was an equally fine trip."
692,blee282,5,Flight slightly delayed but arrived safely in Ho Chi Minh international airport safely for flight transfer to Singapore. Check in was fast and speedy when early. Great and flight slightly delayed and have to move to another gate nearby. Staff was great to move us accordingly with no hassle. Boarded and crew immediately cool us down with wet tissue. Crew was pressured but calm all the way and serve food and keeping us cool. Food not bad but service was nice till we landed in Singapore. Great flight and service well done to the pilots and crew. Thank you. Keep up the good service cheers
692,michael123romeo,2,"My family and friends flew with VN airlines 5 times between 2013 to 2016. At that time the price was reasonable, now too expensive.  But nothing special. The airline need to upgrade on customer service and punctuational as they keep changing schedules and staff without a smile. The airlines delayed for 5 hours in November 2016 without compensation unlike other airlines. So now we decided to use other airlines with good ranking and happy pay little extra for comfortable and good services.<br>I won't recommend VN airlines to regular travellers unless those cannot speak English then unfortunately you have to stick with them 😜"
692,ann lauchlan,5,From departure to arrival excellent service. The staff excellent courteous and professional. Meal delicious. Lenny of leg space.
692,Greg W,5,"great planes the 787, quiet, comfortable, good window darkening system, very good touchscreens. Nice staff on board who put up with the usual proportion of dills complaining or getting up and down during the food service. We never expect edible food on flights and we were not disappointed on these flights. I, however couldn't care less about the food when the seats and the planes were as good as they were. I don't go to restaurants to fly and I don't get on planes to eat. We also had a great deal on price"
693,kelvin w,5,"Plane was very modern with individual, private seats which converted to a flat bed, good choice of entertainment on screen, including interactive games, very good service from the cabin staff and excellent meals. One of the best airlines we have traveled with."
693,obancas,5,We went on July 2 for 12 days in HCM. the layout in bussiness class 1-2-1 is great with the new seat style beds in your own space. The wine and meal service very good indeed the dreamliner has cabin windows that you can tint to keep the light out. <br>The plane was full and the cabin crew attended to every request quickly. We will use again.
693,Hugh M,4,Prior to arriving in Saigon I had a friend try to change my seat booking due to medical reasons - was unable to share points to do so. Upon check in at gate VN crew tried to offer me a different seat despite them misunderstanding the need for the request - my travelling companions (who were Viet) tried to help but made it worse so I got no new seat and the seats we had were the last row next to toilet bulkhead so no room to lean back. We were offered a row further up but my companions shot that down. The crew were really good despite the misunderstanding - note for future - look after yourself
693,Arun b,4,"On the new 787s the seats are very comfortable, even on the 13 hour flight to SGN. Good entertainment options as well, although the headphones handed out are poor, and you can't use your own as it is 2 jack input. The flight attendants were good, but not overly friendly, and the food and drink was very good compared with other airlines in economy. Our bags were lost on return to LHR, but it was not their fault, but the ground company they use, and our bags were delivered to us later the same day, which was very helpful. Overall, considering the price was so much lower than others, we would definitely fly on them again."
693,Pink P,3,"Just flew from Hanoi to Saigon.  Nice plane - new dreamliner.  Economy class so nothing special about seats but they were ok.  They did have a nice large seatback TV - larger than most, but for some reason didn't switch the VOD on until about half way through the flight.  After we took off they showed a ""funniest videos"" kind of thing.  Kinda wonder why they ""force fed"" that when there were lots of other options once they switched everything on.  They did serve a snack (sandwich and fruit) with a cold drink, which was a surprise considering the flight was less than 2 hours in the air. <br><br>Earlier this week I also flew with them from Saigon to Da Nang and then from Da Nang to Hanoi.  Both flights were delayed by an hour.  So time keeping doesn't seem to be their strong suit.  Neither of these planes had seatback entertainment (or overhead for that matter) and all they served was a bottle of water.  Both flights were about 90 minutes so there would have been time for a hot drink.<br><br>They are a member of Sky Team, which is why I chose them over the numerous discount airlines available within Asia, but they don't seem to understand that being a member of Sky Team means they're supposed to honor the benefits afforded to Sky Team frequent flyers.  They did have a separate boarding line for Sky Team Elite passengers but on every occasion they started boarding from the other line first.  Ditto with the baggage handling - the luggage with the priority tags were never the first on the carousel.  So it seems they want the advantages of being in Sky Team (ie attracting frequent flyers who always try to stick to the same alliance) but they don't want to do their part.<br><br>All in all, they were OK.  Just OK.  Their tag line is ""Reach Further"".  Well Vietnam Airlines, you need to keep reaching because you ain't there yet!"
694,hollyinthesunny,4,We flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Siem Reap . This was the first time We  came this country . We booked hotel and picked up us from the air port . That was great trip .
694,roger m,4,i found the new seats in business class great.no body has to climb over anybody to go to the wash room.the seats went flat when you wanted to sleep .staff very efficient.
694,ACMILANFAN1,5,"Don't be a turkey by flying with Latejet, otherwise known as Vietjet.<br>If you value your time or have connecting flights, your holiday will end up in a disaster if you try to 'save' a few dollars by flying Vietjet.<br>These days Vietnam Airlines is always on time and reliable.<br>The cabin crew on Vietnam Airlines is professional and properly trained.<br>Vietnam Airlines allows 20kg of baggage."
694,mike_ign,4,"We flew from Moscow to Phu Quoc island through Hanoi and back. Both flights (from Moscow and from Hanoi) were delayed more than for 2 hours due to planes' late arrival. <br>Crew on board is not attentive enough for your requests (they can simply ignore or forget about a drink you asked them for). <br>On-line check-in wasn't working well on any mobile device - only in several desktop browsers with flash player installed, that is ridiculous."
694,Tess13,5,"A very good value airline. New planes. Dream liners and A350. Really comfortable cabin. Seats go 1,2,1. Heaps of space. Really good crew. Food was quite good. Entertainment was pretty average but still a few films worth watching. For cheaper than some airlines premium they are really amazing value"
696,Ouderkerk,3,"Good company with nice staff and brand new aircrafts. But the price was high : i booked late, so i guess it is the reason."
696,lcostabi,4,Comfortable and clean. <br><br>Food was good and staff very friendly.<br><br>Good availability of movies games etc<br><br>Steady flight and announcement made in both Vietnamese and English and quite clear
696,StevenL4212,4,"A nice comfortable internal flight from Hue to Hanoi. Staff efficiently handed out water bottles to passengers, it was only a very short flight so no food offered. Boarding was easy and quick as was disembarkation, as luggage quickly on the baggage carousel, so no real issues here."
696,Jen,4,board the flight with a breeze. first time taking this airline due to promotional fares. the services rendered was average. but the overall experience was a pleasant surprise.
696,itaptourist,5,"We have been to Vietnam 3 times with 2 different carriers. Vietnam airlines was superior in all ways. Cabin service on long haul flights can make a journey either filled with pleasant memories or horror stories. We found the cabin crew professional and courteous. On our return flight, I watched the crew deal with two men who appeared to be problematic. They stopped the men from escalating their unruly behaviour before we took off and made it clear to them that they were on notice and they risked being taken off the flight. It was reassuring to see how the cabin crew were supported by their supervisor and how they did not hesitate to have the necessary and confrontational conversation with the trouble makers.<br>I was so impressed with this staff response that I wrote to the airline to applaud their staff. It was lovely to receive a thought thank you letter from the airline for taking the time to provide them some positive feedback."
697,Andrew R,3,"London to Hong Kong via Ho Chi Minh in Economy. The fare was good and the aircraft brand new, but the service was well short of expectations. The earphones are old style, so bring your own (and plug adaptor). Films are OK, but audio selection and TV very limited. <br><br>The food and service was dire. The fruit selection was edible out of London, but inedible from Ho Chi Minh. On both sectors the salad was warm and the hot meal cold.  And to compound it all, for the second meal from London, breakfast before arriving in Ho Chi Minh, there was no tea or coffee service. <br><br>Basically the airline needs a big shake up."
697,Andrew R,3,"Flew Hong Kong to London via Hanoi. An A321 from Hong Kong and a B787 from Hanoi. The layover in Hanoi was tedious, but the airport is modern and there is good wifi. The flights were on time and seats comfortable. Two disappointments were the food and the inflight entertainment [IFE]. The food was seem to have been modelled on 1970s airline catering and was grim. Apparently there was a menu, but I never saw this, so was offered a choice of Western or Asian. Both were equally plastic. <br><br>The IFE was Ok for film. However TV mainly consisted of candid camera options, which were boringly repetitive. Similarly the music options were very limited, not helped by confused categories. Under Rock &amp; Pop you could find Lullabies for Kids.The listing brochure didn't help in that a very small font was used, making it difficult to read. <br><br>Overall an average flight. The price was good and it was on time, but nothing else to offer."
697,Anniek1950,4,"This was one of the best flights I have had. Check in staff very helpful and polite. Crew went out of there way to be helpful and handled another passenger who was being difficult in a most caring and professional manner.American pilot who was very informative about our trip.Aircraft was spotless, food average,but was hot unlike some other airlines recently.Great flight."
697,Arnauld M,3,"I choose Vietnam airlines for this flight.<br>Good welcome, <br>but the flight was late 1 hour and they don't offer a small drink inside the plane."

698,Faith L,4,"It was our first time onboard a Vietnam Airlines flight. Flight time was convenient. Although there was a 45 min delay, they notified us through email a couple of hours in advance which was quite helpful. <br><br>Online app was useful in checking in. Cabin service was decent and quite a number of movies to choose from on their in-flight entertainment. The only down-side is subtitles are in Vietnamese. <br><br>Good value for money compared to CX."
698,Bernard D,5,We booked our flights to Europe very late and found that VN was the best priced airline for our dates. We had a Boeing Dreamliner from Sydney to Saigon and then an Airbus 350 from Saigon to Paris. Both planes were near new and offered sufficient leg room. Entertainment system worked well but the range on offer is more limited than other asian airlines. Food was very reasonable as was the smiling service on both flights.
698,NHANHOAI,3,"One good thing of Vietnam airlines compared with other local carriers is their on time reliability is higher. This flight is also an on time departure. Regarding onboard service, there's not much to say as it's a short flight roughly 45 minutes and we're only treated with a bottle of water. Flight is smooth and we arrive on time."
699,nadiamarkus,1,cheap dreadful airline. no in service entertainment. tiny food portions. minimal english spoken. shocking flight.
699,halnoe,5,"Having not traveled with this airline before, we would have to say we were very impressed with the service and service."
699,Barnsy63,3,"Staff and service great but a 3 hour delay in Melbourne and about 2 hours of that on the plane. No communication on the delay unlit some time into the wait. ""luggage door wont shut"" No follow up service after the flight.<br>Every flight with in Vietnam was delayed. Return flight from Hanoi was delayed for us  hours for some we meet  hours. No area supplied with water, food etc for our comfort.<br>I don't know about you but when leaving a country I use up my $$$$'s on gifts for home to then find out plane has a huge delay and you were expecting dinner on the flight. When I asked what we were to do I was directed to the gate of the cancelled flight. I said will they be able to help me ""arh no"" well at least he was honest."
699,Chris W,4,"Good flight, great friendly staff. A comfortable journey. Would definitely use this service again. HOWEVER!!!....my review is more about the Ho Chi Minh AIRPORT TAXIS <br>What a bunch of scammers! If you are getting a cab and you are walking across the pedestrian crossing to the car parks...YOU are going the wrong way! Turn around and order a taxi from the stand otherwise.....you Will be taken for a RIDE.<br>My advice, use hotel transfers and avoid Getting taken for a RIDE!"
699,Tim A,4,"Have flown with VA previously &amp; have just flown return Melbourne to HCM as well as 3 internal flights. All flights departed &amp; arrived within 5 mins of their designated times. The international flights were on modern planes that were clean and tidy, the planes on the domestic flights were looking a bit tired &amp; run down (inside). I am 6ft tall &amp; leg room was fine,  I could fully extend my legs on all planes we flew on. Entertainment is average on international flights &amp; non-existent on domestic. You get individual screens with a basic range of music, TV shows &amp; games. One very annoying thing is that every time there is a PA announcement, the screens turn off. They resume at the same spot but its still a pain! There is a USB charger for your portable gear &amp; the standard 2 pin airline headphone jack. A tip for travelers, if you have normal headphones (single pin) you can still get audio in both ears. Put the plug into one of the sockets &amp; (while wearing your headphones) slide the pins in &amp; out a bit &amp; you should be able to get it in a position where you can hear sound in both channels. <br>Meals (International, nothing served on domestic) were served shortly after takeoff &amp; despite what you hear about airline food, the meals were all perfectly ok. There were two choices for each meal &amp; nothing was too spicy. You could get a beer, wine, spirits, soft drink, juice or water with the meal. You get 30kg baggage on international &amp; 20kg on domestic. Carry on was never weighed or checked for size. Service is efficient but I wouldn't call it overly friendly. I would recommend VA &amp; would be happy to fly with them again."
700,Ha P,4,We were traveling from Sydney to Ha Noi then connected flight from there to Paris! It was a smooth flight!  The flat bed was perfect for long haul... the in flight service could be better but no complaints because we were only need a good sleep 😂
700,Lorraine B,4,"Overall the airline was very efficient.  We travelled internally with Vietnam Airlines too and found they always departed on time.  Check in was no fuss.  Baggage claim was efficient with little waiting time. Seating was comparable with other airlines and the service was efficient.  We found the food to be a let down, were expecting lovely flavours but received bland meals. I would probably fly them again because of their efficiency and comfort but bring some snacks to eat."
700,ajp8808,4,"This is the second time that we have flown Vietnam Airlines and have found them to be quite good.  The food, seating and service is good.  I would fly with them again."
700,iam.Misa,4,good service<br>but : delay time ( 2 time in a flight) and no announce the delay of Flight.. due to technical reasons
700,Kerianne B,1,"My partner and i took 3 internal flights with vietnam airlines and it was the worst flights i have experienced in my life. The landings were horrible to the point stuff went flying, water bottles, books my partner got hit in the head by a flying water bottle. We paid extra for a fully serviced flight in which we recieved 1 bottle of water and no entertainment and no legroom at all. We have used budget airlines to fly internally through Thailand. We have got water, coffee a snack and entertainment. NEVER AGAIN WILL I FLY VIETNAM."
701,Sarla T,5,"We have been in Vietnam few time already and we like Vietnam Airlines service, the flights are always on time, the staff is very professional and we always have a positive experience. <br>Once we flight on Business class and it was amazing, they have a great lounge room, with amazing food and fast WIFI.<br>The vegetarian food in the planes not the best we had, so not expect much if you have a specific need. <br>If you want to sit in the emergency rows, you don't have to reserve them when making the reservation, just make sure you arrive to airport with enough time and when check in request the emergency row, you don't have to pay extra, amazing find."
701,marriagesnmore,4,Having flown with them before I knew what to expect and was not disappointed.                 Staff always very friendly and helpful and Movies to watch whittled away the hours. Food was fine as far as plain food goes and always served with a smile..
701,Brenda M,5,"We flew from Shanghai to Melbourne in business class the service for the entire flight was great. There was a delay in Shanghai which meant that our connecting flight was waiting for us, so we were rushed through the Ho Chi Minh airport but once back on board things calmed down. I would definitely fly with them again"
701,Bruce F,4,"I would highly recommend travelling business class on internal flights in Vietnam. The increased cost is quite low but the benefits are high. In Hanoi and HCMC there are excellent business class lounges that make waiting easy. In Hanoi, Danang and HCMC, you get through very quickly rather than the long queues in tourist class and importantly for me (I am tall and have bad knees) the seats are large, comfortable and have plenty of leg-room"
701,Justin B,3,"Our family of four (two adults, two children aged 5 and 3) flew Hanoi to Phu Quoc return in late August. The in-flight service was unfriendly, the food (especially for the kids) was poor, and the cabin was not cleaned properly from the previous flight. Departing Hanoi, there was a long wait on a very crowded transit bus (most flights don't have air bridges) and the flight left 45 mins late. On the return leg, the flight left 15 mins early, without any communication to passengers prior or at check-in. We have flown a lot within Vietnam, and this seems to be a fairly typical experience."
702,JanineC58,4,"After reading many bad reviews about this airline I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. Previous reviews complained about the food and service, but I could not complain at all, there was plenty of good food and the crew were great. We had many flights around Vietnam and did not have any major problems, only 1 slight delay due to an electical storm which I was glad we weren't flying in. All in all I would recommend this airline to anyone who was flying to Vietnam"
702,margatsit,4,Our flight was on time and no delays or issues with airlines to our destinations.  The cabin staff were courteous and friendly.  Good in-flight entertainment and the plane was clean and comfortable.  Great value for the price we paid for the flight.
702,gobunti,4,"This was the connecting leg of a longer flight from Paris. The plane was relatively full but departure was prompt and well managed. Cabin service was copious and of surprisingly good quality, flight attendants friendly and helpful. An excellent flight."
702,AprilFNP,3,"The staff were very nice.  Quick flight so no real beverage or food options.  Gate staff very helpful.  Plane was packed as I expected.  Not a lot of leg room, but about average for economy in country flight.  Be early so you can get spot for your carry on as it gets filled quickly."
702,Grant L,5,"Modern plane (787 Dreamliner), good leg room, friendly staff, good meal service, good inflight entertainment, punctuality."
703,davidtan2016,5,"While I cannot say much about prompt departure of its flight, I must add that I made changes n enquiries to my flight n was amazed that the customer service rep,Eid almost immediately n very helpful in suggestions. I had a double booking in HCM to Mnl n my duplicated fares were refunded even without my knowing Nor request. If flight departures are improved, Vietnam Air will be better than SIA"
703,Christine T,5,"We used this airline a few times in our travels throughout Vietnam.<br>Each time  we had good friendly service, a lot different from other airlines..It was clean,comfortable and on time."
703,Craig P,4,"Great trip, all staff helpful,great food and beverage service and quality. I would not hesitate to recommend this airline."
703,Marla A,4,I had a nice flight with Vietnam airlines and the flight was on time. The only thing that disappointed me is that my guide said the company had an Airport express Bus to town and it didn't have anymore.
703,Andreas S,5,"We had a direct flight from FRA to HAN, which takes 11 hours and due to the excellent entertainment program the flight was pretty good! Food was excellent, service was great. Space in economy class is comparable to others, so not really comfortable, but really ok."
704,Chris C,3,"Spent 13 hours like a caged animal, small amount of leg room for such a long flight. Meals were not bad and staff were happy and helpful. On board entertainment was limited and on the way there and broken on the way back (touch screen didn't work)  arm  rest controls did work but wasn't able to use all of the (limited) functions. Overall nothing to rave about but it served the purpose and we arrived safely and on time!"
704,Kalampoki,5,"Our flight actually departed around 10 minutes late and arrived 40 minutes early! It was a smooth flight, we were looked after well by the air steward/esses who were very attentive.  The food was good, there were a variety of films to watch, enough space.  Very pleasant, I would certainly recommend this airline and look forward to flying with them again."
704,knightswoodcourt,3,Flight was delayed when I travelled to Danang and also coming back to Tokyo.<br>No announcement for the reason of the delayed was made untill i asked the person at the counter.<br>I hope their response will be more appropriate next time.
704,ange1806,4,Been a few years since I've used virgin airways. Service was good. Found leg room and bit tight. Not sure if seating has shrunk to get more seats in.  Never ever considered buying extra legroom before but will do in the future if I use them again. <br>Or use British airways as not much difference just in price £5-£10 <br>Happy to say they don't give out peanuts on the flight so no announcement needed
704,lynetteme50,5,Flight was very smooth and so was the landing.Flight staff were courteous  and food was typical airline  fare.Movies and entertainment  available  were good.Internal flights were also  with Vietnam  airlines and  they were  also good.
705,Maorimars2014,4,"Short flight, very good in flight service for such a short flight. No worries here, departed on time got to destination on time, staff were friendly, helpful and professional."
705,Nadar7,4,"They were not the cheapest, but word had it they were the most reliable of domestic Vietnamese airlines. The price comes down if you book well in advance and further reduces if you don't have flexible tickets.<br>You ae able to check in on line prior to the flight. This saves time at the airport.<br>We got pretty hot waiting for a bus to take us from the gate to the plane, but once on board it was cooler.<br>Flight was close to on time. Water provided on flight and a wet cloth.<br>We had an airbridge at the other end, which was nicer.<br>Word to the wise - allow plenty of time if you're joining up to a international flight, as Vietnamese airlines often run late or get cancelled, so factor this in, and try to go a couple of flights earlier for your domestic leg."
705,GuyBJ53,4,"The flight was full, but even in economy we did not feel too cramped. Service was friendly and efficient. Food was good with a choice of a European or Asian style menu. The Dreamliner is a relatively new plane and as such the seats were very clean and firm and all inflight entertainment worked well. They even have a USB port to connect your own device. All in all a very smooth flight which left and arrived on time."
705,Laura G,5,"we flew vietnam airlines to ho chi minh city. modern plane, great entertainment packages, the food was reasonable. leg room standard in economy. staff were friendly, a great ecperience"
705,Julie T,5,"Excellent airline, could not do enough for us. <br>Airline food was good, continuous top up of drinks, did not have to ask.<br>Would highly recommend"
706,Graham D,5,Flew on an A 320 very comfortable and very new.  Service was great and emplane and deplane were ok .  I am not a fan of the long bus ride to the aircraft.<br>Apart from that I would use this airline anytime.
706,JessicaHarris89,5,Highly recommended. New and modern planes with comfortable reclining seats. The food was better than expected with complimentary drinks and hot refreshing towels throughout. The service was great and the flight wasn't so unbearable. Have flown on long haul flights in the past but Vietnam airlines has been one of the best
706,Sung-Keun L,3,"Airplane was old, food was barely edible.  Seats need to be refurnished or replaced.  However, price of the airfare was cheap.    Since I needed few amenities and only wanted a comfortable seat, I was happy to buy this ticket.  I sleep through most of the flight."
706,davidm_uk,5,"First time flying with Vietnam Airlines, and in a 787 Dreamliner. Very pleased with the whole experience. Comfortable fully reclining seats in your own cubicle, plenty of space for your bits &amp; pieces, good choice of entertainment. The service and food was excellent, very friendly cabin crew.<br><br>Hate to have to say it, but much better value for money than BA for equivalent seats (VA Business comparable with BA First)!!"
706,dodik_Mahardika,3,"I fly with them twice and we got a transit at saigon, my first  imprecation was bad as the was delayed for 1 hour and its make us will be come late night  at hanoi and i missed some of my schedule.<br>the ground services was so so but their on board services was need improvement, especially at their way to serve, when they serve the meal the gap with in the meal come and drink come was too long so it make some of us find some difficulty  to enjoy the meals its will be better if they serve the meal in a package with the first dink and then they could serve secondary drink letter"
707,Ollie R,3,Flight was delayed by half an hour and I have a child that didn't get their meal because you need to confirm your meal 24 hours before. He ended up having an adults meal.
707,RAM14146,4,"I have flown to Saigon several times and have always found the quality of service to a very acceptable standard. The cabin staff were very attentive and catering was acceptable. As it is a 13 hour flight, and if someone else is paying, try a travel in Business Class. The time will pass much quicker as it is easier to sleep after a few glasses of refreshment in the very comfortable seats."
707,mr r,4,"Never flown with Vietnam airlines, so usually trepidation for a first time with a new Airline, Very pleasantly surprised. plane was Clean, On-Board staff were friendly and attentive, service was good and the food choice was more then adequate. Would have no hesitation in using them again. Also travelled internally between Cambodia / Vietnam, and all flights were good and punctual."
707,gay p,5,Check in went smoothly; flight was on time and landed on time; baggage  collecting was quite quick; staff at both airports and on board were friendly and professional.
707,Peter B,4,"An excellent alternative if flying to Australia (via Vietnam). Booking 4 months in advance, secured an outstanding business class return fare LHR-SYD with stopovers in HCMC. Three of the four legs in new planes, one leg in an older plane. Business food, drink and service was excellent. The inflight entertainment was slightly dated but overall the experience was better than expected.<br><br>Ho Chi Minh City a food lovers delight with much to explore...<br><br>I have flown this journey four times now and can highly recommend this route especially if you get in early for the cheaper ticket prices..."
708,Pascale L,5,"We decided to fly for the 2nd time with Vietnam Airline in Economic Plus.<br>We do fly a lot, mostly long distance and we really appreciate flying with this company. Boarding in time, flight in time, new plane, seats are very comfortable, good service, stewardesses discreet and efficient. We look forward flying with this company again"
708,SeanCN,5,"We flew with Vietnam airlines for the whole of our stay. We flew from Heathrow to Hanoi, Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh, Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang, Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh and Hi Chi Minh to Heathrow. <br>All of the flights were on time, check in was quick and easy at all of the airports. The flight crew on all the flights are friendly and helpful when needed. Food was usual airplane standard with both Asian and Western food options, although if you were toward the rear of the plane your choice may have been limited.<br>Drinks were served throughout, we found it easier to go the galley and ask rather than press the attendant button.<br>Entertainment is the usual choice of new movies and lots of old ones.<br>All in all great service!"
708,James S,5,The check in procedure was very efficient and the flight departed on time. The in-flight service by the cabin crew was above what could be expected for a international operator. The meals served were very eatable.
708,DENIS C,3,"very average service , stewardesses spoke almost no English , one spilled some drink on me , just an excuse me , I had to ask her to bring some tissues to clean myself, food very average"
708,sharynegsmith,4,"We were flying from Melbourne to Cambodia via Vietnam, twice our flight from Vietnam to Cambodia were cancelled so we had to leave a day early only for that flight to be cancelled, we  had to stay in Vietnam over night, Vietnam airlines paid for our visas, transfers, hotel and meals, the flight itself and the staff were great, my tv never worked so they upgraded us, would definitely fly with them again"
709,trish f,2,"We flew Vietnam airlines for all internal flights South to North Vietnam. When we travel Thailand we normally just use budget internal flights but this time we spent a little extra for a fully serviced flight and got alot less. 1 bottle of water, no entertainment compared to water, coffee and snack we have recieved on BUDGET internal flights through Thailand. My partner &amp; i who hate flying experienced the worst landings of an aircraft i have ever encountered on 2 of the 3 flights to where i got hit in the head from flying objects and 2 young guys next to us who love flying almost crapped their pants. Stick with Vietjet or Jetstar Pacific you may not have to change your pants when you get to your destination"
709,639Kay,4,"We had no problems and the staff were most accommodating.  We had checked reviews on flights and were not impressed with reviews of economy class for Vietnam airlines.   As older folk, we wanted the direct flight that only Vietnam airlines offered and decided that we would upgrade to business class.  This was a treat for us and we were pleased we did.  Staff were attentive would recommend the flight rather than going via Bangkok or Singapore which added so much more time."
709,Katrina B,3,"We had a few flights internally with this airline and all of them were over an hour late. No explanation, just told they were delayed. It meant some very late nights.<br>We were told we had exit row seats and then got on board to find they were in front of the exit row and did not decline. We are both very tall, so it was uncomfortable."
709,teroti,4,"Just a short flight but well cared for on this airline, all staff attentive and kind, seems to be the best form  of long distance transport in Vietnam, the motor bike the Vietnamese choice by far the most popular.<br>Vietnam is a long thin country and short quick flights help you get around easily."
709,Bobbywideadventures,4,"After winning the Sun Dream Team fantasy football season competition i decided to do some more travelling, yet still look for affordable prudent options.  Vietnam's business class did not let me down, it was only around $1700, there was ample leg room, a comfy reclining seat, a good selection of films and TV shows and most importantly an efficient and friendly service."
710,Stuart D,5,We travelled from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh city in July and before we departed I discovered I could bid to upgrade to premium economy. The total cost for two to upgrade was around $280. This was awesome as when we got on the plane there were 5 people in our cabin where as the rest of the plane was full. We had extra legroom. Personalised service and also meals etc were delivered to us first. Travelling as a couple with no kids this was bliss. And it was affordable.
710,miiliemoo,4,We flew with Vietnamese airlines on the new Dreamliner in January. It is a busy time of year and so the line at the airport for check in was huge and slow.<br>Once on the plane we were happy with the size and comfort of the seats. <br>Service was good although the staff looked a bit tired.<br>Food was good and the choice of movies etc. was fine for the 7-8 hour trip.<br>Overall the plane was great and the return journey which was overnight was also good.<br>On our return journey the checkin was again very slow.<br>But we had an exit seat with lots of room on a very full plane.<br>Great value for money.<br>Would definitely use Vietnam airlines again.
710,Thomas D,4,On a stopover I made in Hanoi my illness worsened greatly and I really HAD to get back to Thailand early. Vietnam Airlines was so very helpful in booking me 1 hour before a plane left. Vietnam Airlines is not only competitive in price but a very classy service. I have flown with them many times and have booked with them again for a flight in October.
710,Robyn M,4,"The trip to HCMC started with a little issue- the business class food was late on board, so we waited( would rather have food late then none!!) once on board, we found that our pods were exactly as photographed and extremely comfortable, making the trip relaxed. <br>Two things  travellers should be aware of- if a fellow passnger asks for the blinds down in the middle of the day, hand him eye shades of you don't like travelling in the dark and the company allows only 3 glasses of wine per person even in business so don't plan on your glass being topped up unless you ask. <br>The food was great, with some tasty Vietnamese choices. The crew was also very attentive.<br>The return flight was every bit as good. We are hoping to go back early next year so look forward to flying with Vietnam again."
710,DJ Adityo,4,Sometimes business class is great and other times a bit less but for just a little more money than  economy you can get this class. Buy it on the airline site.
711,Lorraine C,3,"Melb to vietnam good<br>Cambodia to vietnam good<br>Vietnam to melb had tv issues for length of flight, not good"
711,markaruma,4,"Great service on the airline. More than usual leg room. Relatively on time. I found the Japanese crew were more hospitable than the Vietnamese crew, but nothing to complain about. Food was very good, compared to some other airlines. Alcohol service was very good."
711,Evy,4,"It was our first experience with Vietnam Airlines and we were quite happy with it. In fact we use it often now to travel in and from Vietnam. You can tell that the flight attendances are doing their best, they are polite and try to help. Only one note on short distance flights that mostly don't have personal entertainment system, which is quite important when you fly with kids :) I personally like the fact that buying ticket in their website is easy."
711,Julie T,4,"We flew to Vietnam from Melbourne direct to ho chi min, then changed flights to Danang. Clearing customs was quick with a valid visa.  We flew 2 years ago with Vietnam airlines they have improved the checkin process. Still a little primitive but easy enough to work out."
711,destaur,4,"After using Jetstar and being so disappointed in their lack of interest and service, Vietnam airlines outshone by far. Good old fashioned attention to detail, and courteous crew made it a pleasant trip. Plenty of food, plenty of drinks and crew that were only too happy to help in any way, unlike Jetstar crew who could not give a damn. On my return, I upgraded to premium economy and it was a good decision.The seating was much more spacious with heaps of leg room and a good recline and the service was even better. I would not hesitate flying with them again."
712,Ian W,4,"Great flight, comfortable, attentive crew. The only negative was one of the meals had run out of our option but the remaining dish was fine.<br>The second leg to Danang was again very good."
712,Young P,1,"This flight was a disaster.  From the start they ask you for a visa to fly into China.  I transited out from Shanghai and it clearly stated that on my passport.  However, they kept asking me about my visa.  If they are servicing to China, they should know all the visa requirements before wasting 40 minutes of my time.  Then I get on the flight and the remote control for the in flight system is completely broken.  There was no wire attached to it.  I asked the flight attendant to move and he told me that he would after we were up in the air.  I was with my daughter and her system didn't work either.  Finally after 30 minutes, I asked the same flight attendant and he flat out lied and said that the engineer was fixing the system.  I don't know how they could fix the remote while up in the air.  I was upset and  complained to another flight attendant and finally she told me that there were no other seats that were together.  If they would have told me the truth, there wouldn't be any problems.  They flat out lied and then try to cover it up.  Terrible airline and truly a budget airline in terms of service.   The jet was in terrible condition.  About half of the monitors didn't work."
712,Bluedaisyglass,4,Advice. - all planes leave at same time around midnight so check in nightmare . We got there two and a half hours early and queued for the whole time . Thought we might miss it. Get there early. <br>Food not so good towards London but excellent choices on way to hanoi from London. Two internal flights excellent.new planes for international flights with funky LED window lighting and lots of movie TV choices on personal screens.
712,TheWindintheWillow,5,"our final destination was Paris, we could had chosen a number of other more ""established"" airlines but we decided to give Vietnam airline a try because their price is very competitive.  We are very happy with our choice, the seat was flat, very roomy and comfortable, air crew was very helpful and friendly, couldn't expect more."
712,Carole the donut hunter,5,"I thought the price of flying with Vietnam Airlines was very cheap and a quick way of getting from point A to point B, with short flights of up to an hour's duration. The staff were very friendly and helpful and no problems with baggage."
713,Judi43,5,"Have never flown with them before but they offered the best options with reaching our destination, all staff were very friendly and they went out of there way to please, on board facilities were good and flights on time."
713,Colin616,4,"Beautiful new aircraft very quiet and peaceful only disappointment was the standard of food have experienced much better with other airlines, return flight disappointing that I had to sit in seat in front of my wife, I needed an aisle seat as I had   my right knee replaced and needed to stretch my leg out into the aisle every half hour or so."
713,Sagitaur,4,"This was my second trip doing the Frankfurt / Hanoi flight with Vietnam Airlines.<br>My trip started in Baku, Azerbaijan, and I was able to book my luggage through directly to Hanoi.  That was a big benefit, as it meant that I did not have to go through immigration in Frankfurt.  I did have a few hassles with check-in in Baku.......it took half an hour, and there was some consternation about me travelling to Viet Nam.  I guess this is not a regular occurrence in Azerbaijan.  Anyway, this is more about VN Airlines and the Frankfurt / Hanoi journey.  As I was travelling Business Class I had free access to the Sky Lounge in Terminal 2, Concourse D.  This was very convenient, as my gate was only 3 minutes away.  So I spent 4 hours in the Sky Lounge, and with free wi-fi and a good selection of food and drink, the time went quickly.<br>I had checked in via internet, however still needed to report to the counter at the gate, to obtain a hard-copy of my boarding pass.  Fortunately, the lady at the counter remembered me from last time, and it was just like old friends!<br>The plane, one of the newer Boeing 787 Dreamliners, was quite full, but with a business class ticket I was able to avoid the boarding throng, and made my way efficiently to the Business Class Cabin.  The nice thing was that there were separate doors for Business Class and Economy Class, so I was not bothered with 200 or so passengers hitting me with their oversized bags moving through the cabin to Economy Class.  As expected, I was served drinks with a cold towel; a refreshing way to start the flight.   I also received slippers, a small bag with toiletries, and the menu.  Also a selection of newspapers and magazines were made available.<br>After take-off a late lunch was served.  Apertizers included fresh salad, thin slices of beef, and a bread roll.  I also order a signature cocktail, Red River I think it was called.  Whiskey based, and quite refreshing.  Main course was a very nice beef fillet, with all the trimmings.  With some very nice red wine.  Dessert contained a selection of cheese, fruit, and crackers.<br>After a sumptuous meal, it was time for a movie and a sleep.  The Dreamliner has flat-bed seating, and you feel as though you are in a cocoon.  A small problem was the feet end of the bed was not too comfortable - I would imagine that anyone above 180cm would have problems.  Entertainment system was OK, but not as good as some of the other airlines.  Particularly the audio selection.<br>The stewardesses left us alone after the cabin lights were dimmed (about 2 1/2 hours into the 10+ hours flight), although you could order drinks when required.  Breakfast was served around 1 hour before landing in Hanoi, at 6am.  Again, the food was good, but not special.  Overall, the service was efficient, but not outstanding.  I think VN still may be a star short of its 4 star claim!<br>Alighting in Ha Noi was a stroll, no queues at immigration, and the processing was very quick.  Could not say the same about the baggage.  Even though I was in Business Class, my luggage took about 25 minutes to arrive; I did see economy class travellers, and crew, leave the carousel before I saw my bag.<br>All in all, a pleasant and restful flight."
713,mot29,5,"I booked a very good fare LHR-MEL with a 5 night stopover in Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines.  LHR-HAN is flown on a very comfortable 787.  The seats and seating area are very comfortable, big tray table that doesn't get in the way, lots of storage, and good video with a large screen and fairly good headphones.<br>Service is friendly and the food is good - I ate the crayfish entree which was more of a stuffed lobster tail.<br>Toilets seemed to be cleaned regularly.  <br>Checkin at LHR for skypriority and business class was quick and easy. SkyTeam lounge at LHR T4 was comfortable, but nothing special."
713,sharalea,5,I flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Min return flights and also in domestic flights to Danang and Nha Trang fantastic service and comfort all round. Would highly recommend again and again.
714,Charles S,4,"No nonsense experience - each of our five flights was right on time, good service, interesting entertainment and very good meals. <br>No problems in recommending!"
714,peterC700HG,5,"Travelled to Paris with a 2 day stopover in Ho Chi Minh City.<br>The flight up to HCM was daytime and it was smooth and uneventful.<br>Good quality food, excellent wines, staff were very attentive and welcoming.<br>No complaints at all - the lay flat seat accommodated my large frame. Travelled on a Boeing 787 to HCM and then on a A350 (new) to CDG and it too was very good overall.<br>The trip home from CDG was on Air France 777 to HCM and it was superb as well.<br>We took an overnight flight from HCM to Sydney on VN773 and slept a good 5 hours, very enjoyable."
714,Anne B,5,"We flew internally in Vietnam to save some time and as it was quite a lot cheaper chose business class. Unfortunately the two flights we took were quite short so couldn't get the full benefit but good to get on board first, be waited on and have that extra room. The staff were lovely and the food quite nice"
714,son n,4,I am a frequent traveler on VN Airlines.Got upgrade to Premium Economy with my Gold membership.Check in was slow at the counter event at the Sky Priority queue.The Fly was smooth with the new Dream Liner Boeing 787?.The Food is OK.As I travel alot on VN Airlines almost watched all Movies available.VN Airlines should change movies available every three months ?. I started travelling with VN Airlines since Dec 16 and up to now movies are the same.
714,RMQ8,5,Trip was on Premium Economic ( Saigon to Frankfurt)- it is a really great product on board a new 787. Very good Service and very comfortable
715,peter c,5,I had trouble finding Premium Economy on the website so just booked an economy seat.  Very comfortable seat with pillow and blanket. Vietnam In flight magazines and Headphones in seat pocket in front of you and very shortly after takeoff a varied selection of entertainment was offered on the touch screen in the seat in front. There is a choice of two selections for meals offered shortly after takeoff and before landing.  Vegetarians can order ahead when booking.
715,Hilton K,5,"This was the first time we've flown Business Class, &amp; we're now converts!  The food, drinks &amp; service were truly superb, and the layout of the seats really allowed for privacy &amp; easy sleeping.  On the return trip back from Paris to Sydney, we faced a 14-hour daytime layover in Ho Chi Minh City, and our Business Class fares entitled us to an amazing bonus - free Visas, free mini-bus transport, free day-use of a lovely Hotel Room (Ramana Hotel), free Lunch at that Hotel, a free 2.5-hour Bus Tour around the City, free Dinner at the Hotel, and Transfer back to the Airport Lounge.  Fabulous!"
715,Elizabeth_David_12,3,"The airplane on the first leg was a very basic business class, better on the next, with a flat bed into Paris. The check in was easy and the inflight service good although the inflight entertainment was only fair. The meals were well presented but the monotony of the Asian vegetarian for each meal, irrelevant of breakfast, lunch or dinner was disappointing. The business class lounge in Ho Chi Minh City was being renovated and was expected for completion by our return trip, 2 months later. Unfortunately it was not completed and the lounge we used for our delay was sub standard. The flight from Vietnam to Paris was delayed because of a flat tyre on the plane. <br>We have flown with many airlines and this experience would not bring us back to Vietnam Airlines."
715,Debi S,4,"The flight boarded and I was told that the in-flight entertainment was not working on the left-hand side of the plane where I was sitting.  As soon as the flight was airborne the two folk next to me moved and the steward said he would not put anyone else in the seats because I explained I was on a long haul to New Zealand.  I was able to have all three seats to myself!  The first time ever on a long haul.  The meal was great, the service excellent and overall the flight was very comfortable and arrived in Sydney on time."
715,Meredith M,5,"First time flyer with Vietnam Airlines. Service was impeccable, food great and lay flat beds good. I'm 5'10'' so just enough leg room when layflat - probably designed for smaller people but comfortable enough.<br>Long stopover but airline arranged a motel and a city tour for us.<br>Really cannot fault this airline for business class........."
716,Paul S,5,Very pleasant indeed cabin crew looked after us very well in a professional manner..<br>The food was as expected for economy but was very good.<br>In flight entertainment was all the latest films .<br><br>In the section below it asked when I travelled<br>It was Jan 2016 not September.
716,Cames72,5,"One of the best airlines we have ever flown with, Service, food was excellent. even for economy there was plenty of leg room. will fly Vietnam airline any time flights are available."
716,nwg1953,5,"Flight from Sydney to hcmc Saigon, left 10.30am arrived 2.30pm vn time, <br>Excellent flight on new 787 Dreamliner, food was awesome, service and friendliness of staff terrific, good range of recent movies, this airline is first class in modern clean planes. On the return it was great, the plane was not packed and I had three seats to myself so got a good sleep. Highly recommend this airline. Cost was a lot cheaper than others as well so added bonus."
716,IanP_Orewa,3,"We chose Vietnam Airlines based on Tripadvisor ratings, and they are pretty spot on - they would have to be about the best domestic airline in Vietnam.  Certainly they appear to be least affected by delays and cancellations unlike their competitors, though in saying that our flight was rescheduled one hour later and was 20min late arriving from Ho Chi Minh!  Unfortunately my planned sufficient time between this flight and our AirNZ flight back to New Zealand soon evaporated (rookie mistake) and we only just made check-in!  Glad to have gone for Business Class on Vietnam Airlines (not much more cost), as we got our bags quickly and the rapid VIP service through security was a bonus, along with the tasty in-flight meal and pre-takeoff drink.  The VIP lounge in Da Nang was not much to write home about though, was fairly dated and the food/drink selection limited, but I'd still fly with them again."
716,Yasuyuki Y,4,I had been waiting at same position for about 30 minutes for some trouble of front group while next line went well.
717,J9_61,4,"Great flight over, the team were so friendly and accommodating but coming back to Sydney the team were rude. The toilets were dirty and they did not restock the toilet paper! Everything I asked for seemed to be an imposition."
717,trang v,3,"Effort of Vietnam Airlines (VNA) to become 4-star airline in Skytrax has brought many advantages to passengers. I have used service of VNA for 10 years and can see the breakthrough in every side of this airlines. More modern aircraft, better trained crew members, better service, never easier to book tickets through many channels. Only one thing I think should be improved much is food/light meal in flight, very bad, even can say terrible. I hardly can finish my food, except fruit or sweet soup. Rice or noodle is really bad. They may prepare some cake or sausage seems much better than their cooked food...However, to overcome this, you can prepare food for yourself and still enjoy the flight as it should be. Especially you travel with kids, should prepare snack or light meal/fruit for them. All should be fine!"
717,kowalski_1985,3,"Again (if you read my review on Vietjet Air and flight operations in Vietnam), our flight was delayed due to technical fault. And because we had a connecting flight to catch from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore, the ground staff was beyond helpful in getting us priority boarding and seats with extra legroom on the later flight that we were bumped onto. They also offered to have our check-in baggage to be loaded into the business class cargo for expedited retrieval upon arrival in Ho Chi Minh.<br><br>When we arrived in Ho Chi Minh airport, we were quite impressed to see one of their ground staff holding a placard of our names to receive us and escort us from the domestic to international terminal and ensured we got priority at the check-in counter, even though the connecting flight was with a different airline. <br><br>As you might have guessed, we didn't miss our connecting flight. The entire process was still smooth and their ground staff made sure of that. Well done VN."
717,Nam Hung T,3,"I had quite a lot of bad experiences with Vietnam Airlines before, due to the cold attitude of the crew members, the bad quality of food and the frequent delays encountered. Therefore, I did not hold very high hope when we flew back to Singapore from Hanoi some time ago. Well, I was quite surprised. The food was still average, but has improved (even my son could almost finish his portion, which is an achievement itself). The crew members was warmer and more attentive, and the flight took off and landed on time. Maybe as part of the process of keeping the Skyteam membership, they had to undergo some training or certifications. Anyway, good progress, keep it up, and you will slowly shake off your bad reputation in the past."
717,JohnSaliba,5,"The Dreamliner has comfortable Seats with plenty of leg room, good entertainment system and good staff. Will definitely fly with them again."
718,Will D,4,"I needed to go from Sydney to Paris recently.  I chose Vietnam Airlines (I had never flown them before) as they offered a good deal, a good price and an up-grade to Premium Economy.  The downside was having to get a Vise in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and Hanoi both ways as this is an internal flight and there is a very long wait (15 hours) to take the next final leg to Sydney. <br><br>In all a surprisingly good experience and I have booked again to go Sydney-Paris return in October 2017."
718,trevor w,4,"New aircraft, friendly flight attendants and efficient check in, Vietnam airlines provided an excellent service.<br>Thanks"
718,mozev,1,"Boarding was incredibly disorganised, we found the seating uncomfortable and smaller than those of other airlines. The food was barely warm and almost inedible, and for the first time I preferred to stay hungry to eating what was on offer. I was not able to use the online entertainment as my set didnt work! I was not offered an alternate seat and the set was not fixed. The journey was truly unpleasant, I will not fly Vietnames airlines again."
718,Roger L,4,I have travelled to Vietnam a number of times on several different airlines in recent years and I have to admit that Vietnam Airlines can mix it with the big boys.  Very good service at an affordable price with several options available.  Check in is a bit busy so allow a few hours at both ends of the trip.  Well worth the experience in my opinion and better than some of the other major airlines I have travelled with.
718,Megan B,4,"Travelling from Melbourne to London, unfortunately not one of my 3 flights left on time. <br><br>However due to delays and technical difficulties Vietnam airlines did do everything possible to make sure that I made my flights."
719,SENTHAO,4,After a long time could fly on time. The flight was on time and comfortable flight. Perhaps it was morning flight and no delays. We enjoyed flight. The cleanliness and seats were comfortable. Landing and take off was indeed smooth
719,Denys,4,"We flew 3 times with Viertnam Airlines during our trip last February 2017.  The domestic flights between Danang and Dalat, then Dalat to Ho Chi Minh were on time, no surprises.  In that manner, they were very efficient.  Those flights were short and they provided a bottle of water on the flight.  We were glad of how it worked out for us.<br><br>On a flight from Siem Reap, Cambodia back to Ho Chi Minh, it didn't go that smooth.  There was some little noises on the plane, on take off.  Didn't know what it was but it wasn't comforting.  There was a storm at destination so we ended up staying on the Siem reap airport tarmac waiting.  These things happens...  Other than that, it was a very pleasant flight.<br><br>On our trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, we flew 3 times total with Vietnam Airlines and I recommend them."
719,Craig C,2,We flew on Vietnam air several times over the course of a couple weeks Every flight we flew on didn't even start boarding until the departure time. They also cancelled one flight within 4 hours of departure. I'd choose another airline if there are options.
719,annablast,5,"Comfortable plane.  Good and helpful stewardess and stewards.  Short flight but ok. The airport at Danang is not great, and the announcements were of course in several languages and often difficult to hear.  <br>There are two air lines similar in name but the ground crew easily notices and points out that you are in the incorrect line.  EVeryone was courteous."
719,JohnKBachmann,5,From Hong to Hanoi on an A320.  <br>From pre boarding through the flight and baggage delivery in Hanoi everything went smoothly.<br>Purchase your ticket from Vietnam Airlines direct rather than using a travel service and save the commission!<br>Also remember to have your visa beforehand to cut down on any travel delays or cancellations.
720,Keri J,5,"Comfortable flight to Da Nang from Hanoi. We got asked if we felt comfortable to sit in the emergency seats. (who wouldn't, because the extra legroom was great.) Refresher towel and free water before take off and again upon descent. It was a rather empty flight so hubby got to move to another row and have a quick kip. Airline staff are polite and helpful. Would definitely fly Vietnam Airlines again."
720,54doc,5,"Vietnam airlines was amazing no hassle at check in no flight delay ( on our flight )<br>free movies on the back of the seats, free food and drink ,great air hostages, highly recommended"
720,stopdropnroll,5,I had no idea we would be flying on this carrier. They codeshare with another airline. The plane's interior was actually beautiful. The in-flight service was smooth and gracious. The food was delicious and visually stunning. It was such a treat to fly with them I didn't want to disembark LOL! I'm looking forward to flying with them again.
720,Xing M,4,"Flew from Da Nang, Vietnam to Siem Reap, Cambodia, via Ho Chi Minh. Arrived at Da Nang early and went to VA help desk too ask a question about checked baggage, and they offered me a seat on a flight leaving in 20 minutes time at no extra cost(and four hours before my actual flight), allowing me a decent buffer for transfer at Ho Chi Minh. Due to boarding within 20 minutes, a VA assistant helped me get to the front of the check-in queue, my baggage marked as priority, and then escorted me through security which had a VERY long queue, enabling me to get straight through a special channel. Made the boarding with 5 minutes to spare. Both flights departed on time arrived on time. Safe and comfortable. No meals due to such short flights (around an hour each) but free bottles of water were given out. Would definitely fly with them again."
720,r p,5,"The reviews I had read for Vietnam Airlines were mixed, however a lot were for Business Class and I was due to fly in Economy. This was at the suggestion of our U.K. travel agent; we were due to do several flights in Veitnam Cambodia and Laos;  there was a price advantage if we used Vietnam Airlines from London and on our trip.<br>Like me he was over 6 feet tall and assured me there would be adequate legroom. There was. I think more than on the B.A. flight I recently used to Mauritius. The seat was comfortable although, Premium Economy would be worth considering to get extra width.   <br>A lot depends on expectations. The Gin and tonic was mixed for us and not wonderful, the local beer however was very good. The Asian menu was better than the European.<br>The staff were charming attentive and competent. The Aircraft a new Dreamliner, quite spacious, very clean.  <br>On arrival the telescopic handle of my suitcase was damaged. A lot of concern was shown by ground staff ,who arranged for it to be collected and a temporary repair made, the same day.<br>On return to the U.K. the  cost of the travelite suitcase, purchased for the trip refunded.<br>All internal flights and the return to Heathrow very satisfactory."
721,AJ O'Grady,4,"This was the second time I had flown Vietnam Airlines to Vietnam. Vietnam Airlines is a first class airline carrier. Modern planes, good inflight entertainment, good quality food and excellent service makes flying with Vietnam airlines a joy. We flew Sydney to Ho Chi Min City internationally and HCMC to Danang domestically and returned via Hanoi with always the same professional and courteous service."
721,Sarahkreeves,5,"This is the second time that I have flown with Vietnam Airlines and it was just as enjoyable as the first time. All the long haul flights have pods, and the business class service as excellent. The food was good and the cabin crew took very good care of us. If you have a long lay-over in Vietnam the airline will pay for you to be transferred to a 4 star hotel for the duration, with a meal included and for a day's lay-over, a free tour of the city. The cost at the time of flying was the same price as premium economy on other flights, and the only issues are the number of flights from Melbourne and the connection to other countries. If you have the time this airline is worth considering."
721,nicptan,4,"Flew the carrier about 15 years ago and had a lot of negative things to say but they have certainly cleaned up. Food, entertainment, seating and staff were all great - had a very pleasant experience with minimal delay."
721,Tony Shepherd,4,"the food could do with a make over the same 3 open faced sandwiches greeted me on a morning flight a few weeks earlier, my big problem is the People who take off their shoes or leave them on and put their filthy feet up against the head board, it is a disgusting Pesant habit and the Air Crew should tell, them NO, aircraft are a flying disease dispenser and this is not helping god know where the shoes have been, otherwise I much prefer VN to Vietjet But More Discipline on Health and Hygiene PLEASE"
721,Rhysie T,1,"Booked a direct flight to Nha Trang well in advance with a 3 hour stopover in Ho Chi Minh city to allow enough time for my connecting flight, only for the airline to change my schedule twice and reduce my stopover time to 50 minutes. <br><br>After advising the airline of my connecting flight and the short stopover time they advised they would have staff support us in making our connecting flight. We had to wait for 50 minutes to collect our luggage and we missed our flight. The staff member waiting for us said nothing during this time, and simply walked us to the info desk before telling us we missed our flight, shrugged her shoulders and then walked off. <br><br>My wife and I had to spend the night in Ho Chi Minh city before taking the 5.45am flight the next day and forfeiting the first night of accommodation we had paid for in Nha Trang. <br><br>Terrible and disorganised airline. Complete garbage"
722,Kelvin,4,We made two internal flights with Vietnam Airlines - this one and then another between Da Nang and Ho Chi Min.  Both times the flights and service were good.  We used the lounge in Hanoi which was fairly standard for local airline lounges.  The aircraft were modern and clean and the service in flight was good.
722,futon333,4,"&gt; Tokyo -&gt; Hanoi -&gt; Singapore round trip flight with family (1 yr old) on Economy<br><br>&gt; Seats were comfortable, not too tight // Clean planes // above average food<br><br>&gt; Great service - very kid friendly &amp; helpful cabin attendants <br><br>&gt; No delays // Long check-in queue @ Haneda so give yourself time (could not self-check-in @ kiosk)<br><br>&gt; Transfers via Vietnam // Visa Requirements -&gt; watch out for this:<br>- Depending on your citizenship, you can't enter the country more than once within a 30-day window.  <br>- Give our transfer was overnight (on their national flag carrier), you would think that you are allowed to stay in a hotel overnight but this is not the case. <br>- If you plan on transferring in Vietnam (within 30 days), I would make sure to check with the Visa requirements.  <br>- We would not have been able to enter the country on our return trip (would have been stuck with our baby @ the airport overnight) had it not been the immigration official being kind enough to give us an exception."
722,wombidog,5,First time flights with Vietnam Airlines. Sydney_Ho Chi Minh_Hanoi_Paris and then return London HCM Hanoi Sydney. Excellent service and friendly staff all the way. Lounges were very good and the transit program provided in HCM on the return flight due to the lengthy layover was excellent. Will definitely fly VA again.
722,Paddy1912,3,"I was very disappointed with both the check-in and inflight service on my flight, as a full service airline I expected more.<br>1st of all the self checkin a Ho Chi Minh City didn't work and the staff were of no help.<br>Our cabin female cabin attendant was down right rude and didn't want to be there, I have had better and more friendly service on budget airlines."
722,FLORENCE75017,3,We had 2 flight problems during our vacations... first from Hanoi To Hue (2 hours delay wé changed our flight and had To buy business class To finally take off even later. No one ever relied To me...) And nos worth flight from siem reap To hanoi with a connecting flight To Paris. No information. Nobody gave informations and we were treated like animals. It is a shame. We travel a lot with all different  national compagnies I have never seen that before even a low cost company...
723,PaulienSutherland,5,I always fly Vietnam Airlines to Vietnam.  It is the only airline which does not have a long lay over in another country.  I mean anything up to 14 hours is just too long.  There is a wait at Ho Chi Minh to change planes when travelling to Hanoi but never over 2 hours.  You can also take 40KGS yes that's right 40KGS booked luggage on an economy flight.  If you need internal flights within Vietnam they are cheaper if you already booked international with Vietnam Airlines.  I can't fault it.
723,Laura R,1,"rude customer service, very abrasive towards foreigners.<br>pretended we didnt exist, or acted like it.<br>the flight itself was average but the absolute poor treatment was undeserved and unexpected"
723,Gfiles8,1,"We've had a couple of flights on Vietnam Airlines and they have both been equally disappointing. Staff are rude and inattentive both at check in and during the flight. Check in at Hanoi took a long time and is an unusual process meaning people easily wait a long time, become late and are pushed through while other flights are left waiting making them late and needing to be pushed through, a vicious cycle. The planes are old and flights were late, however boarded all passengers so we were left waiting in a hot plane on the tarmac. We would avoid flying with the carrier again and wouldn't recommend."
723,AndrewMyers1,4,"Rated by professionals in industry as safe airline as had checked.<br>Good booking through airline,good films on 787 planes and great service to Hue and Da Nang<br>Vege food good on out journey but desperately poor on re turn but all airlines similar.<br>They were good price,and safe,"
723,Vayu43,4,"Was surprised at the excellent service .Punctual ,on time departure ,arrived early at Hanoi.Service was excellent ,courteous ,friendly.Food was good .Had asked for Indian non veg ,got exactly that and without hassle. Was served wine along with lunch . On landing the luggage retrieval was easy and quic."
724,Business_Arvil,4,I have requested for More Leg Spaces and that has been granted. Moreover they also served Veg. Food of Intl Standard to enable traveler to having something in their stomach  .<br><br>Check In experience and on board experience is also as expected. Checked in baggage is also deliver on time.
724,BigglesandBadger,4,"Inevitably delayed in Shanghai (is this the worst airport in the world for delays?) the airline itself was very good. Food, in particular, was excellent and the service attentive, friendly and efficient. In flight entertainment is ropey though! Lounge in Hanoi is much superior to lounge in Shanghai (which is really pretty poor) - sadly also used by Virgin who should look to offer something much better really!"
724,TheShis,3,"While our numerous flights with Vietnam Airlines were basically OK, there was nothing special about it.<br>It's just an average airline with a sub-par business class product for medium and long haul flights."
724,morselover,2,"I'm not happy with this airline. They cancelled a flight meaning I had to stay 9 hours at Ho Chi Minh waiting for my connection ( which should have been a couple of hours). It also meant missing the end of my honeymoon as I left my nice luxury hotel at 9 am instead of late afternoon.<br>I might have felt more forgiving if they were nice, nut I found attendants rude and unfriendkybon the whole. On our flight, three toilets stopped working and the food was dreadful. <br>I wouldn't use them again"
724,Lauren H,1,"I travel frequently and have to say that this is the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. They left my luggage behind in London and forwarded it on 6 days late. When I received the luggage, a handbag had been stolen from inside it. They told me they were not liable since the airline policy is only to provide compensation when the luggage weighs less on arrival than on departure. Mine weighed 2kg more...clearly an error on check in which meant that they refused to pay up. The staff don't speak good English and I spent three hours at the airport trying to resolve the problem only to be told that I'd get $30 in compensation for the late arrival of my bag. They also refused to pay back all receipts that I presented for costs incurred to me as part of late arrival of luggage (which were reasonable). Finally - waited more than two hours to check in at Heathrow due to incompetence of ground staff. There are so many airlines to choose from with much better customer service. This airline doesn't deserve your hard-earned money. I won't use them again that's for sure - lost two passengers when all it would have taken was a bit of empathy and good customer service.  Awful."
725,snowboardingbec222,2,"I realise you do not expect a gourmet meal when flying Economy, but not one meal was edible. (we flew 4 sectors). The attendants on the planes didn't seem very happy, and the check in desk in Da Nang told us emergency exit seats were only for children!!  Heaven help us if we crashed. 1 piece of luggage was missing on arrival in Melbourne, but a QANTAS staff member assisted us and the package was delivered to us the following evening. We will fly Vietnam Airlines again as it is convenient, but we will not rely on the in-flight service."
725,Richard,4,"This is the second time we flew with the airline.<br><br>Pros :<br>1) Had to cancel a ticket.  They were very efficient and received the refund minus the admin. charges within 3 days.<br>2) Flight was on time and the in-flight service was satisfactory with minor hiccups.<br>3) Seats and the entertainment system on the Airbus 330 was satisfactory.<br>4) Price was good.  Food serve was satisfactory.<br><br>Cons :<br>1) The queue at the departure gate was a bit chaotic.  The staff was unable to get the passengers to queue properly.<br>2) The Korean immigration card given in the plane was in Korean.  Had to ask for the English version.  I guess they assume we were Koreans.<br><br>Would recommend this airline to other travellers.  Will book with this airline again.  No major complain, only a few insignificant ones."
725,Greg C,2,Hanoi lounge excellent. Da nang lounge revolting dirty unfriendly and unacceptable. Vietnam airlines should be ashamed of this lounge and its staff. Flights ok outdated seats on planes. Not worth the money for business.
725,Trevor N,2,"Though in truth that's pretty much it for the good points. Booked mine as a tour so I can't talk about price, but I hope they were cheap. <br><br>Service, particularly on the long haul flights was very poor. Video entertainment consoles on two of our three seats didn't work and there was nothing they could do (which is a real pain on a 12 hour flight). Food was not great, but it's the service that it all comes down to in the end. Very poor bordering on surly, makes all the other problems seem so much worse. <br><br>I genuinely felt they couldn't give a damn, which is so unlike Vietnam.<br><br>Internal flights were ok and as I said broadly on time. If I go back to Vietnam, which is a truly wonderful country, I will fly with anyone else regardless of cost or convenience!"
725,Roxi85,1,"Vietnam Airlines has an obscure way of showing their ""attentive and dedicated"" attitude that is announced in their commercial videos. We experienced a very rude and  disrespectful manner of he manager of the ticketing counter. First the person at check-in provided us with a lower price for an upgrade, which we decided to take instead of the emergency exit seats. Therefore we had to go over to the booking counter. Here the price was almost double for an upgrade, which was too expensive for us. Of course we lost our emergency exit seats meanwhile. We tried to talk to the manager of the ticketing/check-in because they sent us back at the end of the long check-in line.  The manager was not interested to help us in any constructive way, she apparently gave us emergency exit seats and ensured us twice that those are emergency exit seats although they were not. And I am pretty sure she was able to read the seat map.  We were offered a complaint form/ email address but until now, never got a reply back. We were willing to pay more money for an upgrade but the way they treated a paying customer and finally lying at us on purpose is a no-go, same for not even replying to a complaint."
726,Bob C,5,"Phnom Penh to HCM, HCM to Bangkok, Hanoi to Singapore.<br><br>Efficient operation. Friendly and helpful at airport check counter, gate, and on plane. On time leaving and arriving. <br>Exceeded expectations. Great value moving around SE Asia."
726,JulesBrad71,3,Firstly thanks for a comfy safe flight. Just wanted to feedback that compared to many other airlines the cabin atmosphere was very unfriendly. Two of the cabin team were rude during the flight which may be down to a culture difference but considering I was trying to help with the rubbish was a little annoying. Your competitors provide a massively warmer flying environment especially when flying premium. We saved to upgrade so it was a little disheartening.
726,Andrew W,4,"Vietnam Airlines is trying hard and they've got some cheap airfares out there in Business Class. Is it worth the 'risk'? Yes, it was pretty good and for some good comfort and a proper flat bed, it's very good value. They were cheaper in Business Class to HKG from Sydney than QANTAS premium economy so why not? <br><br>Flight departed late from Sydney by about 2 hours with no explanation. This screwed a lot of connections for a lot of passengers - more on that later.<br><br>Flat bed is very good. It is an industry leading product of 1-2-1 configuration, similar seat to Cathay but doesn't work quite as well on a more narrowbody 787. Nonetheless, it is comfortable. Cabin was light and bright. Passenger mix was mostly all westerners taking advantage of the cheap prices. Economy was completely full and mostly Vietnamese.<br><br>Cabin crew English was excellent and made a genuine effort to do a great job. Food was nothing special but was good and a good selection of drinks including some signature cocktails. Entertainment was not great but you could probably find a couple of movies and TV shows to keep you entertained. Washrooms were tidy throughout the flight. Pilots made some announcements during the flight.<br><br>So we land into SGN about 2.5 hours late which killed the connections of quite a few passengers. Of course we know that the real test of an airline is when things go wrong. What preparations would they have made upon our arrival? Would it be a smooth recovery a la Singapore Airlines or would it be a mess like a Chinese airline? It was somewhere in between.<br><br>We landed at a remote stand and had to take a bus... not a great start. There were some employees waiting in the hallway with a sign for BKK and HKG amongst other connecting flights. We were told to wait to the side of the hallways until all other passengers for HKG were collected. Of course, coming from Business Class, this was a bit frustrating - why pay to get off the plane first only to be held back waiting for everyone else? All 6 misconnected passengers for HKG were gathered after 15 minutes and we were then 'escorted' about 20 metres down the hall to join the queue at the transfer desk. That was pretty stupid. I could have just joined the queue myself. They then herded all the HKG passengers to one side of the desk and told us to wait. We then watched all the fights, frustrations, queues and mismanagement of all the other misconnected passengers. HKG passengers were told to wait and we were going onto Cathay Pacific and we were waiting for Cathay rep. At least I knew I was being reprotected on another airline and didn't have to fight for that.<br><br>Cathay rep was amazing and did business class passengers first. He provided us boarding passes, applied frequent flyer numbers and assured us that our bags would be manually found and re-tagged onto the Cathay flight 2 hours later.  He was great but Vietnam Airlines could have done a lot more to take the stress out of the situation. Cathay was amazing as usual and bags did arrive!<br><br>Return flight was an A321 from BKK to Hanoi. Airport services were good. Lounge in BKK was Thai Airways which was decent. Inflight service was excellent and I was the only passenger in business class and extra impressed when they sent a single van to pick me up instead of leaving me with the economy passenger bus. Lounge in Hanoi was very crowded, bad food but tolerable for a short stop. Flight on the 787 was excellent with an even better crew and tasty food although the signature Pho dish in the morning was really boring.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely fly VN again for a longer haul flight to Europe and would love a stop over as well. They have some amazing prices in business class and from a hard product point-of-view, very hard to go wrong on a flight operated by the 787 or A350. I was amazed to see the level of investment and number of aircraft on the tarmac. Well done VN!"
726,Darrilyn G,2,"So this July I thought I would go with my family from Sydney Australia to Europe. It is a long way but Vietnam Airlines seemed to offer reasonable value in Premium Economy 2200 AUD for 3 of us and 2800 for the 4th. So I did my due diligence. Premium economy offers wider seats which almost lie flat. I checked with a travel agent and we were booked. Premium economy has 2 seats on the right side - A and C. The leg from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city was great. Exactly as promised. We thought we had done well BUT inexplicably and without notifying us or our agent they changed the aeroplane on the leg from Ho Chi Minh to Paris (VN11). We now had the following:<br>1. 3 seats instead of 2 on the right side <br>2. These seats were in the same place as the 2 on the previous flight so they were narrower<br>3. A stranger was plonked between us.<br>4. The stranger had an economy boarding pass<br>5. The seats did not recline beyond the limited recline of economy.<br>So I stood up and looked back and yes, just as you suspect. All the row behind us looked exactly like ours. After an excruciatingly uncomfortable flight to Paris I complained to the airline and was told the aeroplane had changed but we were in the correct seat numbers (which technically was true) and this was premium economy.<br>So BEWARE. You have been warned. A narrow economy seat squashed next to a stranger without the ability to recline (ie an economy seat like any other) is considered PREMIUM ECONOMY on some of their planes and they will NOT refund you for that leg. So..there is one born every minute and I was that one. This was the most expensive economy flight I have ever taken but apparently there is small print that they can change the seat or the plane or anything else and you should basically consider yourself jolly lucky to have been flown where you wanted to go at all!"
726,Rusma,4,Its the only direct flight from Jakarta and the price is quite cheap for national carrier. The legroom is okay but no inflight entertainment. The food served is vietnamese dish and they also served beer and wine for us.
727,Ken H,5,"We flew on Vietnam Airlines on four occasions on our recent trip to Vietnam.We were pleasantly surprised with there punctuality and level of service, even during a flight from Phu Quoc to Saigon in monsoonal weather. Couldn't fault them. Even had more leg room than Aussie domestic carriers."
727,Kanhavy,2,"Yes we love their plan but staff at the check counter very rude when i asking him does they changed the gate to check in ? He said he dont know with crazy face and when i say sorry ? He say very loud that ""i said i dont know"" i almost missed the flight coz of him"
727,Cliford H,4,Good Service from all members of staff. Comfortable and spacious seating. Food consisted of an open sandwich which was ideal on this short haul flight
727,Warby,4,This service is very reliable. Check in is quick and efficient as was boarding. On time arrival and quick collection of bags<br><br>Flight steward service goos
727,Brigid M,5,"Flew Sydney to Frankfurt return with stopovers in both directions in Ho Chi Minh city for 6.5 and 13.5 hrs. Paid $3400 for the return business class fare. It is excellent value for the price. U use the Sky Lounge in Sydney Airport &amp; Vietnam Airlines bus lounge in Ho Chi Minh &amp; Luftahnsa lounge in Frankfurt. You can get a transit visa and a stopover at a hotel &amp; meals in Ho Chi Minh for stopovers longer than 6 hrs which the airline provides. They also take you out on a city tour if its over 9 hr between flights. Nearly all the food was good to very good. Should buy some champagne glasses for serving the champagne, not wine glasses. Crew are polite but sometimes you have to ask more than once for something. Toilets are kept clean. Flat beds are not bad. Boarding is pretty good. Entertainment is ok. Not an Emirates or Singapore Airlines offering. We would use again given the price."
728,Alclaire_11,5,I agree whole heartedly with gailc00 who has just recently reviewed Vietnam Airlines. We flew from Melbourne to Paris return and we were very pleased with the flight. It depended what you chose to eat off the menu as I ordered the Duck twice and I didn't think it was very good on both occassions but wife was very happy with the food that she ordered.The Business Class lounge in Ho Chi Ming is very good with a lovely array of food and constantly being cleaned by the staff.<br>The schedualling of the flights is a bit of a problem as the long lay overs are ok the first time but you wouldn't take this flight if you flew regularly.<br>From Paris to Ho Chi Ming we flew Air France and that flight was probably a bit better than the Vietnam Airlines flight.<br>Over all we thought that Vietnam Airlines were excellent and we flew with them because of the very low price they were offering but we would certainly fly with them again
728,Dan B,4,"Check-in easy but there was hardly anyone at the airport in Phu Quoc. Departed late as the aircraft was late coming in, but arrived more or less on time. Sandwiches and drinks available. No in-flight entertainment but the flight time was only 1hr50mins so shouldn't be an issue. Comfortable on board and smooth flight. No complaints"
728,James T,4,"We flew from Heathrow to Hanoi and Saigon to Heathrow and paid for a premium economy upgrade through Optiontown. I can 100% recommend doing this as the premium economy seating is very luxurious and much better than the option on offer through BA, Virgin etc. <br><br>On the flight out my partners in flight entertainment system was not working so we were moved through to business class. Can't complain at that! <br><br>The only aspect the airline falls down on is the in-flight food and drink. It's ok but not great and the staff are not very forthcoming with drinks and nothing left out to snack on during the flight."
728,montydb,3,"Vietnam Airlines is now flying the new 787 Dreamliner on the Australia to Vietnam route.<br><br>We were advised that this is a very comfortable plane. There are two problems with the Vietnam Airlines version First, there is a small control panel on the top of the arm rest right where you rest your arm. I found I was regularly accidentally activating the seat light but worse the attendant call button. Some time into the flight I noticed that there were about 12 call lights turned on around the cabin and the attendants no longer took any notice. This is a serious concern and needs attention by the airline. Second, there is reasonable leg room but the seat width is minimal and not suitable for larger people.<br><br>I am not sure how the airline and the manufacturer can address this."
728,Leanne E,3,"We flew from Heathrow to Hanoi on the new dream liner which is a fabulous plane. Our flight departed at about 11.20am UK time for an 11h30min flight duration. The food we had within an hour of taking off was nice. We then didn't receive another meal until near the end of the flight. They were bringing out snacks for people on request during the flight. There was no snack menu for us to choose something.  We asked for some instant noodles  as we had seen someone else had some and the attendant said no, we are not doing those anymore. She then gave me a very small packet of pretzels. There must have been at least 8 hours without serving food or drinks to us. They treated it like a night flight due to the time zone changes but we had only had breakfast and not many people slept because it was technically the middle of the day for us.  It just seemed really silly that the flight attendants spent most of the flight running up and down the cabin responding to hungry passengers when it would have made more sense to serve a meal and drinks in between. The flight attendants seemed annoyed at the number of call buttons pressed by passengers. What was strange was that those who had put in a special meal request recieved 3 meals but the rest of us only had 2. We were so hungry, we would have gladly paid for food but that wasn't an option. The movies and music stopped working about 5 hours into the flight for everyone on the right hand side of the plane. They couldn't say why and it never came back on. I was really excited prior to flying VA to read they are aiming to become a 5 star airline but I'm afraid they have a long way to go to achieve this. Luckily my return flight is at night and I'm going to take a packed lunch with me just in case."
729,cas1978,5,A great airline. Had two flights all left on time or early. Aircraft modern and clean. Staff easy to deal with.   Also used Vietjet Air who were 90 mins late departing and boarding was a nightmare via a bus and the onboard experience was like terrible. L
729,Jenny R,1,"I flew with flight no. VN 10 from Paris back to HK.<br>I am Thai, holding Thailand passport with work permit to live in HK<br>I travel to HK with Schengen visa issued in HK and that means I live in HK and that's how I get the visa from HK<br>1. I have the right to fly to HK as I live her and my work permit shows that I live there legally until the end of 2018<br>2. even I don't have anything to prove i live in HK, my passport will allow me to live in HK as a tourist for 30 days<br>3.

I was lucky enough to meet the other manager guy who was kind enough to check my passport and allowed me to check in.<br><br>Jennifer is a horrible manager, I don't know how she could be a manager with that attitude and knowledge but she is not supposed to be a manger for an international airline.<br><br>I hope your airline could improve this and do something.<br>I will keep complaining until you do something with this.<br><br>Jenny"
729,gailc000,5,"We travelled from Melbourne to Paris and return and enjoyed the business class service and facilities provided by Vietnam airlines. The staff were friendly, the planes were new and importantly it was very good value for money. The price was much less than other airlines for business class service. <br>The layovers in Saigon are longer than would be ideal, however Vietnam airlines are working hard to work with this logistic. The departure times of the flights are convenient . On our forward flight, leaving Mel at 11am , we travelled during the day . The flight was a little late arriving at Saigon , so we had a five hour wait in the Saigon airport. Vietnam airlines had offered a hotel room, but with we decided to wait at the airport, using the lounge . It was ok . We continued to Paris leaving late in the evening, taking full advantage of the lay flat beds . <br>On the return flight , leaving Paris at 1pm, we arrived in Saigon at 6am, - again taking advantage of flat beds . The Vietnam staff met us and organised short-stay visa. We needed photos - this cost five dollars per person if you didn't have one, otherwise there was no additional cost . It took about 45 minutes to obtain the visas. There were about 18 people from our flight who took advantage of the short stay visa during the 14 hour layover at Saigon. We were bussed to a hotel (the Ramana), and given a room and were able to have a shower, sleep etc . Lunch and dinner were provided at the hotel by by Vietnam airlines and A city tour was provided. At 1.30 pm we were offered a city tour -We were picked up by a bus and taken to the Saigon city, stopping at the War remnants museum , - and at a handicrafts demonstration -lacquerware, . We were driven past the palace, cathedral, post office, Ho Chi Minh monument etc with the tour guide providing a commentary. Watching the scooters, motorbikes , cars, traffic, electrical wires , people - all provided a visual Experience. Back to the hotel and able to freshen up in the hotel room again. <br>The bus picked us up at 7pm for the return trip to the airport and we took a 9.30pm flight to Melbourne. We arrived at 8.30 am . <br>The food on the flights  was excellent. The movies were good. A travel kit is provided - I use the socks, toothbrush, moisturiser and the scuffs. I was able to recharge my iPad at my seat. But the best aspect is the lay flat bed. The layover in Saigon certainly helped manage the jet lag issue. <br>The business class section is not too large - as on other airlines. I wouldn't recommend the first row - too busy and too noisy. Overall Vietnam airlines are offering a good alternative  for the long haul to Europe. The rest permitted during the layover has really helped avoid jet lag, and make journey more enjoyable."
729,vivianne17,5,Staffs are nice. Food and drinks are well above average. Not experienced any delay at all. Seats are quite comfortable.
729,irwinmob,4,"Great value, travelled in business, seats were comfortable, huge amount of room, Service was efficient as flight not long, both flights on time without delay in either direction. Absolutely recommend and would fly again, thanks Vietnam Airlines!!"
730,Saket G,4,"I traveled through this airline. The aircraft was clean, with spacious seats esp. leg room. The airhostess and steward were very courteous and provided extra bread on request since I was vegetarian. Clear communication from pilot and instructions from cabin crew provided. There was no entertainment on this flight of 2 hr."
730,Jason C,1,"I booked a return flight from Sydney to London and took Vietnam Airlines as I was flying with 2 young children (10 mo and 4yo) and I was intrigued by the airlines offer to pay for our visas, and offer a hotel room, meal vouchers and city tour since the stop over in Ho Chi Minh was 15 hours.  I was also excited as the planes were new 787s and thought this would be a no brainer and told everyone about it.<br><br>BOY WAS I WRONG AND WHAT A TERRIBLE AIRLINE AND AIRPORTS!!!  When we checked into our first flight, we asked the ground staff if we needed any voucher or confirmation for the tour etc and they just said it will be taken care of at landing.  We landed in Ho Chi Minh and our names aren't on their list and turns out they screwed up and didn't book us on the tour.  However worst part is that this also means we don't have a visa so can't leave the airport and have to stay here for 15 hours from 6am til 9pm.  <br><br>IT GETS WORSE WHEN I ASK their customer service for help as my son is EXTREMELY anaphylactic to dairy nuts and eggs and can't eat at most places.  Also asked if they could help find a place for the family to rest and they just told us to fend for ourselves.  I'm so angry they couldn't do a thing for us and we even flew business on this trial to splurge with the little ones while my wife was finishing up maternity leave.  There are so many great airlines that fly to London, Etihad, Emirates, Singapore, Cathay, I will NEVER fly you again"
730,Vivutravel,5,"I flew to Bangkok with Vietnamairlines, and very satisfied. Flight was on time, and the food served during the flight was delicious."
730,Gandalfquest,2,Economy seat - large leg room and great new 787 aircrafts. The only drawback is the remote control on the side seats if you are not careful you end up pressing the light or flight attendant light which is annoying<br><br>Inflight entertainment - Mediocre- very few selections and old movies. Cannot use your own earphones. <br><br>Food - London to Ho Chi Minh very average if not poor. HCMC to Honk Kong average <br><br>Service - compared to other major airlines flight attendants require further service and language training. None of the flight attendants put a single smile in our 12 hours journey. <br><br>Web Check-in more than an hour in HCMC
730,SingBob,4,"Excellent value 4 star biz class. Lie flat in biz class in 1-2-1 config on a brand new 787.  Good length but a little narrow (a little like CX long haul). the 787 is a fabulous plane, you really do notice the extra cabin pressure and humidity on a long haul. In flight entertainment system was excellent but content a little limited, although with a quirky mix of old Vietnamese war movies thrown in. Food was good, as was the wine. Lounge in HAN was OK. LHR is the skyteam lounge which like most things from that alliance is average at best. Airport is brand new and uncrowded so easy transit (as is SGN). Biz class check in fast and efficient."
731,ankush b,4,Overall very good experience with the airlines. Flights were on time and food was delicious. <br><br>Price wise its better than the budget airlines.<br><br>Cons - they should add meal selection during the booking process.
731,M_Lindegaard,5,"Having compared all airlines on this route, the total cost of Vietnam Airlines was again the cheapest. Always remember to take luggage weight and amount into consideration, plus additional fees. We tried VietJet earlier but the waiting lines additional cost etc. just made this more expensive and annoying."
731,arlenekelly4,2,"Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience with Vietnam airlines. Our flight from Sydney to Vietnam was delayed on the way their, causing us to rush through the airport to ensure we didn't miss our connecting flight. As well as this, on the way from Sydney to Vietnam AND returning from Vietnam to Sydney, the inflight entertainment on our seats was down so I was left staring at a blank screen for 8 hours. Our return trip home was delayed by an hour, meaning that we were once again rushed to our Sydney-Auckland connecting flight however our bags didn't make it. We are still waiting to hear of there where abouts. Not how you want your trip to end."
731,mrsmross,5,"On our way from Beijing to Cambodia we had one stop in Vietnam by flight. Both flights were Vietnam Airlines. When we were checking in, the staff were taking a lot of time due to that our connecting flight were cancelled. At the time we were upset about losing one day of our vacation, stranded in some airport hotel. To our luck Vietnam Airlines made sure the stay was as pleasant as possible considering the circumstances. <br><br>The flights were clean and felt safe. Food was good."
731,Travel Expert.,3,"We flew many times in this airline, it is a good airline at this stage. The problem is their price are not consistence and the customer service far below their expectations.<br><br>We got very good online offers sometimes better than other budget airlines also they allow 20 KG checked luggage for domestic airlines this a very good plus point. They add almost one flight for each hour for popular destinations suddenly flight delay as they cancel the flights when there is not much much customers, this is a problem for the guest waiting to connect other flights as they have limited time and already booked the ticket.<br><br>Improve the customer service and give a good price all the time."
732,Tezza1965,4,"I paid for the option town upgrade after booking our flights and was surprised to learn at  check in that we both had actually been upgraded to Business Class. The flight was a lunch flight and it was really good. The champagne and drinks flowed and the food was overall pretty good. On our return from Hanoi to Singapore we were also upgraded again on a lunch flight. This flight was a bit delayed but the same again, the service and selection was pretty decent. We also had two domestic flights in economy. I think we were given some water and fruit as it was a short flight, but overall I was impressed and would definitely travel with them again."
732,p911turbo,2,"The staff members were busy texting and using their phones in the back room.  Most of them looked miserable.  Food should be covered because there were people sneezing and flies.  I wanted to eat the fruit until I saw flies inside the container dancing and then I changed my mind.  To to go the lounge, you need to conquer a flight of stairs first.  It is just ridiculous that they do not have an elevator."
732,Manxman2014,4,"Usually travel with Emirates but took this flight as the only direct option. I was pleasantly surprised flying on a new 787. Good entertainment package, food reasonable but if you want a drink, ask for a double as measures small. Not overly impressed with the lounge at Heathrow but on the return journey from Hanoi the lounge was better. Disappointed no wifi facilities onboard."
732,Nguyen L,3,"I fly VNA few times. The thing I like about VNA is that they a not very strict about luggage and carry-on. If your carry-on is little bit bigger or heavier, just explain to them and they could make exception for you. The frequent card is quite easy to get, 10.000 miles and you get titan card and a elite guest of Skyteam. <br><br>The other good thing is that they have movie with English subtitle. <br><br>Everything else is so-so. The seat is not very comfortable. Bathroom is also not very clean.<br><br>Service is not very professional but it is better than before. <br><br>Have a check-in online system, you should check-in beforehand to get a good seat."
732,Kazacos11,3,My husband and I booked return to Paris from Sydney and I have already reviewed an outstanding fight from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city. Sadly the 2 leg was a let down.  To begin with the lounge in Vietnam was less than ordinary. The fight was late  45 min with no updates or news which worried us as we had connections to Belgium.  Luckily they did make up the time delay. By comparison the A350 was not as pleasant as the Dreamliner. And a little grubby.<br>The staff were trying very hard obviously due to the delay with the exception of one lady fight Attendent.   The food was tasteless and compared to the excellent 1st fight the second was a disappointment.    Still 2 legs to go  ?
733,PhotoCatTraveler,4,"Used Vietnam Airlines to fly from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) airport.  It is about a 2 hour flight.  The flight was on time and the service was good.  The seats could use just a bit more cushion, especially in the back,  but was dine for a 2 hour flight."
733,Melinda D,5,"I had booked tickets to Paris with a stop over in Ho Chi Minh months ago. Then read some very negative reviews. I was apprehensive. From the check in staff to the fight times, condition and comfort of plane. the service and attitude of the staff, the meals and wines. I thought were all excellent.  I was so very pleased and look forward to our next 3 fights to Paris and home to Australia.  Well done Vietnam airlines."
733,mishimadam,3,"I really wanted to like Vietnam Airlines but frankly, my first and only experience with it is that I would never choose them again. Very poor communication starts with their website not making clear that you’ll be slogged a huge currency conversion fee because their payment provider is somewhere offshore. Then they don’t tell you whether or not your fare is eligible for a ‘transit tour package’ (ie. stopover hotel) and my emails to their Sydney office were ignored 50% the time. Check-in online was impossible, and so there was a heaving mass of people still checking in well past the 60-minutes-before-departure deadline at SYD and the flight arrived almost two hours late in SGN. As a  result anybody on certain connecting flights missed their international connections (resulting 18 hours in a Saigon airport lounge; without a potentially expensive, pre-arranged visa you are stuck in the airport!) Likewise, anybody trying to get their tax back (the tourist refund scheme or TRS) missed their opportunity (it cost me $505 lost).  No announcements or explanations of course; the captain’s English was unintelligible in any case; I had minimal faith in their ability to deal with anything that might’ve gone wrong. The 787 was nice and new but the economy chairs were wafer thin and you felt every object in the seat pocket behind. My IFE system kept crashing despite staff efforts to reboot. Not the airline for a stress-free booking &amp; flight experience."
733,DJD2012,1,"On February 16th my wife and I flew from Heathrow to Hanoi on Vietnam Airlines flight 54, seats 14a and 14c in order to visit Hanoi,  Cambodia  and then Ho Chi Minh City as part of a  Viking River Cruises Holiday. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is a relatively new design.<br><br>We paid an additional £700 per person upgrade cost to Viking for both outbound and inbound flights for an upgrade from Economy to Premium Economy in order that we could get some sleep on the long haul flight for both outbound and inbound flights. <br><br>On the outbound flight, window seat 14A was broken and could not be reclined. The cabin crew were unable to fix the seat, so because of defective maintenance on the part of Vietnam Airlines, my wife did not obtain the Premium Economy facility that was paid for.  <br><br>On the inbound journey, two of the three items of our checked in luggage were not labelled as priority, hence we experienced a long wait at Heathrow to recover our luggage, which incurred additional parking costs for the driver meeting us.   <br><br>Vietnam Airlines have ignored out letters requesting a refund and Viking Holidays have responded to letters but not refunded the money paid for a service we did not receive. Very poor service from both - would not use Viking again."
733,Philip L,4,"The flight was straight through from Heathrow to Hanoi. The service from start to finish was 1st class. Staff very friendly always wanting to help. The food was quite good. Booked well ahead, getting a very good price."
734,Puppet_mongoose,3,"Decided to fly from Phu Quoc to Phnom Penh rather than take the boat and bus. The flights were quite expensive, but did save a lot of time. The flight itself was fine, staff were friendly and helpful. Only issue we had was we had to change terminals and clear customs in hcm, but this was more of an issue with the travel agent not telling us when we booked."
734,Colin G,5,"Although flying is never really a pleasure these days, I have to say that Vietnam Airlines were brilliant when I was taken ill in Da Lat in March.  I was very efficiently trundled through Da Lat and Ho Chi Minh airports in a wheelchair.  Staff were helpful and sympathetic as well."
734,william hanlon b,5,"Returning to Vietnam for the 4th time, we always fly Vietnam Airlines.  We fine the staff, very friendly, professional and helpful at any time during the 8hr 10min flight.  We left Melbourne at 10: 35am, so we travelled in in our usual time zone.  This changed during flight of course arriving Ho Chi Minh at 3:35 the afternoon of the same day.  The meals are magnificent, with several choices.  The restrooms are always kept very clean, which is so important.  There is plenty of leg room, with lovely warm blankets and cosy pillows for your comfort.  Also plenty of locker space above.  During flight, water and cold or hot refresh towels are provided for your comfort.  The prices are always very competitive (we always book well ahead to get best prices) We would highly recommend Vietnam Airlines.  This was a direct flight aswell."
734,sheila934,5,i would not travel any other way now. the airline staff were impeccable and curtious and gave us whatever we asked for. excellent flight.
734,redbulllover,3,Flew with Vietnam Airlines on a couple of short one way internal flights (HCMC to Nha Trang and Nha Trang to Da Nang) which only lasted about an hour.<br><br>Customer service was a bit impersonal but flights were on time and got us from A to B. There seems to be some inconsistancy on the Lithium battery issue as when we departed HCMC to Nha Trang there was no mention about removing Lithium batteries from our hold luggage but in Nha Trang and Da Nang we had to (we were denied boarding at the gate at Nha Trang initially by VA as my husband accidentally left a battery in his suitcase and we had to go back down to check in to get it out and put in the hand luggage)
735,Amyrichardattwood,2,"Vietnam airlines when called to assist us with flight issues were exceptionally unhelpful, with a really DONT CARE attitude. Have never had such a bad experience with the contact us lines of an airline."
735,Lovelystopover,4,"We had never flown Vietnam airlines before, nor had anyone we knew but our travel agent assured us they were good. We flew to &amp; from Melbourne as well as another I think 3 internal flights. All were good. Meals of good standard. On the flights from Melbourne &amp; back we thought there was a little more leg room than on some airlines. This is good as we are no longer young &amp; it's hard to get comfortable. Overall, we would have no problem recommending Vietnam Airlines"
735,Rajnikant M,4,"Pleasant interior clean and tidy, more leg room aircraft, testy hot meal. change flight at Ho-chi mean city transfer was free of trouble. flight crews are very efficient and help full<br>i will fly with them again."

All Vietnamese crew, found captains English announcements and little hard to understand, offered refresher towel prior to takeoff, departed on time, bag of mixed nuts and drinks followed by headsets soon after takeoff. Standard in-flight entertainment provided by personal screen built into seat in front, very good selection of movies example, Lion and Star Wars (New Hope) plus others on our flight, and a good range music, both in English and Vietnamese. Beware your remote is built into arm rest and is easy to bump with  your arm accidentally turning on overhead light or worse calling a flight attendant. In flight meals were excellent, lunch and a refreshment prior to landing,our selections were, lunch, vegetable salad and prawn, beef goulash with mashed potato, bread roll and strawberry cheese cake, tea, coffee and juice. Good selection of beverage, non alcoholic, spirits and beer. Refreshment served prior to landing was grilled fish and potato, fresh fruit. We found the servings ample well presented and fresh on  recyclable plastic crockery. We also used Vietnam Airlines for two internal flights, Hanoi to Hue and Danang to HCM City, VN1545 AND VN113, both planes were A321's, with a 3x3 seat configuration. Both these economy flights were around one hour each on both flights we were given refresher towels and a bottle of water, no in-flight entertainment on either flight, landing in Hue both the front and rear exit doors were opened, we were then bused to terminal. Our return flight to Sydney was at night on a Boeing 787, same quality food as our outward flight, was served  supper and breakfast. We enjoyed all flights with this airline, the planes appeared to be well serviced with clean and modern interiors the toilets were kept clean and well stocked with toiletries on both international flights. Flight staff were efficient and friendly on all flights. Would certainly use this company again."
736,Chris E,5,another good flight experience with this airline<br>everything was very good and i would always recommend them
736,Chris E,5,"the service was that good, i thought i was in 1st class<br>the professionalism was amazing<br>very courteous and efficient cabin staff<br>softest take off and landing ever<br>great food<br>i have since chosen them again during this Asian trip"
736,Magpile S,4,"Accommodating staff, clean airplane, polite ground staff. The flight went as per schedule. Plane maneuvering, on take off and landing is smooth. comfortable seats."
736,Leon-Judy,5,"We paid the extra for premium Economy and it was well worth it. Love the Dreamliner. No problems, food and service were first rate. They give excellent support for disabled passengers even if informed at the last minute."
736,Julianne C,4,"Had an aisle seat on the side up near the front on the way up and an aisle in the middle on the way back.   I find on the side much better, personal preference<br>Im a chicken fish only eater and the meal offered was pork or beef. I would have thought that either one of my preferences would be available.  On return i ordered vegetarian and it was horrible and tasteless.   <br>The seat comfort was ok, The attendants were friendly.  <br>My flight was changed twice and late boarding on depart and return. <br>I traveled on the Dreamliner which was great. Direct flight which took 9 hours.  <br>Entertainment was great with up to date movies and an assortment of music."
737,Armando P,5,"Had the opportunity to flight VA for the first time, i was surprisingly helped very much to solve a visa problem i had prior to boarding. All this was beyond what they had to do and helped me to continue with my journey. The aircraft was clean and recently built, in spite of flying economy the food served on board was also tasty. Best it's fares were even better."
737,suzanj374,5,No queues at the check in desk. I had a window seat and plenty of leg room. The flight took off on time and the cabin crew were not overly friendly but they were polite and efficient. The food was fine and although the inflight entertainment could have provided a bit more choice I prefer to read so wasn't overly bothered. I would definitely fly with this airline again as I think their price for a direct flight from the UK to Vietnam is very good value for money!
737,Maureen A,5,"All flights including those internally  we took were punctual, very comfortable and with good meals and service.For the price they were exceptional value with a modern fleet of aircraft.the choice of films for western clients was a bit limited but they did offer Asian choices too."
737,rmpcv,3,"The plane was new and the flight was on time, which is always great.  On entering the plane, the on-board music was set to an uncomfortably loud volume, and the passengers talked very loudly to each other to be heard over the music, which is something Vietnam Airlines should fix as it is unpleasant and a somewhat stressful.   The flight itself was comfortable, but the seats hardly reclined at all, and the food wasn't great.  A piece of luggage was missing on arrival, and although delivered to my place 36 hours later, there was no communication at all from the airline about it.  Some  improvements could easily be made to improve the overall quality."
737,John d,4,"Direct flights to Vietnam are a real bonus and Vietnam Airlines offer really excellent value although facilities/services on flight are limited; no problems and everything was fine, comfortable enough for such a long flight (they accommodated our request for a row of 3 seats which gave more space for stretching out)"
738,Thảo N,5,"that flight was fine overall, i didnt got a long delay than other branch so i could say that flight was Ok for me. The staff were friendly and professionally they could support any you need in basic, depended on your class of  service. But i arrived to Ha Noi quiet late at midnight because of the bad weather. you know, at that time, the northern of VN usually have storm so make sure you prepare well for your trip. nice!"
738,mags666577,5,Everything worked well on both flights - changed planes in Saigon.  Priority check in and boarding was great.  Very hospitable cabin crew.  Wonderful seat which extended flat for sleeping.  Food good.  Good price.
738,JONHallettCove J,4,"My only problem with this fkight was of my own doing...I misread the deoarture time and had a miserable 10 hour wait in the external part of the terminal...facilities very basic.<br>However once inside and relaxed all good.<br>The flight left shortly ahead of time and we had a brilliant flight back to Melbourne,  The attendants were very friendly, the in-flight entertainment was good and I was lucky enough to have a vacant space next to me.<br>We had an early arrival and I would say the best ever approach and perfect landing at Tullamarine.<br>Flew all my internal flights with the same airline and upgraded to business class at a very reasonable rate and trust me it is so worth it!!<br>Good airline, good staff, food pretty good and the aircraft was clean and comfortable -  will use them again in August"
738,tonyhalik,1,"I checked in online got my mobile boarding pass couldn't go through as they need to check your passport, that took 7minutes just to check as we already checked in. on board we got disgusting looking food, no options just 1 type, no alcohol just orange juice coke, water and sprite"
738,Avachat110,5,"Friendly staff and flight attendants. You are looked after from the moment you book the flight. I have been flying with them for 10 years both to/from Melbourne and internal Vietnam hops along with stops in and out of Cambodia. I often sit with the attendants at the rear of the craft, speak pigeon Vietnamese with them over a beer or coffee, (night flights only). If you are new to them it pays to learn about their culture before hand. They are well dressed in their traditional style and will see to your needs quickly."
739,Tuddlebear,5,Comfortable economy seats and friendly helpful staff  had a great flight. Meals were good. A staff at ho chi minh  was waiting at the arrival hall to guide us to the domestic terimal which was very helpful.
739,Conor b,5,As part of our round to world trip we flew Hong Kong to Hanoi. As this was an under 3 hour flight we had booked economy and the service was brilliant.We were given towels refreshment and a full meal which was far more than expected. We would have no problem recommending Vietnam Airlines.
739,Alexander R,4,The flight itself was fine though. Vietnamese passengers are still learning how to travel by air so do expect some Shenannigans on board and at check in where orderly queues are unknown..
739,Manfred M,4,Flight was punctual and seats &amp; service were alright (economy class). Advantage of VN flight was the relatively short transfer time for the flight to Lao PDR.
739,Helmut1954,1,"I could not reach the airport in time.  I called the airline to take an alternative flight instead. They said they can not do.  I have to call the office of the ticket office where I booked the flight. This was NhaTrang office of Vietnam  Airlines. I could not reach them, 2hour lunch time. So I bought a flight to reach Ho Chi Minh. When I wanted to proceed with Vietnam Airlines to Nha Trang I had to buy a new ticket because this flight was cancelled  automatically. Any request to get a refund was rejected. The initial request I provided all particulars. They asked to repeat the particulars again and again. I was always referring to my initial request. <br>Finally  I paid twice for the same flight. Despite personally showing all the original booking references issued by Vietnam Airlines. Also the many emails did not help.  Policy is policy.<br>This is a 4 star service provided to a platinum member  of Vietnam Airlines"
740,jipod37,4,"Good fly, in time, good duration ,good service and meals quality; Staff Ok.Confort enough. Just better moovies choice  should be apreciated"
740,ricanstruction,5,"We booked a roundtrip from Saigon to Phu Quoc via Vietnam Airlines.  Although the flight was only an hour, the flight was great, comfy and without any boarding, seating and delay issues.  The best part was the price.  We paid about $70 usd roundtrip.  Not bad.  I'd definitely use Vietnam Airlines on my next trip within Vietnam."
740,RovingMe,5,"Well certainly puts western economy travel to shame, seats were very comfortable service was very good, staff took great care to make sure that everyone was comfortable and had everything they need although this was a long flight it went very quickly I would have no hesitation to fly this airline again and would choose over others."
740,ShurlockHomes,4,"Had the opportunity to use Vietnam Airlines during our recent trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and we actually used them 3 times during our trip. <br><br>VN834 Siem-Reap to Hanoi<br>VN173 Hanoi to Danang (used an Angkor Air Airbus on this route - leased)<br>VN123 Danang to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)<br><br>All flights utilised very modern aircraft, the Airbus A321 of which I believe they have around 60 on their fleet. All flights were taken in economy class. <br><br>One piece of advice is join their frequent flyer program (LotusMiles) in advance as that makes on-line check-in a little easier (allows you to join the bag drop queue only) and you also collect airmiles for your flights.<br><br>Every flight we took was on time and trouble free, easy boarding process. Good seats every time even though some of the flights were quite busy. The flight to Danang from Hanoi was particularly busy, I guess due to the fact this is a beach location.<br><br>Make sure you check in online as this makes checking-in a lot easier as you only have to do a 'bag drop' at the airport. The check-in queues as Hanoi were quite long but we skipped those by just doing a bag drop.<br><br>Simple and efficient service on board. <br>Drinks (water in bottles) was supplied.<br><br>Very happy with the service provided by Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>Note on LotusMiles:<br>They do seem a little slow in crediting the air miles for trips however. We have been back from holiday a week now and still nothing on our account, even though Thai Airways have credited all their air miles. I am in the process of chasing the LotusMiles frequent flyer club now to get my air miles credit via email."
740,moments,5,"First time traveling business class. Terminal 4<br>We chose Vietnam Airline as we wanted a direct flight and they are the only ones that do it from the UK. <br>We caught the train to London at teatime the day before and then got the tube to Heathrow and stayed near the airport for the night.<br>We got the tube to terminal 4 the next morning, everything worked out really well for us, no delays or anything. Everything easy to find.<br>Checking our bags in at both ends went smooth, no queues at business check in desks at Heathrow or Hanoi.<br>Our bags were first off at both ends too.<br>The flight was great, comfy seats that lay back, more or less in to a bed.<br>We were given a toiletry bag with eye mask, socks, and toiletries in. We had a blanket and pillow but I got a little cold on the way back so they brought me another blanket when I asked. The staff were very nice and helpful at all times.<br>Comfy ear phones were provided so you can watch the movies, or listen to music. T<br>Even though it was morning on the way out, the lights were dimmed not long after take <br>off. This gave the illusion of it being night so we slept quite a bit and neither of us suffered jet lag either way. <br>They brought us a glass of champagne as soon as we sat down and before take off both ways.<br>The menu going out was very nice and everything was served with real crockery not plastic, they even layed a little table cloth for you.<br>The menu coming back was not as nice so I skipped it and my other half left his. I woke up hungry and asked for a cup of tea and something to eat, which they arranged for me straight away.<br>We tried different drinks offered on the menu, and all were good.<br>The Sky lounge at Heathrow is better than the one at Hanoi, more food was available at Heathrow, there was barely anything at Hanoi which was a bit disappointing, as we had saved ourselves. Pho was being served but we did not fancy it, there was really nothing else to chose so we did not eat. This was the only disappointment for us and I do think for the price you are paying there should be more on offer at Hanoi.<br>One other thing, in the Sky lounge there was no announcement to go to the gate for our flight (other flights were being announced). We decided to have a stroll down and the gate was just closing.<br>We would definitely fly with Vietnam Airline again, we couldn't really ask for more."
741,Dave P,4,"The flight was good, with excellent lounge services. The staff were friendly, and they were really professional. The only thing that makes me rate 4 star because the seats were uncomfortable and the toilet are not really clean."
741,Doyleygirl,2,"We flew on the new Dreamliner to Vietnam, along with 3 internal flights, also Vietnam.   It was awful.  Never again will we book with them.  The seats were so uncomfortable, the food was disgusting and the service poor.  Added to that, they cancelled one internal flight without letting us know, so just as well we had turned up early.....and managed to get on another flight.  They also changed the times of one flight without letting us know.  Appalling.   We tried to up-grade our seats to return to UK in a bit of comfort, but they wanted to charge us more to up-grade to Premium, than the whole of our holiday flights in total.  It's usually just a few hundred pounds each.  A ridiculous airline which we will never use again."
741,JDHop,4,"I had never experienced flying Vietnam Airlines before and I can honestly say it was a very pleasant experience. <br>I travelled extensively throughout Vietnam with them and would definitely not hesitate to fly with them again. <br>All flights took off and arrived on time, the seats were comfortable, the food which was included was good and the staff were very accommodating.<br>If you haven't flown with them before definitely give them a go, good value for money"
741,Linda W,1,"We booked a Manchester to Saigon return flight with Air France.  Our return journey, via Hanoi was operated by Vietnam Airlines.  Seating was fine, as was the staff, but catering on board was diabolical.  Departing at midnight, our evening meal was served an hour or so later, with no choice other than a tiny piece of what we were told was fish.  A very small glass of wine was served with it, but no tea or coffee and no other drinks were brought around afterwards.  During the 13 hour journey, no other refreshments were provided until an hour or so before landing when breakfast was served.  Tea/coffee was promised to follow but, due to turbulence, lasting about five minutes, this was cancelled.  We have used Vietnam Airlines for domestic flights on many occasions and they have been ok.  There was no food on these but we didn't expect any on such short flights, however, on a long haul flight this is not acceptable and, as a result, we shall never again use Air France or Vietnam Airlines for flights into/out of Vietnam.  Take note those of you considering such a flight, and if you've already booked one take food/drink with you!"
741,ankit s,5,"Really really was surprised by the crew service, the quality of food, legroom and the entertainment. It really seemed like a luxurious flight at very low price."
742,kvetnata,3,"Average on every aspect. Chaotic boarding, delays. Mobile app is not functional - we couldn't finish the payment."
742,Robert B,4,"As this was a 12 hour overnight flight direct from London to Hanoi we opted to fly Business Class - might seem extravagant but it was so worth the extra cost - which was significantly less than we'd anticipated.  For us this was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime trip, taking in Vietnam, North to South, and crossing in to Cambodia and all the comfort, service and priority boarding that goes with flying Business Class made it all the more special.  Highly to be recommended if you're considering a similar itinerary."
742,Hai Ha,5,Reasonable price with the good service. <br>I booked the economy save tickets so it was cheap. The food on the flight is not realy diversifield but it tastes good. <br>Seats are clean and comfortable.
742,Giang T,5,"Luckily, my flight departed on time, as schedule.<br>The service is good. The crew includes Vietnamese and Korean.<br>I could entertain with range of films, music."
742,Mutsaer,4,I've already flown with Vietnam Airlines for more than 2 ~ 3 times to go to Bangkok. It's been always on time and even I arrived a bit earlier.
743,Stephen P,3,"Seat- I'm 6ft tall and could not stitch my legs fully when the chair was in sleep mode. I had to try and sleep on my side at an angle. It wasn't particularly comfortable and I wasn't able to sleep. If you were shorter you may be in a more relaxed position. I don't always want to sleep on flights but in this case, I wanted to but wasn't able to. <br><br>Entertainment- Very limited. My screen didn't swing out. I was offered another seat however I wanted to sit next to my wife so I decided to suck it up and ignore this. The type of movies,TV programs, games etc available is incredibly limited in comparison to other airlines. <br><br>Meals- Not bad. We got a supper and a breakfast. Better than some other airlines. The trip over to Vietnam was better with a lunch and dinner and the meals were well portioned. Just be careful with hot beverages as cabin crew will serve hot beverages despite being in turbulent conditions meaning its a bit of a juggling act. <br><br>Self serve bar?- I like having a couple of beers during my flight, not over the top, but just enough to enjoy (3-4). I got one beer at each meal, but was never offered anything else. I thought there was a self serve bar so I'm not annoying cabin crew, but apparently not unless you just want water. I asked for a beer but apparently its only for meal times? <br><br>Crew- They were all friendly. The journey to Vietnam was really lacking in staff attention. We got served meals and then they hid behind the curtain playing mobile phone games for the other parts of the journey. On the return trip the crew was far better and were routinely asking me during the night if I wanted a drink or something to eat. <br><br>Flight basics- The safety video doesn't appear to mean much to Vietnam Airlines, as both my international and domestic trips on this airline either cut short the video, missed the stewards parts or the video played with no sound. The pilot on the to HCMC trip left the seatbelt light on from Darwin till the last hour of the trip which really confused passengers as they were unsure whether it was safe to go to the toilet. And if you land at a Vietnamese airport, you may not embark/disembark at a gate. Most of you flights necessitated walking down stairs to a bus and then packed in with economy (40 mins on one occasion) <br><br>Priority check in?- For all four domestic flights, we found that the priority checkin at the gate was not offered, yet available. The economy passengers line up early or push in after boarding starts so best to either wait or get in early."
743,Merqu,4,"My first time traveling to Vietnam, and thought the airline was not modern, but the reality proves my imagination wrong. The airline is no different from any modern airline, and the ground staff is considerate, she checked if I go approval letter for entrance before I got my boarding pass, this was to prevent I had to come back without valid travel document.<br><br>The meals (I tried breakfast and dinner) were delicious, and the fruit was as fresh as Vietnam's. On and on, I think it worth trying this airline."
743,Darren Lim,4,"I traveled with my girlfriend in February this year and it was a pleasant flight. The flight was full of Japanese as I guess it is their time to visit other countries due to the winter season.<br><br>The entire flight was very enjoyable. They provide almost everything that we could ask for; blanket, snacks, drinks, pillow and whatnot. It was very great experience and I do not mind to fly again with Vietnam Airlines with the price I paid."
743,S D,5,"Very excellant service,  well prepared meals, generous drinks &amp; liquor,  very friendly hostesses, smooth flight."
743,Carol J,4,"This was the least expensive business class fare we could find from Sydney to London. There are two stopovers in Vietnam with a 2 hour domestic flight between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. This is not a problem if you are not in a hurry and the business class lounges were peaceful with food, drinks and showers. The planes were very modern, all flights on time, staff attentive and the food very good. The only problem we had is that we were told at Sydney check in that our checked luggage would go all directly to Heathrow but it had to be collected in HCM City and re checked in for the domestic flight to Hanoi. On our return this had to be done at Hanoi but not HCM City so it needed to be done when transferring from an international to a domestic flight. The only other reason I haven't rated a 5 is that the entertainment options were a bit limited with very few new release movies. I wouldn't hesitate to use this airline again and I recommend it to those who would like the comfort of business class without the huge price tag."
744,Alghofaili,5,"one of the best Airlines, this my 3rd time to experience a very good service, friendly crew, tasty food. always on time"
744,Claire M,5,"Fantastic airline, great staff, good food. We're very helpful at checkin, when I asked about seating for my partner who is over six feet tall. We got better seating both ways. I have never found another airline to be as friendly and helpful."
744,trish b,4,A good no frills business class. At the time of the flight I had a severe back problem which meant I was no able to fly unless I could lie flat.<br><br>The seat was perfect inclined flat like Bed. It would have been nice if there were some linen for the bed but it was still ok and much cheaper than most airlines.<br><br>The quality of the food was not very good.<br><br>Business class was very clean and staff both friendly and polite
744,Steve B,5,"Before flying Vietnam airlines was a bit worried how good they would be. Would flights be cancelled and with language difficulties could anything be sorted out. <br>No need to worry. Incredible service, fast check in, English widely spoken, safe and reliable. Luggage and food at no extra cost. What we all expected of all airlines 30 years ago."
744,frasan2014,5,"We booked this return flight from New Zealand. Decided to go business class as it was very little extra ( around US$20 each way ). It was well worth it, priority check in , lounge access, comfortable seats. The aircraft were clean and pretty new A320's. Recommend them."
745,TravelEatXplore,4,"Flew from Saigon to Hanoi for my next destinations. While the plane was an older model, the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room. The staffs was very nice and attentive. While it was a short flight, we were provided with food and drinks. I would definitely fly on this airline again."
745,queen12122015,4,"In general, the service is good, food is fine. Seat is a little bit small. Staffs are friendly. Restroom is not clear and convenient."
745,NopocketsincoffinZ,4,"We were travelling as a couple and had flown from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh earlier in the day and were checked through to Sydney, but they separated us in their system for this long-haul flight.  We ended up on opposite sides of the plane!  The staff at the gate refused to change our seats saying the plane was full.  Once onboard, we moved to be next to each other with the knowledge of the onboard flight staff.  Interestingly, there were about a dozen rows with only one person in it - hardly the 'full' flight like the gate staff had said...  Overall, we had 4 flights with this airline and would recommend them and fly with them again."
745,Msldublin,4,"Was actually very sceptical about traveling with this airline but what a pleasant surprise. Check in was hassle free, flights on time, very comfortable seating, staff so accommodating would definitely fly with them again."
745,Colin D,3,"Highlights: new model planes with higher air pressure and humidity.<br>Lie flat beds.<br>A transit visit of Ho Chi Minh City.  Too late for a city tour, but still had a stay in a 4 star hotel and a swim in the pool.<br>Use of Qantas lounge in Melbourne.<br>Tasty in flight wines.<br>Crew on second leg experienced and helpful <br><br>Non highlights: crew for first leg was not confident.  Meals mixed up....got an item from the second meal for the first meal. <br>Lounge in Ho Chi Minh City has basic food<br>Those that slept through the meal on the second leg (took off after midnight), are not offered snacks until almost breakfast, more than 8 hours after take off.  We were lucky to bring some apples and plums from home.<br>Would like a western option for breakfast."
746,izalt,4,"The flight was so much cheaper than anything else on the market and it was very comparable to Qatar, Jal and Etihad, who also flew recently. Flat bed, decent food etc. The inflight entertainment was a bit limited, which for about $2000 less is not really a hardship, I reckon!"
746,NathaPushpa d,3,"1 bottle of water is not enough for 1hour journey on domestic flight...usually other countries, airlines provides some nibblies with tea or coffee or water"
746,Hoa N,4,"flight take off and landing on time , the seat - entertainment - services - foods is standard have plenty room to improve but I like the baggage allowance 40 kg plus 1 free return domestic add to my ticket ."
746,lorrainemiller46,5,Professional flight crew. Very comfortable plane (787?)  great choice of entertainment with individual TV screen on seat backs. Good food with option of Asian or European and service good.
746,Usdobbin,4,"Going to Vietnam I like the direct flights between Paris/London and Ha Noi/Sai Gon. Connecting flights to Da Nang or Hue are available within less than four hours. Ticket prices are a little above the discounters in Viet Nam, but the service is very reliable. I never experienced big delays, except when a typhoon makes flying impossible. Vietnam Airlines upgraded it's service between Europe and Ha Noi/Sai Gon with a fleet of B787's and Airbus A350's. Meal service is good, you get a choice of Western and Vietnamese food and noodles and sandwiches are available throughout the flight."
747,millyBallaratVic,4,"Decided to travel direct to Vietnam, flew Vietnam Airlines as they fly direct. Aircraft was Dreamliner. Very quiet, very comfortable. Saff were very attentive, service was prompt.<br>We also flew back with Vietnam Airlines and had same service,except for a limited choice of meals, not a problem because was overnight.<br>All in all a very good,enjoyable flight there and back"
747,presby62,4,Very nicely designed and very comfortable.  Service from staff was excellent as was the food and drinks. Would be happy to fly Vietnam Airlines Business Class next trip!
747,150matthew,4,The staff were very good <br>The flight left and arrived on time<br>The seats were comfortable <br>The price was very good
747,Helco,4,"Our first trip on Vietnam airlines and a brand new dreamliner to boot. Very impressed with the attentive service and relatively comfortable seats. Food so so but most airline food is the same standard. Was lovely to fly direct to Hanoi. Only problem was, the incoming flight was delayed which then impacted on out departure, 8 hours late. But this can happen on any airline. Overall we enjoyed the flight and would fly with them again next time to Vietnam."
747,John F,5,"Business Class was fabulous! Comfort plus, gorgeous staff, wonderful food &amp; wine.<br>Couldn't fault the service!"
748,Bob Mo,4,"Looking for a vacation flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi, Vietnam Airlines came through with the right low cost and comfortable travel scheduling.  It's only an hour flight so not much expectation of entertainment or fancy meals, it was just fine.  To fly to Vietnam for a vacation it's nice to go 'with the locals', get an idea of the manner and color of the place you're going, so yes I recommend Vietnam Airlines"
748,Kay,4,"Seats were satisfactory, blankets,headphones provided and adequate room for 90-100 kilo man (max), flight service was very good &amp; just too many movies, etc to choose from menu.  In-flight meals provided was better than expected &amp; appreciated. Thank you. <br>Wife found sleeping difficult but it is economy. Flight home (same airline) found our very early request for window or empty seat was completely ignored and a bit upsetting. Some people had a number of seats vacant.  Poor service by 'check-in staff'. don't know a way around it after you leave the counter. High marks somewhat impacted by lack of consideration. Othewise a pleasant flight home too."
748,Hardik Vekariya,3,"I have booked flight from yangon to Ho chi minh city. The flight was very good, comfortable seating arrangement, Good songs collection. The beautiful and helpful cabin crew."
748,robcinc,4,"The flight was pleasant, the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the plane was comfortable for a economy flight.  Can't fault it."
748,Pamela M,3,"Check-in at Sydney was without any delays or problems.  I had requested from my Agent a window seat and it was given (4A). The Business Class lounge was very comfortable but the food choices very sparse unless you liked Asian food.  But must say the espresso was really good.  On boarding,  the Aircraft interior was very clean, attendants were friendly and helpful and I felt quite comfortable.  Took quite awhile for the ""welcoming champagne and hot towel"" to arrive and in fact, I didn't get to finish my bubbles as it was takeoff time.  Was looking forward to my meal as I had to skip breakfast.  The wait was so disappointing.  Normally I keep the menus but for this flight + return flight there was no reason as all the meals I had were virtually untouched.  Hot food was not and cold food was not.  The airline caters for the Asian palate which I suppose is understandable but I do think they could give more consideration to the Westerners on board.  Short layover at Saigon for flight to Siem Reap which only takes approximately 30 minutes.  This aircraft is very old and looks it.  Only beverage available was water or beer!  My return flight to Sydney was more of the same.  Would I fly with Vietnam again.  Probably not although they do have cheaper Business Class fares than other airlines.  If I did, I would self cater!"
749,PeterGonzalez,5,"Whenever I fly to Vietnam, or other destinations in Asia, I always try Vietnam Airlines first and I never had one single or time item to complain about."
749,anuyusuf,3,Not many options when flying in Vietnam.. We prefer to travel by road and see more when we travel but roads in Vietnam are not too good. Flights are short and cheap so I guess a good option.
749,Hyunjoon K,2,"domestic flights of Vietnam Airline has reputation of low quality services and not-so-well-trained flight attendances. <br>This time one of panel from ceiling fell down during flight and hit one guy next to me.<br>Not saying sorry, excuse or any mentioning that safety, they tried to fix it and failed.<br>During that time no services as most of flight attendances worked on the fixing job."
749,Dennis B,4,"Pleasant staff, but as usual with these smaller planes it feels quite cramped. Getting in and out for toilet calls requires gymnastic gyrations to extricate ones's posterior from the window seat"
749,Nicholas T,5,Traveling between city's had 3 flights with Vietnam Airline all flights left on time and they give you a bottle of water and arrived on time for our flights.
750,Janne002,5,"Although the flight was delayed an hour, this didn't worry us as it was nice to sit and watch the passing parade. It was a short but comfortable flight, the food was good and the service excellent. At first I was hesitant flying with this airline but I didn't need to worry at all. Perfect takeoff and landing! I would definitely recommend and have no hesitation in flying with them again."
750,bradandjackie,4,"We flew premium economy from Sydney to Paris. Sydney to Hanoi was amazing. It was a new aircraft and we were lucky enough to be 2 of 3 people only in this section, . Hanoi to Paris...this was ""premium economy"" too on an older plane, it was not good. Was just like flying economy.<br>Paris back to Sydney we flew Business, this was fantastic all the way. Flat beds, food, cocktails and the staff were all amazing. If you can fly business, do it."
750,Kevin0309c,2,The boarding gate assigned to this flight was suddenly replaced by Viejet and resulted in a mess. Ground staff didn't make any public announcement until it's found that flight was delayed nearly one hour for boarding and another hour sitting in the cabin on apron.
750,David T,4,"When we booked the flight, it was more out of convenience than by choice. My wife and I were quite worried about what to expect as VN is not a common airline option.<br><br>We were pleasantly surprised when we boarded the plane. Service was much better than some of their competitors (e.g. CE), inflight entertainment was relatively OK, food was not too bad.<br><br>I would suggest VN airlines as a viable option for international travelers to VN."
750,Row,1,"Travelled around Vietnam in July/August last year. On the domestic flights the service was ok and the cramped conditions bearable due to the shorter length of flights. It all turned unbearable on the return from HCMC to Melbourne. 9 hours in a cramped, crowded plane was without doubt one of the worst moments of any travel trip I have made (especially is you exclude a bus trip I took in Turkey in 1990, but that's another story). I don't so much blame Vietnam Air, but the cabin service did little to ease the conditions. Also, I can take some of the blame myself, as I broke a major rule when flying economy.............don't travel at night!! I note others seem to fall asleep at the drop of a hat or the dropping of a few sleeping tablets perhaps! So once again silly me for not visiting the pharmacist before the flight."
751,SidneyFace,5,A lot of legroom in cattle class compared to other airlines.  Food is just the usual airline fare.  Staff attentive and friendly.  Landings smooth.
751,ironian,5,"Great flight on the dreamliner.  Was made extra relaxing as there was only two of us in the three seats, so we could stretch out<br><br>Plane was on time and the at the other end the Airlines system for getting you through to a domestic transfer was excellent"
751,tricia c,2,"My husband and I are experienced travelers  for 12 years  around Asia.<br>We traveled his year for the 1st time with Vietnam airlines and we very disappointed.<br>Travel was from Melbourne Australia to Ho Chi Minh Vietnam then on to Danang.<br>All flights were delayed or we were stuck up in the air. The landings were terrible. <br>It is the 1st time we just didn't want to get back on the plane.<br>Other passengers were commenting as well.<br>Food was very average and on the home stretch they ran out of selected food.<br>We has no room to eat properly.<br> Very cramped seating.<br>If you have to fly from Melbourne to Vietnam go Singapore Airlines.<br>It may take you longer and go transit but very comfortable, bit more expensive and good service. Lots more room.<br>Plane flights we have experienced with Singapore airlines have all been good"
751,dal15,4,"Been on flights with this airline on 8 occasions ,quiet  a good airline which tries  to please  all its  passengers. Needs to supply  information to passengers  via electronic  messaging  on updates  and  flight  information as other  airlines  do.If  you  are traveling  th vietnam it's a good  service to use .Very obliging  staff on and  off the ground"
751,Anthony Y,5,"A Saturday 740am int'l flight may sound like an early bird flight, but the new A350, Vietnam Airlines cabin and service from Ho Chi Minh to Pudong, Shanghai is fantastic.<br><br>The flight was once substituted for the a Boeing 787, but both are equally stunning. <br><br>Cabins are both well kept, A350 is reverse herringbone, 787 is all aisle access cubicles with both full flat very private seats.<br><br>The entertainment system is excellent and they provide the noise cancelling headphones as well. <br><br>Upon departure, a very nice welcome drink and warm / cool towel are provided to make the AM boarding a little bit more comfortable. <br><br>Food selection is great, 3 choices in the AM, I've had all three, and the congee is by far the best. But what's really their shining star is the yogurt, and coffee! Maybe it's psychological, because I love vietnamese coffee, but they really do have the best tasting black coffee of any airlines I've flown so far."
752,Sam H,4,"First time user of Vietnam Airlines. Great service, clean plane, nice food and left<br>On time for both flights. Was very impressed"
752,Denny U,4,"Was a little bit worrying about the airline, bit it was a great flight,food not to bad,cabin staff friendly!I would put it on the same as most other carriers!"
752,MarggyCanberra,5,"We recently flew Sydney to Frankfurt (via Ho Chi Minh City), then on the return we went from Frankfurt to Hanoi, Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh and Ho Chi Minh to Sydney - we chose this route as we wanted to spend a few days in each Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh.<br><br>All of the international legs were on the Dreamliner with a 1, 2, 1 configuration so everyone had aisle access. My husband and I had the 2 centre seats on all flights.<br><br>There was six and a half hours between flights in Ho Chi Minh on the way to Frankfurt but we were picked up, provided with a visa, taken to a hotel, given dinner and taken back to the airport. We were told by our travel agent that this would be provided but we were a bit sceptical about how it would work but it was all seamless. Our only complaint was the they tried to give us a Western style meal, we really had to push hard to get Vietnamese.<br><br>The beds were completely lie flat and quite comfortable. The service was very good with the cabin staff keen to serve.<br><br>Some of the food was good and some was pretty ordinary but we never expect great food on a flight.<br><br>The price for our flight was very reasonable and we would not hesitate to fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
752,101holiday lover,4,"Check in was smooth and staff very friendly. <br><br>I think Vietnam Airlines need to be more stricter with carry on luggage as some bags are bigger than the size allowed taking up luggage storage space of others but it seems a blind eye is turned.  <br><br>Food service is eatable.  Wine not so great ( just one glass with lunch).<br><br>Inflight entertainment good,"
752,Karen T,3,"Varied levels of service in flight, both main flights to and from Ho Chi Min city no choice for dinner and when you don't eat fish you can always have bread rolls!!<br>Male staff in-flight on outbound flight were pleasant and polite, female staff on return flight were very abrupt and rushed service we were not impressed.<br>On reaching Ho Chi Min City the connecting flight was cancelled and only the last of 3 flights for the day was available, so an 8 hour delay the only positive was we were allowed access to the VIP Lotus lounge with complimentary food and drink while we waited."
753,cummackj,2,"I would hesitate to recommend or use Vietnam airlines again.  If your flight goes according to plan you are probably going to be OK but if there are delays or anything out of the ordinary then they are not very helpful in trying to fix the problem for you and certainly you can forget about apologies, vouchers or anything similar to help make things right. Most airlines, budget or otherwise, try their best to keep their cutomers satisfied if they cause them delays or missed or cancelled flights but not Vietnam airlines. In my recent trip to South east Asia I found other budget airlines provided a better more reliable service."
753,Stefan B,4,"We had a long flight from London with a connecting flight at Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang, the economy, service on the outbound was very good, overnight with am arrival, the connecting flight was delayed for one hour due to problems at the airport. The return flight was Da Nang via Hanoi, when our scheduled flight inbound was late we were switched to an earlier flight to ensure we could make the connection, the luggage was ticketed through to London. the food on the inbound was not as good as the outbound but they do serve very good 'Pot Noodles' and sandwiches as snacks.  Both long hauls were Boeing 787, connecting flights Airbus 321"
753,Vambrace,5,"This airline is very economical but also offers similar service to other airlines like Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines or Thai Airlines. The staff are always very helpful and choice of menu is also good. Seating is spacious and plane modern. At times they codeshare with Air France."
753,carolynneary6,4,Lounge not up to standard<br>Long stopover hard to cope with<br>Seat configuration uncomfortable service and food a bit haphazard
753,Gurmeet B,1,Avoid this airline if you are on tight schedule as on time accuracy is really bad. Moreover for local routes they will even change your reservation at last moment without telling reason. Delays seems normal for Vietnam Airlines.
754,BrianJan,4,"Compared to our outbound flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh, the return check in experience left a lot to be desired.  For instance, the boarding sign at the gate was put up some five minutes prior to the boarding announcement being made on the PA system and then no boarding by seat rows which resulted in organised chaos on the aircraft.  <br>Still a good flight with good service and meals.<br>On arrival at Melbourne, it turned out that 7 international flights had arrived within a few minutes of each other, so the delays were significant even for Australians returning.  This was further exacerbated by a 500+ meter queue to get through Customs where only ONE lady was on duty.  From arrival at the terminal it was over 2 hours prior to exiting the arrivals area.  Not a good look for Melbourne."
754,BrianJan,2,"This is the outbound leg to Da Nang on June 8th 2017.  The return flight was seven days later was VN 121 to Ho Chi Minh City.<br>Domestically, VN airlines leave a lot to be desired.  No aero bridges, no boarding by seat rows called,  low floor buses with very little or no seating.<br>On arrival at aircraft, no indication from ground staff on which stairway to use.  This results in passengers moving in opposite directions in the very narrow aircraft isle to get to their respective seat.<br>In one instance passengers were herded onto a bus and left for twenty minutes with doors open and no air conditioning while ground staff hurried around to find a driver for the bus.<br>On a 1 hour 20 minute flight, the only offering from cabin attendants was a bottle of NOT CHILLED water.<br>The Airbus did not have any in flight entertainment even though the seat were fitted with facilities to provide such information.  In fact even the seats could not be reclined.  On the return trip it was the same, if not worse. <br>On arrival at our destinations, there was not an announcement on the aircraft as to which doors passengers could leave the aircraft.<br>All in all a very poor performance for both on ground in cabin staff of VN."
754,BrianJan,4,"Departing Melbourne on an International flight is always relatively easy.  The VN Check In staff are most helpful and offer a lot of advice.<br>Unfortunately, VN do not offer early seat reservations unless of course your happen to be one of their frequent flyers.  So the earliest seat reservation/check in on line is less than 24 hours and no later than 2 hours prior to departure.<br>On arrival at Ho Chi Minh, even though our cases were checked through to Da Nang, once we had cleared all formalities, there was no offer to move our cases to the domestic terminal.  Also there are very few signs in the International terminal in English that provide information as to where the Domestic terminal is located.<br>This resulted in 3 more baggage scans then a 500+ meter walk pushing a trolley to the Domestic terminal where very few VN ground staff spoke English.  Managed to find the right way by chatting to a fellow local traveler who spoke good English and was able to provide fantastic information.  Not a good example of VN airlines on ground performance."
754,Bryan H,4,"Actually flew them several times within a six week period during January and February. Once domestically, and two international flights. All were solid experiences and would fly them again if given the opportunity. Attendants were pleasant, food was tasty, and flgiht and arrival times were on time. No complaints."
754,Frouk M,2,flew from Danang to Saigon.. delayed flight by 2 hours. Flew from Saigon to Phu Quoc.. another 2 to 3 hour delay. Last flight back to Hanoi from Phu Quoc...a 3 hour delay. Food on this 2 hour flight was inedible. A dry bread bun with a peice of processed meat that looked grey and old. This airline was recommended by our agent in NZ but I personally will opt for alternative airlines. Flew once with Viajet.. cheaper and on time! No complaints there...
755,Anne L,3,"This first flight was delayed only 25 minutes. I only mention this as we experienced longer delays on our next two flights,with Vietnam Airlines, while visiting Vietnam recently.<br>This flight was comfortable with no frills.<br>The staff were fine.<br>The next flight was from Ho Chi Minh City to Phu Quoc.<br>This flight was delayed 1hr 30m. We were kindly given some Pho..not as good as the usual Pho, but the thought was there.<br>The flight made up the lost  time as we arrived at the time on our booking reference.??? Made us wonder. Our booking stated just over and hour flight time, we did it in just over half an hour.<br>The third flight, from Phu Quoc to Hanoi, was delayed 2 hours.<br>A lack of seating at Phu Quoc made the wait a little difficult for some. We were unable to check bags in until shortly before the flight departed.<br>The lack of commication was noticeable.<br>Once in flight we were served with a dry bun with 2 slices of cucumber and a slice of something which looked like processed sausage, coke or water, and a dish of I think fruit and tapioca.<br>We noticed that many people around us refused to eat the food. I ate the fruit and had a drink. Not the bun or its contents. My travelling partner did not attempt anything other than a drink and a little of the fruit.<br>Once again the flight was comfortable. <br>We paid a premium price (they were not cheap) for our three flights and received ""no frills"" flights, and poor communication from ground staff.<br>Of course we are more than happy to wait, if a plane is delayed for genuine reasons or matters of safety.<br>I normally give positive feedback on this site...but had the need to have a grizzle this time.<br>We also flew from Hanoi to DaNang on Vietjet...we could not fault this airline."
755,Warby,4,Flight was on time and comfortable for the short journey. Upgraded domestic departures area is a great improvement. Breakfast served on board and staff attentive<br><br>Boarding was the only let down as buses both ends
755,fiamma11,4,"Our flight was smooth, comfortable and without complaint. Moreover, the value was excellent. I would fly Vietnam Airlines again without reservation."
755,Warby,4,"Flight arrived early but then took 20 minutes to bus to terminal which is not normally the case<br><br>Check in, lounge and boarding were good. Seat booked had been reallocated so I got an emergency exit seat which may have more leg room but is uncomfortable<br><br>Meal served was really good"
755,pereira407,5,"Its a lot more expensive than other airlines, but was surely worth the price. Staff are friendly and good. Food was good. No complaints except too many noisy kids in the flight, surely the airlines cant do anything about it."
756,bckain,5,"I have flown most popular airlines in the world. I have to say Vietnam Airlines are up there in the top five. We flew the in the new dream liner, what a great aircraft. The staff on my flight were absolutely fantastic, the meals were huge, I had prawns and scallops, could not finish it all, and the causes just kept coming out. A very sincere thanks to Vietnam Airlines for making this flight  a very memorable one. You certainly have my future business. I have no hesitation in recommending Vietnam Airlines, they are a Extremely good airline. Congratulations guys. Brian"
756,rhondda1,3,"The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The seats are a little narrow and small (I am not at all obese or overweight 5.7"" 60kg).  Suffered a broken foot at Da Nang airport (very poor sign posts, in fact none), however my return flight from Da Nang to HoChiMinh City was filled with help and support from all Vietnam airlines staff.  Requiring a wheelchair, the airline was responsive and helped pave the way through officialdom.  They ensured that I had transport to and from the plane.  En route to Da Nang the agent had provided us with a flight that did not match that in the airline computer, however, the staff moved seats around so that we could travel on the earlier flight.  Extremely helpful, friendly and overall fantastic staff."
756,GPM84,4,I have flown two internal flights with Vietnam airways and was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy and very professional. You are allowed to bring water through security. The airport departure areas are clean with the usual shops. The planes flown were both Airbus. The only drink supplied on board was bottled water.<br>The flight was very smooth including the landings and more importantly on time. The crews were very professional and polite.<br>I would diffenetly fly with this airline again.
756,Norpet,4,"This was our return flight back to Australia on Vietnam Airlines. Checkin in Frankfurt was quick as there is dedicated Business Class checkin. Went through to the Sky Team Lounge which was also very pleasant.  Before takeoff the crew come round offering drinks, amenity kits and slippers, which are a nice touch. The signature cocktails offered are well worth a try, very much enjoyed the Saigon Sunset cocktail. The flight departed Frankfurt about 5 minutes early.  And after the seatbelt sign went out, the crew come round to the take your drinks and lunch orders. Food on this flight was again very good. During the night crew came around with drinks, sandwiches, cakes etc. Bottled water was also handed out. Vietnam Airlines also provide noise cancelling headsets, but they are not of the best quality.  One thing we did notice was a lack of announcements from the cockpit, only one announcement was made and that was just before landing in Ho Chi Minh. Also before landing a breakfast was serviced. Again when we landed we were not parked at an airbridge so had to get on the bus to the terminal. We arrived in Ho Chi Minh at 6:30am and our onward flight to Sydney was not until 9pm that night. When we arrived in the terminal there was a board with our names on it, and a tour guide to greet us. We sat while he got our entry visas and then through immigration and onto a minivan for our transfer to the hotel provided by Vietnam Airlines. We were given a written itinerary for our stay including a city tour if we wanted it. Plus lunch and dinner were include in the package in the hotel. We choose not to take the city tour as we have been to Ho Chi Minh before, so just had a sleep, then lunch and later in the afternoon had high tea in the hotel foyer and listened to a young man playing a grand piano, it was very nice. We had lunch in the hotel, but skipped the dinner as we knew we would be having dinner on the flight. We were collected by our tour guide at 6:30pm for our 9pm flight back to Sydney. Again we went into the Lotus Lounge at the airport before boarding our flight home to Australia. The flight home was again very good, food and service could not be faulted. Dinner was served after takeoff and breakfast served before landing in Sydney."
756,Norpet,4,"This was our first time on Vietnam Airlines and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the experience was. Firstly checkin in Sydney was fast and we were given an Express Pass for immigration and then into the Sky Team Lounge. Our flight departed the terminal on time but as usual there was lots of congestion at Sydney Airport so we took off ½ hour late. The seats in Business class are very comfortable and arranged in a one, two one format across the aircraft. After take off we had our lunch and drinks order taken. Drinks arrived and then the tray arrives with the starter, and soup, on the tray. Staff come around and offer a good selection of breads. The starter plate is collected and then your main course selection is delivered. Then the dessert selection is brought around followed by tea and coffee. The meal was very good. Crew are very attentive and always smiling, nothing was too much trouble. The flight entertainment was ok, there were some new release movies, and some TV shows but have seen better selection on other airlines.  Just before landing another meal is serviced, and again it was very nice. On arrival in Ho Chi Minh, we were not parked at an airbridge but had to be taken to the terminal in buses. When we arrived in the terminal, our names were on a board and a tour guide waiting to meet us. The tour guide sat us down while he obtained our Visa’s for us, we then went through immigration and the guide escorted us to a minivan for our transfer to the hotel Vietnam Airlines provided for our 7 hour transit. We were given instructions on food etc available at the hotel and told we would be collected again at 8:30pm for our 11pm flight to Frankfurt. After immigration we headed to the Lotus Lounge where there is limited food and drink but still a pleasant atmosphere. The flight the Frankfurt departed early, we were served a full diner and drinks but were not really hunger as we seemed to be eating all day on the flights. Again on this flight the cabin crew were very good and the food was really good. During the night crew came around we drinks, sandwiches cakes etc. Before landing in Frankfurt a full breakfast was served. Although the Dreamliner seats are very comfortable they are a bit narrow at the foot end of the bed, but did manage to sleep for 6 hours on the flight to Frankfurt. The flight arrived 45 mins early into Frankfurt."
757,Brian W,3,Only had one short - one hour - leg with this carrier but it was in a clean modern plane that arrived on time in Ho Chi Min City.  Two complaints - the only drink offered or served was a 500 ml bottle of water and the numbering for the seat on the overhead lockers (base) seemed to be out of pitch with the actual seats but this was quickly resolved.
757,thd007,4,"its good, nothing special as it was only a domestic flight, so i can't comment much on food and entertainment."
757,Socy72,4,"Flew direct from Sydney to Hanoi return. Great airline, friendly staff &amp; nice new aircraft. Food is good. I would fly Vietnam Airlines again with no hesitation. 👍"
757,Ben C,2,"I experienced a flight to and from Vietnam with Vietnam airlines. I dint find them to be good. Very basic inside the plane, the food wasn't great and dint feel very welcomed.<br><br>I had 3 issues <br><br>I wanted to upgrade. The staff wasn't very helpful and the price to upgrade is 75% cheaper online. I don't understand why it is so much cheaper online.... when asking the staff in the airport and on the plane they dint help.<br><br>You can get endless amount of alcohol. Although there was no duty free or food service to purchase.<br><br>I was hungry during the flight and I got up and asked one of the staff if they had any food I could have. I was just told no!!!<br><br>Then on landing in Heathrow we circled around 5 times obviously we missed our spot. Although the captain dint tell us anything.<br><br>Not great customer service although I suppose it was the cheapest next time I would fly with Cathy persific"
757,Craig D,5,What a lovely way to travel with out breaking the bank.<br>When you get on the plane and go to your seat and the air hostess greets you by name that works.<br>The whole experience was great thank you.
758,Kongzi8,1,"We bought tickets for our flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh. There wasn't many choices and we noted that Vietnam airlines is one of the better ones in Vietnam since it is their national airlines.<br><br>However, we noted that the airlines didn't show the highest standard in terms of their plane cleanliness and hygiene. The plane was full of stinking toilet smell with no ventilation when we boarded he plane. The stinking smell was so unbearable and with no ventilation, it was even worse. The pilot even had to apologize for the no ventilation or aircon while the plane was preparing for take off. The aircon only came when he was about to fly off.<br><br>What kind of standard are we looking at? Terrible!!!<br><br>Service by the staff was instead and as usual great."
758,kwb4455,5,"So impressed with the modernization of Vietnam Airlines in the past two years. As this was my 1st trip to Vietnam I chose premium economy. Wow, 42"" leg room and 2x2 seating means comfort. Good food and efficient service using new equipment (Boeing Dream-liners on both legs, one of which was only 3 days old!). Such a difference to my experience with British Airways to Bangkok last year. Vietnam Airlines surpassed the comfort of BA business class and BA used 17 year old scruffy planes."
758,RugbyMadKiwi,5,"We had another great experience with our flights with Vietnam Airlines. we flew Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang return. Both flights were punctual and the service was great from start to finish ! The lounge in Hoi Chi Minh is really great , its very bright and new and the Business class seats on the plane are very comfortable , have nothing but praise for this excellent airline !"
758,Richard J,5,"What a great airline with wonderful in flight service.  We flew to Da Nang through Ho Chi Ming City and return.  We could not fault this airline being on time for every flight, great service both in the air and on the ground with plenty of staff to assist you when you arrive in Ho Chi Ming in transit for another flight.  Their in flight service could not be faulted with the cabin crew always attentive to your needs.  The meals served were of the highest quality with good options available to suit all tastes."
758,Ross M,5,"I'd booked this flight online a month or so before leaving Australia.<br><br>The flight was on time, arrived on time, and the service was good, what I expect when I travel Business Class."
759,afj1103,5,Unfortunately due to the rains our flight got delayed . We were supposed to fly from Hanoi to Bangkok and then from Bangkok to Mumbai. Vietnam airlines was delayed by about 3 hrs as a result of which it would be impossible to take the connecting flight to Mumbai. Vietnam airlines spoke to a personnel at the Bangkok airport and they put us on another flight Thai airways to Mumbai. They provided us with pure vegetarian jain food on board. Although the flight was delayed due to the rains I am thankful that I could atleast reach Mumbai. The crew was very welcoming and looked after all our needs.
759,martinidoc,4,"We used Vietnam air for a couple of internal flights, and finally to transit back from Saigon to Bangkok for our longhaul with BA back to London. All the sectors were on time. The staff were pleasant, and the check in, boarding and inflight service were all good."
759,movingalong57,4,"Flight from Sydney to Saigon on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was a nice experience, departure delayed but on time arrival. A vey pleasant flight service, we almost miss the gruff take it or leave it Aussie Qantas experience..... <br>The internal flights from Saigon to Nha Trang &amp; back were functional, mostly to time &amp; again nice service staff. The return night flight to Sydney was also good but reminded me that day flights are much better &amp; many thanks to the inventor of noise cancelling headphones.<br>Next trip we are going to leave the travel bags at home and pack our stuff in boxes for a more genuine experience !"
759,balinutsnewcastle,5,"Have now flown 8 times with this airline and can't fault them, very proffesional . comfortable, not bad leg room, food is great [ but i like all airline food]  planes are being renewed ,i think we flew on a brand newy will definately fly with them again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
759,Bob W,2,"We were booked to fly out at 3.00pm for a short flight to Nha Trang.<br><br>We were dropped off at the Airport at 1.20pm and were able to check in and get through security ok.<br><br>A massive rain storm came down about 2.15pm and after a while we were informed our flight would be delayed until the rain subsides.<br><br>About 3.30 our flight dropped off the departure TV screens. We asked staff and were told our flight was departing from another gate. Our flight still did not come up on any TV monitors and we were continually being redirected to other gates, then we were told we haf missed our flight.<br><br>Frustated we spoke to an Assistant  who had a white uniform on took us downstairs to a supervisor who appeared stressed and assured us that our flight had not departed. She told us to go back to gate 10. When we got back none of the Vietnam Airlines staff who did not have a great knowledge of the English language.<br><br>Our flight eventually came up on the Departure screen which was to depart at 6.15pm.<br><br>We got to Cam Rhan Bay Airport at 7.45pm which was three and a half hours after we were scheduled to arrive.<br><br>I believe it would be helpful if there was a good English speaking Supervisor on the Departure Lounges who would be able to assist.<br><br>My Flight No was 7358."
760,Losdados,4,"We were bit worried to use planes in vietnam, but Vietnam airlines is the same as standard European airlines like lufthansa, austrian etc. Good service, reliable, no delays. NO worries while flying with them."
760,phuketjc9,3,"Nice aircraft, clean and new. Lovely service. But every time we travel with Vietnam Airlines they have significant delays or completely change the flight. Every time.....It's so annoying.  As such, I have decided not to fly VA anymore."
760,Donna H,5,"I flew with Vietnam airlines and I was very impressed with it! The seats were comfy, lots of leg room, good service and a nice plane! I felt happy when I got off the flight and I will definitely fly with them again. In fact I'm looking at a flight now. I would recommend anyone to book with them without hesitation. 😁"
760,nkwins,4,"Easy trip to Hoi An from Ho Chi Minh thanks to Vietnam Airlines.  Getting on board, flying and getting out of the airport was so easy!<br>I loved this trip on Vietnam Airlines!"
760,Glen T,5,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines a few times domestically and also from Hanoi to Luang Prabang. We found the srrvice to be exdellent, the flights were on time and the check in process was efficent and there was ample leg room in economy. The flights were good value bearing in mind you did not have to pay add on fees for baggage etc.  We'd  happily fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
761,Michael,4,"Had to first change a booked ticket, then cancel it and subsequently rebook a different route and was very impressed by Vietnam Airlines customer service. Virtually immediate response via mail.<br><br>I had booked the flight on the excellent Airbus 350-900 but disapontingly it was substituted by a 321. The product was still fairly good. Friendly crew, comfortable seat and a good meal."
761,bream111,5,"Very friendly staff, plenty of leg room in cattle class. Meals were adequate. In house entertainment. All in all an enjoyable experience."
761,rjhatch81,4,"We flew from London to Sydney in January and had a great time on board.  The reason we chose Vietnam airlines is because the price as unbelievable.  Great value.  On board the 787 all business class passengers have direct aisle access and the seats convert into a fully flat bed.  Service was good and the food was very tasty.<br><br>Vietnam airlines could improve the inflight entertainment as the selection was not great, and some films just didn't work at all.<br><br>We stopped in Ho Chi Minh on the way to Sydney (and also on return leg) and this stopover is very long - 16 hours!  However Vietnam airlines give passengers a hotel room, breakfast, lunch and dinner vouchers and a city tour which was great to kill some time and help adjust to the huge time difference.<br><br>I would certainly recommend Vietnam Airlines for anyone looking for a good value business class seat"
761,dumpling4,1,Flight delayed for 2 hours. Luckily I do not have any connecting flight at the destination or it will ruin my travel plan. Leg room super cramp. No in flight entertainment. Very small toilet. Their in-flight service is very poor. They ignore the call button throughout the whole 10hrs flight. But their food is nice and tasty. Recommend for backpackers or budget travelers.
761,Jonathan R,5,It was pretty amazing for the flight. The flight has a small delay due to late check in from a passenger but the flight attendant and the captain have a good communication with others passengers.<br>I got promoted in the bussiness class because the flight was overloaded.<br>The pho in the flight was also amazing - of course cant be compared with the real one in Hanoi but still amazing
762,Thecatsmum4,4,"The above class of service does not give you the option for premium economy, well we flew in that class.  The seats were huge with so much legroom you could not touch the seat in front - excellent and the upgrade price was minimal.<br><br>The staff were fine but the food and drink does require some refinement, their idea of an inflight snack between meals is a pot noodle!  <br><br>However we were on the flight to get from A to B and for that alone they get full marks, comfort and promptness were excellent.  Would definitely fly again if going that way."
762,Kelly O,5,"We flew from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang with Vietnam airlines, to save time and money whilst in Vietnam. This took us an hour a twenty minutes compared to what we think might have been about 7 hours on a train, and cost around £65 per person. <br><br>The flight itself was smooth, organised, the crew were very friendly and there were no issues with language barrier, we were all able to understand each other using broken Vietnamese/English. The flight provided snacks and refreshments (this is unheard of on U.K short haul!) and the whole experience was very enjoyable. We even had indivual screens despite this being a smaller plane. I would definitely recommend flying with Vietnamese airlines and we will definitely use them again in the future."
762,asdunn1,5,"The staff were excellent, once on the plane we were looked after for our long trip to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.<br>The food was excellent and the variety of drinks offered.<br>No cost for food or drink compared to other  airlines.<br>Could not get rid of the subtiltles on the TV screen, still watched a movie.<br> The dream liner plane was very quite and smooth in tuburlance. <br>The down side was once we got of the plane we caught the shuttle bus to the terminal, once in it was very hard to figure out where you had to go to pick up your luggage, asked numerous people and the english was very poor and could not understand.<br>We had a interconnecting flight and we were concerned we would miss this flight,<br>it took a fair while to go thru customs.   There should be a line for passengers in transit. The Vietnam airline staff just pointed to a direction to walk in which was not reassuring to me, the airport is so big and lack of clear direction whith signs.<br> It would be a better idea if passgeners in transit were escorted by Vietnam airlines to the connecting flight.  <br>Andrew"
762,ASIAC64,5,First time flying with This airline. Booked through Cathy Pacific. Due to flight delay outward bound flew Jetstar . What a difference!!<br>Vietnam airlines so much better. More leg room . Better seats . Curious staff. Food was very good. Very impressed .
762,Cheryl55555555,5,We were a little nervous about our ability to communicate and navigate our way to the airline and checking in etc.  I even had my translator program text ready in Vietnamese . There was no need to worry. All signs were in English and Vietnamese The door guard knew enough English to ask us for our airline and directed us to the correct check in counter. There was no need to use the translator.<br><br>Check in staff also spoke some English and processed our e-tickets in a timely manner. All directions and advice given in English and easily understood.  <br><br>Security scanning process achieved and we found our gate.  The flight left on time. We also did a return flight with them.  Very good service.
763,chaxaxa,4,"good service, friendly staff, usually on time.  but poor option for food. in conclusion I 'd like to say that I like it - Vietnam airline for my journey."
763,SororityLife,4,"its just a 1.5hrs flight to HCM.  flight attendants are friendly. no bumpy air rides. food is just fine, still acceptable for in-flight meals."
763,Thu V,5,On time and check in fast.<br><br>The flight attendants were professional and friendly.<br><br>Meals and drinks were fine.<br><br>4 stars service
763,Vic Adamthwaite,5,"I've flown Vietnam Airlines 4 times now and have found them to be as good as the best and better than most. The last 2 flights have been on their new B787 Dreamliners. Bigger windows, comfy seats (even for me at 186 cms). The flight attendants were very good as was the food. The entertainment system is easy to navigate your way through and there is a USB charger at each seat.<br>We were right beside the engines and could hardly hear them even at take off."
763,enjayaitch,4,"This flight was only short and trouble free. Staff were very attentive and because this was a short flight, there was no onboard entertainment or meal. Staff did, however, offer a bottle of water."
764,blink99,3,"Flights were expensive for a 1 hour flight to HCMC, service onboard was great but 1 bottle of mineral water handed out to passengers during the flight, that was the drinks service.  Very penny pinching, would not fly again, would fly a budget carrier inland Vietnam probably the same service."
764,Larice L,4,"After booking the flight months in advance, we finally departed for a much anticipated holiday. Vietnam airways did not disappoint. Their ground support in Australia was really helpful, the flight was more than comfortable and value of money exceptional. We had a terminal transfer in ho chi min to Hanoi that was taken care of by their ground staff, seamlessly. The Dreamliner - state of class, service onboard excellent and co- share with Qantas so the lounges were pretty good too. All in all - great alternative and really reasonable business class travel."
764,HappySnappyGirls,3,Vietnam airlines was good. On time. Slightly below average meals for business class. But value was excellent - seats booked online on Vietnam airs website were remarkably cheap - $125US. Well worth the extra space and extra baggage allowance as they are strict with weights.
764,kapsbell,4,"We have just returned from Vietnam and did 2 internal flights with them. Both were excellent. Quick check in service (unlike Aussie airlines). Efficient and courteous staff, clean aircraft, good seat pitch (leg room and I am 6ft) and they took off on time."
764,Garry A,4,Vietnam Airlines has started flying Boeing 787 Dream Liners between Sydney and Saigon... very nice aircraft and the airline does give the traveler a non stop flight between Australia and Vietnam..  the new aircraft are nice to travel in and worth trying..
765,Shanice,1,DOn't travel with the air company Vietjet it's the worse airline that I had flight in my entire life. If you are in need they won't help you. They are rude in the check in area and feels like they hate tourists. So bad experience. They make my day so horrible. Felling deception of human beings.
765,Alice V,5,No problems at all and more importantly no delays. We took 3 Vietnam airline flights and all landed in time.
765,NeilC2607,4,"The flight departed from Sydney gate 10 mins early for a long taxi and took flight on time.<br>All staff in Business class were Friendly and attentive<br>Business class food had a good selection to choose from, not just oriental cuisine.<br><br>On the new Boeing 787, the In flight entertainment was on a large touch screen TV and has a selection of 10 movies, both new and old releases, in english with Vietnamese subtitles option, music, TV shows, kids cartoons/ shows, 34 international videos (old and newish releases), lots of games and more.<br>Certainly enough entertainment for a flight from Sydney to Hanoi.<br><br>Flat beds were comfortable enough to sleep, although a little cramped in the area.<br>Toilets were always clean"
765,K P,2,"Expensive for less than 1 hour of flight. The flight was delayed for 4 hours. When asked what was the reason for the delay, the answer from the check-in clerk was: ""Did you receive an email?"". The email was received about a week before the flight. Obviously, the delay was a well planned event. At least, it was staffed with the cabin crew from Lithuania. They were not rude like the usual Vietnamese crews of VN airline."
765,pw848,5,"The new Dreamliners are fantastic, makes a long trip comfortable!!! Food was good and service was exceptional!!"
766,marcopolo111,4,"I was positively surprised on how good this airline is. I used for three domestic flights and I was generally impressed. The positives are many: excellent web site, informative, well organized and easy to use; unbeatable prices, 40 to 60 US $ for segments of 1.5 and 2.5 hours; excellent equipment especially on the Hanoi Saigon travel where many plains are brand new Boeing 787 dreamliners. The few negatives are easy to live with: the service at the desks, gates and on board could stand for improvement. The refreshment choices and quality on coach are even worse than those of US carriers."
766,Rodneyphall,5,"We flew premium economy from UK on their Dreamliner aircraft (in pre-booked seats) to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) in March 2017. Really worth the relatively small price to upgrade - bigger seats, fewer seats in row, more legroom, good food and good staff. Three internal flights with economy seats, 2 hours from Ho Chi Minh to Hanoi with light meal and some drinks included, two one hour flights (Hanoi to Hue and back) with bottled water supplied. All flights on time, aircraft clean and one bonus on the return to UK. When we checked in at Hanoi Airport we were told that the flight was very full and they had sold our premium economy, pre-booked seats!! My blood pressure was starting to rise when the lady smiled and said don't worry we have upgraded you to business class, which we gratefully accepted as a replacement. Again the service, comfort and whole experience all added to bring a great holiday in Vietnam to a fantastic conclusion. No hesitation in recommending Vietnam Airlines to any/all prospective passengers, well done!"
766,moonlotus18,4,We flew on this airlines for the first time and didn't know what to expect. We were nicely surprised. Service from staff - ground staff at the check in and onboard the flight - was very good. They were attentive to the fact we had an elderly person in our group and offered wheelchair assistance service as well as priority boarding which was very thoughtful. Other airlines are not always as attentive. We requested for a child meal for my son and was pleased to receive it - quite substantial for kids. Food is fine and our flight was comfortable. No complaints overall. We arrived on time and got our luggage fine. We will fly with them again.
766,crbarton,5,Good pre booking communications after credit card being hard to input but got there after a couple of weeks. Lounges not too wonderful with basic food but spacious and comfy. Flights all punctual with a little unappetising food. Crew stopped non Business Class sharing our bus to terminal!!!! Luggage sorted quickly.
766,Karl S,4,"Sydney to Frankfurt via Saigon all in new B787 Dreamliner premium economy.<br><br>The day flight from Sydney to Saigon was brilliant. Adequate space, comparable to Australian domestic business class. Economy food and drinks. All good and friendly and you are first to get served sitting in Premium. Even great French sparkling on offer.<br><br>I was very pleased with free visa on arrival, transfers and 4* hotel all provided by VN. Seamless experience and just enough time for a refreshing shower and to do some great local market shopping.<br><br>Overnight flight to FRA was a bit uncomfortable. I was regretting that I did not spend the extra money for lie flat business.<br>I had a bulk row seat. The advantage is that nobody can recline on you. However no foot rest in bulk head, which means that I was sliding down my seat all night and kept waking up because of that. Also close proximity to toilet and it's flushing noise can be bothersome if you don't have ear plugs in.<br><br>Overall very good value for money. In fact, best I know from Australia to Europe.<br><br>Also great that VN let's you mix and match classes when you book on their website.<br><br>I am looking forward to lie flat business on the way back! Once you have been at the pointy end there is no way back.<br>However if you are used to sitting at the back of the plane you will absolutely love VN Premo!"
767,Eugene R,5,Very nice surprise. Was flying from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City for about 2 hours. Was expecting old Russian plane and they have new Dreamliner instead. They even served drinks and sandwiches.
767,Bee032,3,Flew out in April on the Dreamliner which we have flown on three times before. This was by far the worst service. As soon as we took off they rushed to serve us our meal &amp; drinks. For a twelve hour flight we hardly saw any flight attendents.We were starving. Our friends paid for premium &amp; didn't get a better service than us!!! I had to ask for a snack which was a pot noodle!!! Definitely won't be flying Vietnam Airlines again.
767,Saibhuvi,3,"Expensive flight and airline in the whole area and sector for the given flight duration, the service was good but no food for that expensive ticket, no value for money."
767,Wanda,3,Took 5 flights in Feb. 2017. Nothing special about this airline in comparison to Bangkok Airways where I took more in Jan. '17<br>A real drag not to be able to book seats online. Other than that quite forgettable. No lounges.  Average service. Many flights in small airports using same carousels and not able to quickly get bags.
767,tedindy,5,"What a lovely flight we had. The staff were lovely, nothing was too much trouble. We were welcomed on board with refreshing wipes. Then we were serve a drink. Within the hour, we were feed lunch on the way over, dinner on the way back. The food was delicious and there was two choices for each meal. Later in the flight we were offered an snack, although it was more like a mini meal.<br><br>The aircraft was a Dreamliner and was a very comfortable and modern aircraft, with a 3,4,3 seat configuration. The seat allocation had us a bit baffled, I was in h seat and my husband in k but we were side by side. The same occured on a domestic flight when there was no f....E and G were next to each other.<br><br>We also flew from Ho Chi Minh to Dong Hoi on an A320. Very basic with no food or drink available for either purchase or free. However, the staff again were delightful and the plane was clean.<br><br>Just as a footnote, when flying domestically with Vietnam Airlines, the airport taxes are not part of the ticketed price so when you research the ticket, it is more expensive at the final purchase. However, we also flew Jetstar domestically and their ticket prices included the taxes.....Just something to be aware of. <br><br>This is a great airline.... Internationally at least. You won't be disappointed :)"
768,Jeff W,1,"Because at least I'll get a seat.<br><br>We showed up at the airport check in counter with the VA airline personnel telling us we bought our return flight for the day before, and she immediately insisted it was our mistake. We said we booked 3 nights for the hotel in Hoi An, so there was NO chance we would've chosen a return date when we still had a night's stay in the hotel.<br><br>She referred us to ticketing, who didn't bother trying to escalate and insisted it was our fault. Finally ticketing referred us to ""customer service"", who greeted us with a frown. No surprise within seconds she was explaining how there was no way their system was wrong and that we made a mistake. After trying to talk to her for 10-15 minutes she gave up trying to help us and stopped responding to us altogether, read ignored us. She literally stared at her computer screen as we asked if we can speak with a manager. Initially she said she IS the manager and there's no one else we can talk to. Then after pushing she provided the name and email of her manager, which she then later said the email is for customer service centre. Complete inconsistency. After about 20 min, she decided we were insignificant and not worth helping, and went back to stare at her computer screen, ignoring any and all of our questions.<br><br>Another customer was beside us and getting similar treatment from another representative. He told them he had paid for his ticket and they kept telling him it hasn't been issued. How in the world is that his problem, that the ticket wasn't issued, the man complains, to no avail, and was forced to buy a new ticket.<br><br>Stay away from this airline at all cost. They think this is an easy way to make extra ticket revenue. It'll catch on."
768,Quang Kiet Le,3,"I am a Platinum LotuSmile of Vietnam Airlines and usually travel on the route between Ho Chi Minh city and Ha Noi. Aircraft was new and modern, flight was often on time. Flight attendants were getting better but the in-flight meal was as awful as 10 years ago while in-flight entertainment was totally depended on the pilot - if he was happy, he would turn it on, otherwise the passengers were forced to watch what the pilot would like to. Vietnam Airlines has claimed it provided 4-star experience on its flight but so shame, I did not see any 4-star quality service!"
768,LeisaChell,5,"We flew on the Dreamliner and found the plane to be very modern.  Each seat has its own high quality entertainment system.  I suggest taking your own headphones as these are handed out about half an hour after take off and collected half an hour before landing.  So if you don't want to miss the last of your movie- take your own and keep watching!  The food was very good, except for the fish dish, but you are very well fed and watered.  The staff were very pleasant and helpful.  I would certainly fly with them again."
768,Gypsykylie,5,We were pleasantly surprised with how lovely and efficient this airline was.  I was completely informed every time there was the slightest change to the flight time for weeks prior and some local airlines could take some note of how good this airline ran things.
768,itsmeyannickbonn,4,"The flight was ok though there are some areas that can be improve. First, cabin crews should be firm when explaining to the passengers. They cannot just say yes to whatever the passenger want. I was forced to changed my seat because apparently two of the passengers want to be seated together. What's the purpose of doing a web check in if in the end they will not honor it. Second they talk too fast and we can't hardly understand them. The accent must be the reason. In that case they should speak slowly. Aside from that everything's ok though the flight arrived two minutes late."
769,Llewellyn53,5,We have flown Vietnam Airlines before but this time we upgraded to Business class for $US55 for both of us! With our own check in bag drop was available hours before the flight and we were allowed in to the Lotus lounge which was a pleasant experience. We chose not to use the Business Class only bus to be taken to the plane opting for the usual economy bus. The Business Class section of this domestic flight had so much room it was hard for me to push my backpack under the seat in front of me. Service was impeccable and delivered with a smile - fantastic experience. Try it for yourselves.
769,Barbara L,3,"Our flight time and number changed several times prior to departure, despite very regular flights going to Danang. We flew just on the eve of the public holidays so the flight was full to the brim. Refreshment towels and drink in flight, but no rubbish collected. Quick flight. Got us from one place to the next. A means to an end for a short trip."
769,Anne M,5,"We flew premium economy on Vietnam Airlines in April 2017 and were absolutely amazed by the service, the comfort and the food - they have the newest fleet in all of Asia, and are very proud of that.  The 787 Dreamliners are absolutely fantastic, with plenty of leg room.  On our way home we upgraded ourselves to Business and had a pod....OMG it was fabulous!  Will definitely be flying Vietnam Airlines again!"
769,Barbara L,5,"Our flight departure time changed several times in the lead up but once on board we were very happy to see that the flight was only about 2/3 full. Plenty of leg room between seats. Full cabin service offered including blanket and pillow. The food was very good - we were both pleasantly surprised. Reasonable range of movies. The cabin crews level of service was adequate. We flew direct, departing about 10.30am and arrived feeling refreshed and in good time for dinner."
769,Ben A,1,"We are on flight VN610 heading to Hanoi and we encounter the worst staff in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport. She's not polite, did not smile and so arrogant she should not be in costumer service. We had terrible experience! Sorry but you have poor costumer service."
770,385andersp,3,"Travelled DAD-SGN on 16th April 2017 on A321 aircraft. Tried in vain to change to a later flight with vacant seat but was not allowed without paying penalty, despite my fare rules says “change without fees”. They offered me standby for free but that was a joke as I then would have to risk everything as I’d forsaked my earlier flight. Lounge in Danang used to be good but is now run down, dirty, no alcoholic drinks, staff washing dishes in front of service table. Lounge staff informed me that due to unwillingness from VN to increase their lounge-payments the operator has been forced to save. <br>VN are now cutting costs seriously in their domestic business class. I was informed by lounge staff that that passengers consume 2+ cans of beer on average (this is in Vietnam 80 cents minus taxes!). VN refuse to pay that. The soft-drinks, which costs double as beers, are however available. But fruit juices have also gone. The flight was delayed ½ hour. Onboard the business seats are becoming very old. Instead of 4 rows in business there are now only 2 rows, and on a full plane it feels very cramped. Better travel economy seats, there is more space in general than with this squeezed configuration of 2 x 2 in 2 rows. They have shortened the distance to put in more seats on their A321! Shame on VN, for deteriorating their domestic business class; it used to be a very good option. Food is poor and menu has run for years (an attempt to serve “canapés” which are disgusting, tasteless, greasy, cold, and ugly. The drink service is OK (soft, beer, hot-drinks). Newspapers offered. Not more than a 3 star rated airline in terms of service."
770,Mimi L,3,"Flew the Boeing Dreamliner to Saigon. Beautiful aircraft.  Crew professional.  Flight was full on Good Friday with many families traveling during school holidays. seated in Economy the food was to a standard one would expect. Event though it was a day flight, pillows &amp; blankest where provided. On arrival into HCMC the aircraft was not parked at an airbridge and after long flight we disembarked on tarmac &amp; where bused to terminal.  Priority aircraft parking should be given to long haul international flights. SYD - HCMC is 8+ hours. As we had connecting flights we found the airport terminal fairly chaotic.  It is currently the only airline with direct service to Vietnam from Sydney."
770,WAM,5,"We recently traveled from Melbourne Australia to Paris by Vietnam Airlines in Business Class, our first time ever up the pointy end. We traveled Business Class because Viet Air have amazing deals which include a nights stopover in Saigon on the way over, free Vietnam visa, transfers to and from the hotel, dinner, breakfast and lounge access plus meet and greet at the airport at the end of the flight and the next day. On the return leg it also includes visa and a day hotel plus free transfers and a day tour of Saigon. Priority into and through immigration and security is also included. We paid just over $4,000 Australian per person return for this. Viet Air have only late last year taken delivery of Boeing Dreamliner planes so Business Class has shell seat  which is quite private, full lie flat bed without affecting passengers behind or in front of you and lots of storage space plus a 15""entertainment screen with very easy to use menus. <br><br>I have set out the full process for us flying from Melbourne to Saigon then onto Paris, spending a night in a hotel at Paris Airport<br>then getting on a TGV the next day. Our hotel was IBIS Styles but there is a ""normal"" IBIS and Pullman Hotel also, all next door to each other and walking distance from Terminal 3.<br><br>When we checked in at the Viet Air counter in Melbourne, there was a priority line for business class passengers. The economy line was almost 100 metres long, the priority line had two people in front of us. It is clearly marked either Sky Team or Sky Priority, I think the latter. When you get checked in they will give you passes into the QANTAS Lounge (part of the business class deal). They also gave us a card, the same size and shape as a boarding pass, which was titled something like Priority Pass which it says gives you priority access through immigration and security. I didn't read it until we got to the QANTAS Club so I don't know how it would work because as soon as we got into the immigration hall a staffer saw my wife's walking stick and took us to the front of the queue, same as at security. I didn't see anyone just hanging around looking for priority card holders but if you do get you such a card I would just ask how to utilise it once inside the immigration hall and also at security.<br><br>The Dreamliner planes are a real dream. There is plenty of space around the seat, lots of storage space for things and the entertainment system is great (a 15""screen I think it has). Viet Air staff were also very good and the food options excellent (not to mention the drink options). The seats really do lie out fully flat and even just sitting up you can stretch your legs fully with a foot rest just like a recliner lounge chair at home. The seats are fully enclosed in a hard shell capsule so the seats in front of you do not come into your space when they recline, nor does yours affect those behind you, even when fully flat.<br><br>In Saigon it was first class service all the way. As soon as we walked into the immigration hall, first stop off the plane but a little walk away, a guy was standing there with our name on a sign. He took our passports, electronic tickets and a passport sized photo which we knew in advance was required for the visa and went off to get our visa. He came back with a young lady who asked us if we wanted our bags now or have them checked through to Paris (I think we were asked the same thing at Melbourne). Anyway she came back with baggage check stubs for our bags checked through to Paris. The guy came back with our visa and took us to a priority immigration line which we were through within a minute or two. He also gave us passes to the Lotus Lounge (Viet Air's equivalent of the QANTAS Club) for the next morning. He then took us to a private car outside the terminal, told us we would be picked up from the hotel at 6am the next morning and we were taken straight to our hotel.<br><br>At the hotel (Vissai Saigon) they were expecting us and check in was easy. They had a note on our papers that said we would be picked up at 6am and to ask us if we wanted a breakfast box (brekky service only starts at 6am there). We said yes but really should have said no because we were going into the lounge. They also told us we could have dinner in their dining room. I went just to see what it was like. We had been fed not long before we landed so I wasn't really hungry so I only picked at what was offered. It was an Asian meal (not surprisingly) and not overly appetising anyway.<br><br>Next morning we checked out just before 6am. We were given our brekky pack in a plastic bag. I didn't look closely but it had an apple, a croissant, a bottle of water and something else each. Our car turned up promptly and the driver came into the foyer to collect us. He dropped us off at the airport entrance and we gave him our brekky packs. A man was there to meet us and at first he just pointed us to the immigration counters which had long lines. We asked for priority due to my wife's disability and he took her to another area, spoke to staff and they put us straight through. I think I saw a Sky Priority counter anyway that was almost empty and we could have used it. We then searched out the Lotus Lounge, not an easy task - a tip - look for a sign pointing to Lounges, go up escalators and at the top of the escalators is Burger King. Facing the Burger King counter, do a 180 degree turn and Lotus Lounge is down that corridor.  I ended up asking twice at different shops, including Burger King, before finally finding it so just persevere. It is quite a good lounge with lots of food options but all Asian (rices and assorted dishes) or European (meat and cheeses) but we had a good meal and an equally good and comfortable wait. Getting on board was a simple and quick process with a Sky Priority line.<br><br>From Saigon to Paris we had a code share Air France flight on an older Boeing 777. You notice an immediate difference on the Air France plane. It is obviously older than the Dreamliner and not as functional. It still has lie flat beds but not the capsule style seats although there is still no issue for other passengers  when you lay your seat out. The functionality of the seat controls is more complex than the Dreamliner and the entertainment system is older, smaller and much more clunky to use (you need to scroll through 26 pages to see just current and recent movies, not as simple a task as it sounds). We were quite frustrated by it by the end of the trip, thank goodness we have Dreamliners on both legs home as we are departing from Heathrow and therefor not code sharing. The service from Air France staff was ordinary at best. They were friendly enough but we only saw them at meal times or when we buzzed for them. Not once did anyone come for just a chat or ask if we wanted a cuppa or anything. That was more galling due to the fact they fed us two hours out of Saigon and not another thing until about two hours out of Paris so that was about nine hours without so much as a snack unless we asked for it. You are entitled to expect more in Business Class. At the end of that flight I felt the only difference between Business and Premium Economy was the extra leg room.<br><br>At Paris Airport, getting our luggage and to the hotel was a challenge to say the least. No-one met us there but nor were we expecting them to. Our plane must have landed at the furthest gate possible from our baggage pickup. Straight off the plane you need to walk at least one kilometre to get to your baggage pickup area. The biggest surprise was you then had to get onto a train (more like a tram) to get to the actual baggage carousel and there is no sign to alert you to this. Of course you follow the signs to the Baggage Pick-up then finally go down a set of escalators only to find a tram station and no sign at all saying get on the tram to get your baggage. There is a counter of some sorts there and it seems everyone goes there to be told to get on the tram. Why they don't just have a sign goodness knows. It is a simple process after that and trams come every few minutes but once you have your baggage the fun starts again. We had booked into IBIS Styles CDG Hotel. IBIS Styles Hotel sent us an email a day or so before departure telling us how to get to them but if you have never done it before, it is lacking in detail. Like so many similar things it seems to assume some knowledge (e.g. I think it says take public transport to Terminal 3 but doesn't say how or where to do so). In any case it requires ANOTHER long walk. Look for signs that point to CDGVAL with a little train/tram symbol under it, they are all over the place. Keep following them and you can't go wrong but at one stage we lost them and had to ask for directions. Once you find the CDGVAL tram/train stop it will take you to Terminal 3 (there is a stop at a car park before then though so don't get off there). More fun once you arrive at Terminal 3. <br><br>At Terminal 3 there are some (very) small signs in orange pointing to the hotels but they are not that helpful. Just go up the escalator, turn left and go to the exit doors very close by. It looks like they lead to a building site but go out them anyway. Look up and around and you will see three high rise buildings close by. IBIS Styles has its name in large lime green lettering on the outside of one of the buildings on about level four or five. It is only about 100 metres away from the exit but all paths are bumpy. Another IBIS is next door to Styles but it has a red sign and the Pullman Hotel is also next door. IBIS Styles is a very nice hotel, basic but clean and fairly new. It has an onsite cafe where you can buy take away snacks and there is a tea/coffee making section just to the left of reception where you can make your own drinks free of charge to take back to your room. Breakfast is a typical French petit dejeuner - croissants, baguettes, jam, yogurt, juice etc. Plentiful and delicious and better still usually included in the room rate.<br><br>After checking out of the hotel, to get to the TGV station or to catch a train into central Paris, re-trace your steps to the Terminal 3 tram. You need to go back to Terminal 2 on the tram to get the TGV or Paris train. Luckily this time the railway station is right next to where the tram stops at Terminal 2. Just go up the escalator after getting off the tram and look for a huge black train timetable board hanging from the roof. It has departures for all over Europe on it and you can't miss it. Go down the escalator near this board and you will be in the main departure hall for not just the TGV's but trains into Paris as well so it is slightly chaotic with wall to wall people. TGV departures are not on the big black board but are on much smaller TV boards with text in blue in the departure hall. Trains for Paris only come up on other screens in this area so don't confuse the two. TGV Departures come up on this blue board about 45 minutes before departure but the platform it will leave from does not come up until 20 minutes before departure. It will have a platform number and either the letter    S or N beside the number. If you look at the big columns at each end of the departure hall, you will see a huge blue S or N. S is at one end of the hall, N at the other so if yours is a number with an S in it go to the platforms at that end of the hall and you will find the departure platform, N is at the other end. Paris trains depart from the bottom right corner as you come down the escalator.<br><br>Be sure to validate your ticket in the little yellow validation machines just before you go onto the platform.  Failure to validate tickets for either leg will lead to a hefty fine, all tickets are checked on board the trains by a roving conductor.<br><br>For TGVs, once on the platform, look out for long narrow rectangular electronic electronic board at about shoulder height that has a graphic of the train on it. It shows where each carriage will stop on the platform so you can position yourself near where your carriage will stop. There are a few of these on each platform and each has a red electronic dot on them near a particular carriage number to show where you are standing now, making it easy to work out where your carriage will stop. Each carriage has a small electronic screen on the outside of the carriage near the door that has the carriage number on it. Do not be fooled by a big painted number 1 or 2 on carriages, this signifies first or second class, not the carriage number. These little screens are small and hard to read unless you are concentrating, the carriages move slowly so there should be no problems.<br><br>If you need to change stations to get to your destination, at the station where you need to change trains, it is a fairly simple process of getting off the train and looking for the platform of your connecting train. Most of these stations are quite small and don't need much effort to change platforms. Again the actual platform number may not come up on the departures board until 20 minutes before departure. <br><br>We have not yet done the return leg to Australia so don't know how that will go. We are stopping over in Saigon for three nights so will not get the benefit of the Viet Air offer. We have already acquired our visa from the Embassy in Canberra but I presume there will be Sky Priority lines we can use and we will be given lounge access passes. Hope this is helpful to some."
770,cheshirecate,3,"Booked premium economy but did not get premium service. Flight was delayed by two hours and when we finally boarded was shocked by the attitude of some of the staff. No check regarding stowing luggage or seat belts. No before dinner drinks and snacks . Food hurriedly rushed out and it was cold so we didn't eat it ,bearing in mind this was  an eleven hour flight. Offered a single glass of wine out of an opened bottle and coffee while still trying to finish the meal. They simply couldn't get the service done quick enough .  Limited selection of movies some of which were very old. On the plus side there was plenty of leg room but must say it looked very cramped in normal economy."
770,travelstaruk,1,"My wife and I flew from Hanoi to London two days ago. It was one of our worst flights ever, all because of a family with three, out of control, noisy young children.<br>It was evident from their behaviour in the terminal in Hanoi that they were likely to be trouble. Unfortunately they made the flight hell for several rows of passengers including us. The youngest child seemed to scream and cry for much of the overnight flight whilst the other two were running around and over their seats. The parents didn't seem able to pacify the youngest one and were obviously not concerened that their children may be disturbing fellow passengers. Also the cabin staff did not seem bothered either, even to the point of ignoring that the youngest child had its nappy changed on the floor of the aisle in the middle of the night, in view of other passengers. And allowing the children to be stood up at their seats, with the seatbacks not fully upright during the actual landing at Heathrow!<br>I don't blame the children for this. As far as I'm concerned its down to poor parenting but more concerning, the apathetic Vietnam Airlines cabin crew!<br>We will not be flying with them again."
771,Bob Bosma,4,"The cost of flying in Vietnam is amazingly inexpensive and simple.  They offer economy class only, and nearly every flight seems to be filled.  Check-in is very efficient with multiple check-in lanes, and transport to the plane is by bus.  Keep a close eye on departure times -  They do change at short notice from time to time, but the service is cordial, and adaptable to changes and missed flights cordially."
771,paulnjanice,3,First review of an airline:  We travelled out on Premier economy and this was well worth the extra. Roomy seats with loads of extra leg room and a foot rest.<br><br>On the return flight these where all booked and we travelled standard economy.  Here three by three seats take up the same area at two by two seats in premier.  The condition was extremely cramped with no leg room and when you had your lap tray down you could not move at all.<br><br>This maybe OK for a short haul but not on an 11+ hour flight.  Shame on the airline for saving an extra inch here and there just to get an extra row on the plane.  have travelled before with many airlines but can't recall any being this restricted.  I wold not travel with this airline again unless it was Prem Economy.  Be warned.
771,robert_bos53,4,"Modren equipment, rapid check in and boarding procedures, on-time arrival were all part of this domestic VN flight.  Good service on board, within the duration of a flight of about 1 hour.  I opted for an upgrade at a hugely reduced cost (25%) but then learned that it does not give me access to the business class lounge in the domestic sector of the airport - fair enough, but something to be aware of."
771,LeNgocTram,4,"On my trip to Singapore, I choose VNA since it is reasonable price and very comfortable. The schedule is convenient and the price, surprisingly, become cheaper and cheaper since this airline has to compete again Vietjetair.<br><br>Food is nice and the service is surprisingly good compare to the price range."
771,silkyrat,3,"I was very excited to fly with the new dreamliner from London to Saigon. Plane itself was really nice, seats comfortable, I loved that they give you slippers and not just socks for the flight. The food was very uneventful, service hit and miss, and IFE system in my seat on return flight was not working (at least I had a reason to sleep). Food choices for a vegetarian/pescatarian are one of the worst I've ever had on a business class flight. Flight attendants knowledge of the English language is not very good. Return flight was over an hour delayed. All in all, comfy flatbed seat and a good night sleep. At least they don't overcharge for what you get like many competitors..."
772,nikaiyo,5,"Flew non stop LHR to Hanoi then on to BKK.<br><br>I booked the flight as it was VERY cheap. But decided to take a chance as the long leg was on a new 787 so thought it could not be that bad.<br><br>The leg room was great, and the flight almost empty, so had a full block of 3 seats to myself!!<br><br>The flight was on time, food was... Airline food so it filled a hole. They serve Vietnamese Pot Nnodles as mid flight snacks!<br><br>The only criticism was the inflight entertainment was lacking choice. Maybe 10 movies total.<br><br>Would use again without hesitation. The iPhone checking worked fine."
772,What We Found Travelling,4,"On our tour to Vietnam we flew with Vietnam Airlines on seven different legs.  They were surprisingly good. On the long haul flights the food was good as was the service.  The planes whilst reasonably clean, there were a few bits &amp; pieces broken &amp; all the planes seemed older than 5 years.<br>We only had one flight with issues.  VA emailed me the day before our flight to advise that our flight from Pho Quoc to Ho Chi Minh was going to be late by 2 hours, so we adjusted our arrival time to the airport to suit the new flight time.  When we got to the airport to check in the agent told us we've missed the flight as its due to take off in 10 minutes.  I showed the agent the email from VA, &amp; as their english was poor, simply told us sorry bad luck &amp; you'll have to pay extra to book another flight.  I protested heavily, &amp; then we realised there were a number of other people who received the same email, 14 people in total.  We all then knew that VA had overbooked the original flight (jet engine) &amp; just wanted to force us onto another plane (turboprop).  Our ATR 72 turboprop plane had only 25 people on board plus 1 cabin crew &amp; 2 pilots with a capacity of about 80 seats!  No problems at all with the plane or the flight on the turboprop.  However, we weren't impressed with VA scam to shift passengers, we were a group of 6 &amp; the other two groups had 4 people each. Finally, I wouldn't hesitate to fly with VA in the future irrespective of that scam issue."
772,thepipefishfans,4,"Quick check in ,friendly staff,comfy seats ,ran on time ,clean ,very pleased with all the flight we took in Vietnam"
772,Cholla H,3,"I’d like to share my terrifying experience from Vietnam airline's ""rude male passenger’ with everyone for awareness and for Vietnam airline team for improving customer safe&amp;convenience as lack of attention on every passenger especially before landing.<br><br>I flew from Melbourne to Ho Chi Min on April 16,2017 on my own.&nbsp; My seat no was 29C&nbsp; (Im not sure what exactly no. was 29 or 28) and there was an empty seat on 29B while 29A was seated by a woman. <br><br>About 15 mins before landing, 29A woman went to toilet so I sat alone at that time. One man came from behind my back and tried to have communication with me. He did not speak English which mean I did not understand what he want. He used his body language and pointed to above luggage storage then pointed the empty seat. I asked in English “What do you want? Do you want to get your luggage?” Instead of answering, he pointed to me then pointed to empty seat meaning that he wanted to sit on my seat. I kept asking him in English what do you want as this seat is belong to me and the empty seat was full of blankets and water bottles of me and 29A woman. I tried to look for staff but it was none. He was there still standing and forced me to move from my seat! I scared and feel uncomfortable and thought that he may just want to get the luggage. So I moved to empty seat even it was hard to sit properly and could not use seat belt because the stuff of mines and woman were on the seat, also my right hand was holding a cup of wine. Then he took my seat.&nbsp; Luckily, 29A woman came back from toilet and she needed room to walk to her seat. I took that opportunity telling her in English about what happened. That man had to get off my seat to give way to 29A woman and that was when I take my own seat back. But he was not give up and trying to sit on my seat. 29A woman described to him that the empty seat was belong to her friend who booked but could not fly on time. That man seems upset and walked back to where I did not want to look. <br><br>But this was not the end. <br><br>After landing, that man came again to hurry get his luggage above my head.  I can feel that his luggage and handbag were deliberately pushing me and he sat on my armset.<br>I did not response his rude behaviors because I was scared and wanted to avoid any troubles.<br><br>Anyway, I agree that it was my fault that I move to the empty seat, I should have ask for help from staff at the moment to communicate with that man. <br><br>I am writing this complaint to you because if any staff had looked and came to checked properly on passengers at that time the man take my seat, I would have asked the staff to help me instead of deal with bad situation on my own"
772,Julian H,2,3 of 4 flights were re-scheduled few days after booking via website. Lost a day of holiday as a result.  Web-checkin not working with Android  (requires FlashPlayer). Least seat space compared to all other airlines (less than Ryanair etc.) If you get a seat in front of the emergency exit. ... seats are even smaller (touching the knees with 180cm height). No multimedia or individual screens. Overall: disapointing!
773,FLMetro,5,"Vietnam Airlines is one of the nicest airlines I have ever flown.  The staff is very easy to talk with and very pleasant.  You can check two or more bags as long as you do not exceed 20 k which is great instead of mandating the number of bags.<br>They are very stress free for security and on the flights. All the flights were internal so they do not serve food but they give you a packaged wet towel to clean your hands and a bottle of water. All my flights were on time and my baggage arrived, in good shape each of the five or six flights I took."
773,Kathryn D,4,"Travelled from Vientiane to Phnom Penh.  Comfortable short flight - fully booked.  <br><br>Very surprised to receive a meal - nice and fresh cold meats and salad and cold drink.  They were even about to serve coffee, but then got message that cabin crew were to take their seats for landing, so that didn't happen!  Full marks to the cabin crew for clearing everything up in double-quick time!"
773,WorldTraveler,5,"We live in Singapore and have traveled on Vietnam Airlines on numerous occasions. I have to admit I wasn't sure what to expect the first time around, but I have to say I am very impressed. The flights were all on time, check-in was fast and efficient, service on board great (they even served a very tasty hot meal on the rather short flight from Singapore to Hanoi), the leg room on the plane is good. Can really recommend this Airline!"
773,charlenechannn,1,"Both my outbound trip from Hong Kong and my return trip from Hanoi sucked.  Worst airlines service you could ever get.  Unfriendly ground staff at the Hanoi Airport with very bad attitude and just does not want to fix their machines that were not working.  Also funny when staff at the check-in counter who put me on aisle seat without checking with me, and then insisted that she won't change it back to window seat just because ""aisle is better"".  Funny in flight experience too - flight attendants ignored my question and pretend she didn't hear me.  Also when I asked for a blanket, flight attendants said nothing's available, but later someone in front wanted one, she passed him two. <br><br>It was simply a very bad experience, with a carrier that I do not want to fly with ever again."
773,BC_Sydney,3,"Based on the security processing problems we've seen at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where security was scrutinising every domestic passenger we decided to get to the airport early. The taxi ride only took 30 minutes and by getting there early we were fortunate to be assigned exit row seats. Had some VND left, so we had a bit of a look at the shops and eateries at the airport. What we've found is that everything was priced in USD. Having been to HCMC, Da Nang / Hoi An and Hanoi during this trip we weren't expecting to see prices displayed in USD. Sort of reminded me of China in the 90s when there were two different types of RMB – one for foreigners and one for locals. Anyway, found everything much more expensive at the airport so do your shopping before the airport.<br><br>Boarding was slightly late and we left the gate but ended up de-planing about an hour later for a ‘technical issue’. <br>The technical issue resulted in a plane change that would see us departing at 6:00AM with a plane that was being brought in from elsewhere. I was actually glad to see that there was a plane change and that the airline has put safety first. We were provided with water, blankets and a sandwich while we had to wait the 5 hours. While back at the terminal I tried counting the non-Vietnamese passengers and were able to count 5 including us. This is a new route that has only been in operation for days before our flight and what we found is that the flight was filled with group tourists. Should have known better to take a flight on a new route from a SE country. Passengers were very vocal about the ‘technical issue’ and of course all in Vietnamese. Ground staff were showing stress and forced smiles by the time people started settling down – a good hour later. <br>As promised we boarded again at 5:30AM. Once on-board however we find out the plane had a different seating configuration (with a premium economy section) and the seats we now have are not exit rows. Took a while but managed to move back to exit rows.<br><br>This is where it got interesting.<br>Before take-off we've observed people lying across seats, and once we took off, we had a passenger lying on a blanket in front of the exit row. 40 years of travelling and this was the first time I've ever seen anything like this. Passenger was returned to his seat by a stewardess about 30 minutes later. We also had feet coming through the gap between the seats - I've seen this before on long hauls but not by grown adults and not where people were sitting in front.<br>Asked the stewardess to ask them to stop to no avail and gave up by putting blankets between the gaps.<br>I’d say this could be attributed to Vietnamese tour groups taking advantage of the new route from Hanoi to Sydney at promotional prices and also the cultural differences in standards and not across what acceptable behaviour is. <br><br>Like the Sydney to HCMC flight all the cabin crew disappeared after the first meal was served and a bottle of water was handed out.<br>None of them were to be seen afterwards and although I seldom do, I had to press the flight attendant light which wasn't attended to until much later and even then never got what I asked for – a glass of water for my wife.<br>Had the feeling that the Vietnam Air flight crew felt they were much better (off, travelled, whatever it may be) than the people they were serving. This might be true, but from a customer service ranking perspective I’d put them close to the bottom.<br>Never ask a steward as he’s in his own league. The stewardesses appear to be much more accommodating. I understand the airline needs stewards to ensure safety as whatever the stewardesses say are ignored by the Vietnamese passengers, but they do need a lesson in customer service and that even if a request is from a woman it’s probably best to oblige.<br><br>Overall it felt like a flight from the past and even then I didn't have to endure much of the antics seen on this flight on domestic flights in China back in the 90s."
774,Carolyn D,4,"Although we were only on the flight for about 1 1/2 hours, these guys were professional. They were actually as pleasant and helpful as the flight attendants on Cathay Pacific or better! Kudos to you Vietnam Airlines."
774,John D,5,we arrived at the airport with our E-ticket only to find out that the flight had been cancelled completely -- now the rush of panic set in. <br>But we have to give Vietnam Airlines the biggest wrap ever - we were put on a flight to Saigon; put up for the night and then picked up and taken back to the airport for a early flight onto Da Nang.  <br>The staff could not do enough for us and this is the first time i have ever experienced such good service by an airline.
774,Samantha M,5,"We flew with Vietnam Airlines Da Nang to Hanoi. An amazing experience! Staff awesome in going above and beyond to make the experience as comfortable and memorable as possible🇻🇳🛫<br>I forgot a special package on the flight, called the airline from the hotel, they called back within the hour, found my package and i could collect!! Awesome experience!! Such special people!"
774,gunner25571,5,"all three trips we had within Vietnam and one from Siem Reap  Cambodia to Ho Chi Minh city were excellent, aircraft were modern and clean, staff were friendly and gave excellent service. The flights always left on time and luggage pick uf very fast"

775,Danny D,4,Overall good. However on time schedule need to improve. Seem like delay is always happen. Snack is suck !
775,Bianca M,5,"I have flown on most of the ""big"" named airlines and when we booked on Vietnam airlines I was pleasantly surprised at how they out did some of the bigger airlines in regards to their customer service as well as their food.  <br><br>Prices on this airline internally in Vietnam were also very good.  I highly recommend this airline and I will be using them again."

I was comfortable the food was fine for a airline nice planes it's a shame new planes with a dirt carpets ! but is not the airline fault maybe the people travel in !!!"
775,KA1961,5,I was not sure what to expect when I booked with this Airline but we were pleasantly surprised. I had purchased the tickets online from Airline's website. Check-in went very smoothly at Singapore airport. In flight service was good and food quality was also very good. Airplane was also new.
775,Nhu Quynh N,5,"Good quality, nice food, friendly staff, worthy of a national airline. Suitable for long flights from Vietnam"
776,Françoise B,2,"We booked all our flights with Vietnam Airlines: from London to Ho Chi Minh City, HCMC to Danang, Danang to Siem Reap, Siem Reap to Hanoi and finally Hanoi to London.<br>VIetnam Airlines had no problem charging us USD100 each when we made a change right after booking our tickets (but added 2 more internal flights to this bookin), however when they changed our internal flights 4 times before we left for our holiday, we were certainly not offered any compensation!!! I had to ring their London office on 4 occasions prior to our holiday and on one occasion, I was told that as we were flying economy, what did I expect!!!! Once, they also told me that the flight was only changed by 1/2 hour, but forgot to mention that it was also a day later!!!!! Luckily I did check and they changed our flight back to the original day. I was incredibly stressed before we left as I was extremely worried that our internal flights might be cancelled/changed without much notice whilst we were in Vietnam. On a positive note, once all the changes had taken place, all the flights were on time and the service was ok. <br>The international flight were fine and they have a new fleet of planes.  Having said that,  the in flight entertainment broke down on our way back to London!<br>If we had not had all the changes prior to our departure, I would recommend Vietnam Airlines."
776,Dan,4,"I traveled with Vietnam airlines on my holiday to Vietnam. All were internal flights (SGN- DNG/ DNG - HAN/ HAN - SGN).<br><br> All flights left on time and arrived on time. The only issue I had was that my ticket to HAN from Da Nang was not recognized my the Vietnam Airlines system. The was soon fixed up by a helpful staff member. Be warned though, their staff at the airports speak limited English, so don't expect long meaningful conversations. And depending on who you strike, you will be shifted between 2 - 3 employees.<br><br>Also on your ticket you will be told that boarding starts at XX time. When in reality is will be usually 10-15 mins after the scheduled boarding time. Still, the planes left on time.<br><br>I paid for excess luggage on some flights, but I think that the staff don't really worry about the weights too much. Even so, excess baggage charges, if purchased through their website, is only AUD $10."
776,Brian (Rick) C,5,"I fly with Vietnam Airlines regularly and they just keep getting better. It is easy for disgruntled people to write negative reviews and no airline is perfect. You won't find better value for money than Vietnam airlines the food is good, cabin crew are friendly and attentive and the fleet in modern. Highly recommended."
776,merrymusic,5,"Took the following flights:<br>London-Hanoi <br>Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh<br>Ho Chi Minh - Phu Quoc and back<br>Bangkok to London via Hanoi<br><br>Very pleased with the service.  The London - Hanoi and Hanoi - HCMC is served by their excellent Dreamliner, loads of space and leg room. A plentiful supply of free drinks all the way. Reasonable food. <br><br>We paid for an upgrade to business from Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh at a cost of £110 for four of us.  An absolute bargain even though the flight was only two hours.  You can upgrade via Option Town.<br><br>Be warned though, in the lead up to our trip, Vietnam changed the times of our fights repeatedly which caused concern for us in that we had connecting flights to catch. It all worked out ok, but be aware that such changes occurred very frequently for us."

777,Jade L,4,"Flights were always on time, never had an issues through Vietnam.<br><br>I flew from Sydney to Hanoi,Hanoi to Denang, Denang to Nha Trang, Nha Trange to Saigon then back to Sydney.<br><br>The international flights had so much food on offer you wont go hungry at all.<br>The domestic flights you get a bottle of water which is fine as they were only short flights but a bag of nuts or something would have been good to tie us over.<br><br>The staff were so polite and helpful and i would definitely travel again with Vietnam Airlines."
777,sten h,4,"SYD-SGN-FRA-SGN-SYD Jan-Mar 2017<br>Could Vietnam become a new hub on the route between Australia and Europe? Judging by the quality of service on their new B789s and A350s I would say YES.<br>On board service attentive, food great and IFE adequate. SGN is a simple airport to transit and on layovers longer than six hours Vietnam Airlines provides a hotel room (with transport and meal vouchers). Flat beds are comfortable with more than adequate storage. Add great value for the money to the package and success is sure to follow."
777,j0n0339,4,"We went to the wrong check in at Saigon as business is separate to economy but as my wife has recently had a knee replacement and was using a walking stick we were put into a different queue where she was asked a couple of times if she needed any assistance....nice touch,don't get that in the UK!<br>We were checked in as business passengers and got fast tracked through and into the really nice lounge with lots of eating and drinking selections available.Flight left on time and it was a good flight,seat was getting on a bit but was comfortable with enough leg room for a short flight.<br>Coming back from Da Nang we had a 4 hour window to connect with our Emirates flight back to the UK so I was a bit edgy about cancellations and delays.We found the correct check in this time and once again my wife was asked if she needed assistance and we were checked in and fast tracked through to the lounge where we seemed to go back in time.It reminded me of a school canteen with very little choice of anything,even the coffee was rough! Strange thing was there was a brand new lounge connected to it that was shut which looked very nice.<br>Our flight was shown as on time but the flight from Saigon an hour before hadn't landed yet so alarm bells started ringing and eventually our flight was shown as delayed 1 hour and 20 minutes.That was still enough time to get our connection so just sat and hoped it didn't change.It didn't. Took off at 8.20 and were in the international terminal by 10 with two and a half hours to spare.<br>Have to mention that Vietjet and Jetstar were delayed or cancelling flights all over while Vietnam stuck to the schedule but were just running late.<br>I like Vietnam Airlines and the price is good.The concern they showed for my wife was off the scale and not something you see much of in the UK.It was my own fault I didn't stay in Saigon the night before with an unprotected connection so I should give them 5 points but the lounge at Da Nang is pretty ropy (they're doubling the size of the airport so the new one will probably be spectacular) and the delayed flight knocks them down to a 4 but next time I'm in Vietnam I'll be flying with them again."
777,Nick P,5,No problems with Vietnam Airlines - hassle free check in - plenty of in air meals and drinks.  Friendly cabin crew.  Will fly with them again.
777,Beverley E,5,"First time flying with Vietnam airlines and after reading reviews had my concerns! but my experience is very good...staff very attentive, plenty of drinks offered, food good and snacks available on request.

778,kevin c,5,"We were a little apprehensive after some of the reviews we have read but there was no need, the planes were clean and tidy the food was really good and the service was excellent. The internal flights were of a good standard too."
778,FallingStone,5,"We travelled business class from London Heathrow  and returned back from Hanoi in business class. The whole experience was excellent fast track security, the lounge,  boarding, food and drink and the seats which convert to a fully flat bed. We couldn't have wished for anything more."
778,AliAzzam,4,"Flew from KL to Ho Chi Minh ,transit and took the flight to Incheon. Two part of the story, the first from KL to Ho Chi Minh. The plane was ok but it is quite a bad experience to transit in Saigon city. No proper disembarkment ,need to take the bus to the terminal and the bus driver was very reckless. Almost met with an accident and when the driver slam on the brakes ,majority of the passengers thrown to the floor. The terminal itself was hot ,no proper air ventilation ,not enough seat where some of the Vietnamese lying down and took 3 to 4 seat at one time. So get ready when you plan to transit at Saigon.<br>2nd part ...it was nice taking an Airbus a350 to Incheon, the seat spaces is much better. The stewardess are far more professional and for muslim travelers who pre-booked their Halal meal ,they served you first. <br>My opinion ,their Vietnam Airlines...their International flight was good but not their short distance flight."
778,Kimberley662,1,Bad service when we up there two hours later they give us dinner till 10 hours later breakfast omg too long to have something to eat u can have a pot noodle if u hungry lol then bottle water rant out I'm very angry a trolley not clean so dirty not hygiene I hope they do a better in future
778,travelCarlisle,5,flew economy on the Dreamliner good legroom and foodand drinks could not complain flight was on time taking off and landing entertainment was quite   good except the  music channel - a lot of unknown bands toilets  even provided  toothbrush s to clean you teeth - having  read some  poor reviews regarding Vietnam airways this was simply not the case
779,Jongleurgirl,2,"Arrived at Danang for our homeward flight to heathrow via Saigon.  At check in desk they could not find our name on the list and sent us to the ticketing office.  We were told that we had changed our flight from the 28th to 26th.  When we explained we had not been in contact with them so we could not have changed our flight and our flight had been booked by a travel agent in England so they had not been in touch to change the flight and that our local agent in Vietnam had confirmed our flight 2 days previously so we could not see how the problem had occurred.<br><br>After an hour of waiting and worrying, they could not find out what had happened, but they did allow us to fly.<br><br>What are this airline doing.  Problems on 2 of our flights and delays on most of our flights.  If there was another option I would never use them again.<br><br>Food, drink and onboard services are also poor compared to other asian airlines."
779,Jongleurgirl,2,Don't know what happens with administration but we arrived at the airport to be told we were not booked on the flight - even though we had tickets which had been confirmed and our agent had confirmed the flight with them.  We were told that the flight was full and we would not be able to fly out that night and this was because we had not boarded one of our previous flights - which we had.  They wanted proof we had boarded - like the boarding pass stub - which we didn't have.  We told them to check their system and they would see we caught all our connecting flights.<br><br>After 30 minutes they came back to us and checked us in - where the seats had come from on a supposedly full flight we don't know.  Too stressful an experience which was unnecessary.
779,John S,4,"My wife and I took two flights on Vietnam Airlines during our trip to Vietnam.  We traveled from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang and then from Hue to Hanoi.  Both flights lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes.<br><br>Because we were traveling with a group, we checked in at the group check in station.  Check in was fast and painless.  <br><br>The boarding process was fast and efficient.  They use both the front and rear exits to get passengers on and off the plane quickly.  The planes were smaller, but adequate for our modest carry on luggage.<br><br>Because the flights were short, they did not serve a meal, but did offer water and a wet napkin to anyone who wanted one.  There was not much service to speak of, but the flight attendants were courteous and efficient for both short flights.<br><br>The seats were comfortable enough.  Our planes were smaller for such short distances, so the space was adequate all things considered.  I was happy enough with the service, cleanliness, comfort and cost."
779,Damian,3,"It was a 1hr 35mins flight from Nha Trang to Hanoi. The 'snack' that was served was presented in a cardboard box about the size of a Vietnames shoe box, when opened you the got the ' big ' surprise of how little was actually inside! The ' snack ' consisted of a small bread roll with a sort of pork filling,  we weren't given the choice of "" ham or cheese "" , the second item in the shoe box was a long thin chocolate biscuit similar to the original ' Kit-Kat '. Other than those two small items - that was it! Drinks service was only a small cup of water - not even a cold coke was offered!"
779,PabloCalleja,3,Can only rate these guys as average unfortunately. Had 6 flights in total in 10 days travelling from Aus to Vietnam and around. Every airport the staff were extremely slow booking people in to the point at one stage an operator got up left for 3 minutes and came back in the middle of booking us in?? The in flight service was very good and food great but again unfortunately in flight media played up a lot.  Wouldn't fly with them again if I had the choice.
780,Cheng T,2,"We were very thirsty and asked for some water and red wine when flight attendants pass by to distributed dinner boxes and beverages for us, after the 2nd round, we would like one more cups of water because my dad needs to take some meds, however, the flight attendants just ignore us and pass by. It was really bad and unprofessional, careless, flying experience that we have ever had! Also, the entire journey the flight attendants had a stinky face."
780,Rafaela,5,"Ours was an eight hours long flight but they went 'quickly' as the staff were very friendly and helpful; the food great, with free wine if we wanted it, and the movies and music available helped pass the time. Reading the Vietnamese In-Flight Magazine, we also had time to read about the various aspects (ancient and modern) of Vietnamese culture, which presented a different dimension to the tourist pamphlets we had gathered. All and all, we very much enjoyed out flights and our visit to this very interesting and friendly country."
780,DerHenni,4,"We originally booked HPH-DAD//DAD-HAN, unfortunately the non-stop flight from Haiphong to Da Nang was canceled long before traveling and we only had the choice to take a flight via Ho-Chi-Minh City or on the next day. As we had fixed plans we took the transfer flight so that our schedule changed to HPH-SGN-DAD//DAD-HAN. <br>All flights were really good, good seat pitch, friendly staff, no serious delays (only one delay of 30 minutes), inflight service with drinks (on all flights minimum a bottle of water) and a snack on the longest flight HPH-SGN. In comparison with the price we had three really comfortable flights.<br>Unfortunately the domestic transfer was horrible. Checking through was not porrible so we had to collect our luggage at SGN, go to the transfer desk and check-in again. No problem if there would've been more than 1 counter open for economy (6 for business class, only half of them occupied). We queued for half an hour when check-in for our flight was officially closed. Checking in at a business class counter was impossible due to a guy controlling at the entrance to those, not even letting us get through in hurry. Three parallel economy counters were closed. In the end it was still possible to check us in on our original flight as there was a little delay, we went through the security check fast as a friendly official let us pass through the VIP control area (no Vietnam Airlines clerk) and we got to the gate before boarding started.<br><br>For non-stop flights I would use Vietnam Airlines again but I would never book a flight with transfer to a domestic one again."
780,ling1931,4,"Flew from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City and returned from Hanoi found both aircraft to be clean and the service given by the flight attendants  was good and helpful also the leg room was not to bad on both flights bottles of water handed out,the food was just ok,good selection of drinks on drink trolley.In flight entertainment was fair+ with both English and Vietnamese films being shown."
780,jackjarz,3,Vietnam Airlines had a seat that didn't have a lot of legroom and it was a crammed configuration in the Airbus A330. The food was good and the flight attendants were nice. Pretty bumpy flight as well. It was quick though and we didn't mind that much.
781,PeterRollett,5,Very good service  efficency staff and on time  no veggy food but staff gave us extra  stuff instead check in good also
781,TJoo,4,"Choice of movie selection: average. Some movies are unable to be played<br><br>Food: acceptable, and they prepare enough instant noodles and sandwich as our snacks.<br> <br>Space (economy seat): acceptable. <br><br>Service: generally good. Most of the aircrew are polite and helpful! <br>Except the captain of the flight who are so rude. He asked me what I want for dinner in Vietnamese Language, thinking I am vietnamese and I told him I don't understand. He replied rudely in English, saying that, you can read your menu! <br>I am shocked as, is that that hard for him to repeat in English to me ""chicken or fish""? Since he can  speak english too. <br><br>Transit: I spent 9 hours in Hanoi for transit otw back. Some find it lousy, some find it good. I managed to go to Hanoi town for a good lunch, coffee and spa and came back airport on time."
781,owlesey,5,I actually have just Do be three internal flights within Vietnam on this airline and each flight left on time with an easy and efficient check in.  After hearing some not so good experiences with internal flights I was pleasantly surprised. All planes where a good size with lots of leg room.
781,missimple88,3,"This is my first time taking vietnam airline and overall experience are quite disappointing. The seats are quite comfortable and the food they provided was good as well. However, their stewardess are not friendly when they are serving beverages or food to the passengers. Furthermore, after this trip, i found out that Vietnamese really love taking off their shoes in the plane. I met a lady who are sitting behind of me, took off her shoes and put her foot on my chair handle."
781,lynne m,5,"Fantastic airline, we flew on the new Dreamliner from Sydney, the plane itself was exceptional, we had ample leg room, the windows had a dimming switch on them that allowed you to chose the outside brightness level from a full view to a dark blue hue, the food was excellent and the movie/games selection were great.<br>The staff can be a little ""cold"" and ""standoffish"" but all in all a really good flight and I highly recommend this particular class of plane."
782,Jackie Ann Morris,2,"Mis-information, never return calls, totally unsatisfactory PA.<br>I will NOT be flying with them again."
782,nettie1963,4,"our flight was good , food, services, as also wonderful, and as for the staff, i wish we would have more ppl like them.. i would fly with them again for sure"
782,mistydianne,5,"fourth time flying with Vietnam Airlines,excellent,to and from Australia and internal flights in Vietnam.Customer service excellent."
782,jim t,5,"Only non stop service to Hanoi. Clean, comfy plane, attentive flight crew, OK food and more legroom than most planes of this level. Only niggle was trying to check in return flight online with mobile phone, just wouldnt let me, so had to borrow a laptop. Would definitely recommend."
782,chrisjap,3,"Have flown a few times now with Vietnam Airlines and almost every flight has had 'technical problems' with the IFE. If the airline can't offer the service, remove it from your website as advertised - false advertising. This is 2017, get it fixed. Service wise, not too bad, nothing to get excited over - a little curt at times and rather perfunctory. Vietnam Airlines might need to observe some of the other Asian carriers to learn a few tricks of the trade. Most likely, I'll choose another airline next time."
783,Charhugkiss,1,"On board, no earphone given. Hence I had to press for assistance. None of the service crew bother to attend to me despite me waiting for more than 30 mins, on and off. Disappointing. Lousy service"
783,adam86a,3,Slow service from the check in point. Planes were clean but dated. No food on short haul flights but that is ok. Still probably better than some of the other low fair carriers in Vietnam
783,PierreMalmaison,3,An efficient service and no issues whatsoever with the flight. Let down by slow baggage reclaim at Cam Ranh.
783,Jerry D,4,Having moved from Singapore it would appear that Vietnam Airline will be my choice. It is not the first time I have used them but with my business travel I will use quite a bit. It was a 787-9 and I had a aisle seat. The flight almost on time. good service and the meal was acceptable. Need to check out seat guru for the seating advise. I was blessed that the person in front of me did not lean back. I find leaning back is rude. I could use my laptop.<br><br>This may be the only airline that when you purchase on line they ask for your middle name (first) and first name (second). BE CAREFUL IF BOOKING ONLINE. They will make a issue when checking in that your name is not listed in the same sequence as your passport. You have to back to the service desk...maybe spend some money to resolve and then check in all over again. Nice game they play and eats time depending on the lines.
783,Sultan Of Travel 007,4,very nice service.average leg room.got water.clean cabin.no food on short haul.nice national costume.good looking aircraft logo
784,ae12a,2,"we paid a lot of money to return from Vietnam in Business Class.  Two women travelling together and it seemed that the airline felt it could do what they wanted. They split us up with seats not together but behind each other and at the back. They lied to us in Saigon about the seats.  The service was poor and by the time they came to us had run out of the food choices.  With a plane full of UK travellers why offer only 1 European choice for breakfast but 2 Chinese?  My friend was very sick on the flight and the stewardess was reluctant to take the full sick bags or assist in any way.  When coming into land at Heathrow, to tend to my friend I had to stand up whereas the staff were all sat and buckled up and not offering assistance.<br>I would not travel with them again and certainly Business class was not worth the excessive amount paid.  If going to Vietnam - find someone else to fly with"
784,roadtrip57,5,"I used this airline 4 times in a 2 week span, flying to Da Lat, DaNang, Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh city. Always on time, smooth operation, &amp; nice flight attendants. Would not hesitate to use them again."
784,James O,4,Used this airline on my visit throughout vietnam.  Very good airline . Up there with the rest. Good planes very comfortable.  Staff efficient  polite and service good. Tickets good value. Good baggage allowance.  Reliable airline would use again.  Recommended
784,inthegarden,3,Our tour group used this flight. The seat did not have any legroom. There was no entertainment source on the plane.<br>We were only given a small bottle of water.
784,Piotr_Truty,5,Very pleasant and efficient airline.<br><br>Flight and service was very comfortable and out journey in between cities in Vietnam was quick due to the number of connections and service offered.
785,Fourcampre,2,"quite basic service, limited choice on the entertainment system. Did not find the staff particularly efficient. Plane was small for such a long trip."
785,findyourzero,5,"Pleasantly surprising, its always a little scary using a airline that you dont know much about but overall couldnt complain about anything. Flights were on time, service and check in ran smoothly as did baggage collection. Wouldnt hesitate to use them again"
785,元亮 伊,2,"I could smoothly check-in. But in airplane, entertainment system doesn’t work. Cabin Crew was not very helpful.<br>Generally it's not good."
785,Larrygrace6,5,"Used Vietnam airlines for my visit to Thailand and Vietnam, had six flights all together and found them to be a very good company, I have used many airlines including Singapore airlines over the last few years and Vietnam airlines are up with them. They used the latest Dreamliner on the London routes and airbus on all other flights I undertook. I will also say we had great value for our money and 30k of luggage as we did book early for this trip"
785,Jason B,5,"Loved this flight. <br><br>From the moment we boarded to the moment we landed we had fantastic service. Staff could not do enough for you and were really pleasant. <br>We did have premium economy and the seat pitch was lovely. Pillow, blanket, slippers, wet towel, ear plugs, eye mask all made for a great flight. <br>Would recommend and I will book again"
786,jke1136,4,"My wife and I had a good over-all experience with Vietnam Airlines. We used them to fly from Hong Kong to Hanoi to Hue. Then again from Nha Trang to Ho Chi Minh to connect with our International flight. All flights were ontime and we felt safe at all times. There was a cheaper option with Jetstar. A friend travelling with us used them. They kept on cancelling flights or changing times with little notice, resulting in her having to buy another ticket as the new time did not work."
786,VinMerlot,4,"Vin and Mrs Merlot were travelling from Melbourne to Seoul to visit daughter Petite Merlot. Saw a fare Melb via Ho Chi Minh City to Seoul, business return $2,582 per ticket. Checked with some friends who had just flown Vietnam Airlines to Vietnam - recommended. Booked 3 tickets. Service friendly and attentive , excellent but given the price - outstanding!<br>Would give them the full five stars except we had seat allocation done but got to the airport and had been bumped from our preferred seats and the three of us were scattered around business class. Issue resolved at Qantas Club but seats not our preferred. In Melb Vietnam use Qantas lounge as they code share. Lost one star for that.<br>7 hour stopover in Ho Chi Minh City before next flight to Seoul.<br>Vietnam Airlines business lounge ok but not up to Qantas standard, but staff very attentive, clean and well serviced.<br>Would definitely fly Vietnam again on their new fleet including the Dreamliner and B350.<br>In fact, highly recommended."
786,Terry T,5,Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service provided. Would recommend and given the option for a substantial discount upgrade after booking economy would recommend doing so.  Staff excellent and table cloth food service.
786,Dave0363,4,"Reasonable pricing (a lot options of), recognizing for Sky Priority Elite and Elite Plus members, feeling of safety, nice on board service, etc. As resume - fine option for traveling inside Vietnam as well as in Asia region at all."
786,Anne_Marie_49_11,3,"Choosed to book flights om the homepage. Very easy to book and cheap. Used them twice in Vietnam. Laste flight was 1 hour delayed, but got informasjon by email in good time."
787,bfg62,4,"new a/b 787 still deciding about herringbone style B/class seating but plane and service great , staff attentive and friendly. Considering price 10/10"
787,Rachel T,1,"I really enjoyed my VN flights.  Here is the thing, I bought 2 tickets from Vietnam Airlines directly.  The first ticket I was charged $30 more than I agreed to pay when I gave them my Credit Card number.  The 2nd ticket, I was charged $4.85 more.  The e-mail confirmation that I received did not include the price.  Check the amount of your Credit Card transaction when you receive your Credit card bill.  <br><br>Now I will review my actual flights.  The Flight Attendants were lovely.  The leg room was spacious for economy.  They even served a meal on a short flight and it was ok.  There was no extra charge for baggage.  I would have given this airline 4 stars if not for the sneaky overcharge.  There is definitely something fishy going on."
787,Abby928,2,This is flight number 3 and all three have been delayed by a number of hours.  Definitely will never fly the airline again. It's a misery whether you are on business or leisure.  Not the way to build customer loyalty.
787,LC1954,5,"Firstly let me say that Vietnam Airlines has the BEST and easiest booking service I have ever used, (and I use a lot as we do quite a bit of travel, which I always arrange).  They have three classes, business, premium economy and economy.  You can pick and chose which class you wish to travel, they have the cheap as chips economy ""special deal"" then for the three classes there are a variety of fares, ""save"" (much cheaper, but non refundable), """"standard"" and ""Flexible"".  Initially I chose Premium Economy save on the way over (day time flight), and Business save on the way back (night time flight), however, after reading the reviews on PE decided to upgrade to Business.  Business lounge was good for variety of food and drinks, priority check in and customs made check in a breeze. The plane was brand spanking new!! No shades on windows, they darken themselves.  I loved the business class pods with all  the bells and whistles.  Staff were lovely, as was the food (I had pork medallion with herb crust, fresh potatoes, carrots and beans) and selection of drinks. Opted out for the dessert and cheese plates as too full!! All in all, both flights to and from Vietnam were excellent. Domestic flights were taken to and from Da Nang airport, again, chose economy as it was only an hour flight, plus, the last time we flew business it consisted of being given two economy seats each!! Good service and great flights.  Planes were on time, no delays.  Would not hesitate for a moment to fly with them again.  Excellent all round.<br><br>I normally would have used Qantas, which is my preferred airline, however, as I would have been put on the EXACT same flights (they code share international flights to Vietnam), and the QF system does not allow you to pick and chose across the classes of travel like VA, it would have cost us an extra $3000 plus; and quite frankly, I didn't think that paying that price for FF points and status credits was worth it."
787,F4023NZalbertos,2,Not as i excepted! Like the flight from kansai international to hanoi noi bai the business class is really bad! I hard in some flights the business is very good! I can confirm this by reading tripadvisor! And saw pictures on vietnam airlines wedside! Unfortunately i was too unhappy with vietnam 🇻🇳 airlines! Hope the will improve their service and aircraft from kansai international to hanoi or hcmc!
788,BatonCanelle,3,We had several domestic flights in Vietnam and had last minute changes from Vietnam airline. We tried several time to contact them and it was a total nightmare.<br>Language issues and extremely non flexible.<br>I will certainly hesitate flying with them again.
788,Shayne K,4,"First time flying Vietnam airlines recently and thought it was pretty good. Rode on the Airbus A321 which wasn't too bad, a little older and smaller aircraft. Served a meal on a 2 hour flight which was nice. Left on time and biggest thing of all..... it made the flight SAFELY! Other than that it really doesn't matter. <br><br>I would fly them again if the opportunity arises."
788,warren D,4,"I have flown this airline twice, once in business class, once in economy. The service was very good on both flights. The attendants take pride in their service. The seating in economy is not cramped like on many US airlines. The food served is par for the airline course. Beer, wine,  are  complimentary. I found it a little warm in the airline. I will fly VN Airlines again."
788,249juhar,3,"Aircrafts are basic (airbus A321) short route airplanes. We (2 adults &amp; 2 children) flyed from Bangkok to Phu Quoc, via Ho Chi Minh City and back. 4 flights all together. This time we made it trough. Our changing time at Ho Chi Minh were supposed to be enough, but all flights were more or less delayed. Which was lucky for us. Thanks to the very helpful ground staff. English language should be learned a bit more.<br>But if you want to be in time at destination, this is not the airline to use. <br>I always wonder how quick they serve any kind of drinks or meals on these one to two hour flights?"
788,TayRuong,4,"Small premium for business class is worth it for the services you get in large airports (HCMC especially), but not for the seat you get on the A321.  If the passengers in front decide to recline, they are in your lap and you cannot get out of your seat.  Worse that middle seat in economy."
789,Desmond8000,3,"I was on my journey on flight No: VN30, from Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City on Business Class.<br><br>After a few hours into the flight, I had pressed the call button. I waited for about 15 minutes and no one responded. I noticed that the Chief Purser walked passed the other aisle, either she did not notice the call button or completely ignored the call light. I pressed the button again and finally another flight attendant showed up 15 minutes later. I told her that I had pressed the call button twice and waited for such a long time and this kind of service is really bad. <br><br>Then the Chief purser came to me and told me that, since I had complained about the bad service, she and the Captain, have decided that I should not be served any beverage and/or food the entire flight. The Chief Purser not clearly demonstrated her authority but was absolutely, rude, arrogant, lazy and obnoxious. She did not have any grounds to suspend service to me. I was not rude, drunk, violentn unruly or abusive. Since when Vietnam Airlines allowed their crew to make such decisions. After that throughout the entire flight I did not get any food or drinks.<br><br>As you can see from my record that I have flown Vietnam Airlines on many occasions and I must admit that service is usually good. I had never encountered any bad service crew such as this. I did write to the airline and subsequently got an apology from the Director of the Cabin Crew Services. Subsequently when I wrote it and asked them how I will compensated for being staved &amp; mistreated on board their flight, I did not get a reply at all. My email was conveniently ignored<br><br>This is no way to treat a Platinum Elite customer both in the air and in terms of customer service. I wonder how they got a 4 star airline grading"
789,easterntreker,4,"Excellent service , very friendly. The food was very good , considering such a short flight. Flew all over Vietnam with them and always on time.. only negative is they don't check seat belts for landing...children were out of their seats."
789,akmbum,3,"Very poor service in the airports, delayed flights, poor information shared with customers, gated keep changing, had to use them for 3 flights from Feb 15 to Feb 25, can't prebook online continually get error messages, seem very disorganized as a company"
789,Michael L,4,Enjoyable flight which left on time. Aircraft clean and good service. The cabin crew even managed to serve a good salad lunch in the 75 minute flight. I would be more than happy to fly on this airline again and am happy to recommend.
789,Alan D,3,"Great new aircraft and plenty of friendly crew on hand.  The food during my flight was quite good however there could have been slightly more on a long sector.  There was a limited choice when it came to drinks and when served I was given half of a miniature bottle, these was even on the first drink.  In flight entertainment was adequate.  The temperature on my flight was very low to the point I was uncomfortable even with blankets wrapped around me. Summary, a somewhat uncomfortable flight due to the temperature and light food."
790,Paul G,2,"We had purchased a resin statue in Vietnam which had been packed very well for air travel, but when we arrived home the contents werent just cracked they were smashed to pieces. Whe trying to claim back from the airline they advise that there was nothing they could do as we should have checked the item before we left the airport."
790,Kat T,5,"Flew economy cabin on an A321, departing DAD in the morning and landing in HPH just a bit before noon. Aircraft was full. Vietnam Airlines seemed the only carrier to offer this route (went for Haiphing rather than Hanoi to see if there was a close base to do day-trips to Cat Ba and Ha Long Bay) but the pricing was decent: a bit above 700k VND (around 31 USD) in total. <br><br>Check-in and boarding in Danang were fine. So too were deplaning and baggage reclaim in Haiphong. Both airports' terminals were very compact: it takes minimal time to get from counters to gate to baggage carousels. The only slowdown encountered was upon exiting Haiphong terminal arrival hall, when staff would check your reclaimed bags for tags and then collect the baggage sticker check-in had originally slapped onto your boarding pass. No idea what purpose taking the sticker serves -- it was the first time I had seen stickers being collected. It may be to double-check that travelers had reclaimed the right bags, though this created a bit of a bottleneck at the door.<br><br>Onboard, cabin was clean and staff service smiley and efficient. As the flight was only about 1 hour in total, no drinks &amp; snacks. Also no individualised AVOD --- you watch your safety video on the shared overhead small screens.<br><br>Business class seats on the A321 looked very big, 4 abreast. Travelers who on N American airlines may be asked to buy two economy seats for their own single use should find comfortable the business seat on that aircraft.<br><br>Would certainly fly with this airline again. In fact, already booked."
790,TravelManiaxxx,4,"Airports in Vietnam can be very crowded. That is why it is absolutely worth paying extra for Business Class. You will pass airport formalities very quickly. On short routes like SGN-CXR they have very limited on board service i.e. water, soft drinks and beer but real Business Class section and seats. We also had CXR-SGN route."
790,Timo J,4,"Our first time for Vietnam Airlines, and the experience was all positive. New Airbus A350 was very clean and even in turist class leg room was Ok for long fligth. (11,5H).<br>Staff was polite and always ready to serve. The food was typically airline food, no suprises. The entertainment system was easy to use and movie selection was very good. Fligth landed to Saigon on time. We bougth our tickets from edreams, so vietnam airlines mobile app did not work, so we needed to print the tickets, which was unnessesary. Not fault of Vietnam Airlines?"
790,lanhamumc,4,"Great service, nice seat, food was OK.  On time flight.  Very pleasant cabin staff.  Modern aircraft.  Good choice."
791,brian c,5,"The 787 business class is a huge improvement over the aging A330's that used to do the haul. Flat bed, big screen, good privacy, good food, great service and exceptional value. Welcome to the 21st century Vietnam Airlines"
791,Chris500,4,"During the month of February, 2017, I flew with Vietnam Airlines several times throughout the country.  I had heard horror stories about this airline, but none of them were true when it came to my flights.  Clean, comfortable and all safety procedures were followed.  It's cheap!  No frills.  You get a bottle of water.  For what I paid, it was a great value.  Check-in early with them because their flights are booked solid.  I highly recommend you fly with them and I will do so again!"
791,daines51,4,"Very good check in experience at Heathrow airport. The aircraft was as good as any major airline ( no disrespect to Vietnam Airlines ). Good legroom, acceptable comfort level of seat. Smaller selection of major movies  but for the price that was ok. The food was good ( for airline food ), with good portions. Staff  were very nice and attentive. All in all a very good experience for a very good price. Flew in on a 15 day ""no visa"" stay and was through Immigration in minutes."
791,Bui T,3,"pleasant domestic flights , service quite good, staff friendly and helpful enough. but sometime they have delayed in short notice, you be aware of that. they serve food on board, but rarely i and my family could eat all their food. <br>in conclusion, it is still the best domestic airline when you travelling within vietnam, compare with other budget airlines Jetstar and vietjet. <br>hopefully they will improve the service to deserve the name of national airline."
791,Peter S,3,"My first flight with this airline and since it has a good name and comes from a service-oriented region my expectations were rather at the high side. However, I soon learned that it was just an average airline - the Dreamliner is not my favorite aircraft, I am annoyed by the lighting, thin seats and since it is a relatively small plane it is not so stable. Staff were rather rude, the food acceptable but not sufficient to make me full. The entertainment system seemed to work smoothly but I only used the airview. Departure and arrival were on time. Very strange was that the self-printed boarding pass (check-in on Vietnam Airlines site) was not accepted at boarding so I had to queue for a new one, and again to get access to the waiting area - which was completely empty, no restaurants, no drinks, NOTHING!"
792,F4023NZalbertos,2,I was surprised in see the business class in such a terrible conditions! No entertainment functions! The seats were in mierable conditions! Broken and old un cleaned! It is a nearly five hours flight! Service was poor! Seeing the flight attendents playing with the smartphone! Newspapers few! Food low quality! Despites this flight was more expensive then ana/ china airlines / asiana! Will never take again! But on my return have no choice to take this miserable plane!
792,the_heron16,1,"Flew Osaka (KIX) to Hanoi and back. Old and mechanically noisy aircraft with entertainment system down both ways, fluff balls and crumbs on the floor between the seats, foot rests not working, toilets not cleaned in days (judging by their state and smell) and the worst food and coffee I’ve had on any airline. Staff were pleasant but unable to enunciate English, making the announcements unintelligible (“fa’ow,” apparently, means “five hours.”) In brief, a shambolic and shameful contrast to Hanoi’s gleaming and efficient new airport and Vietnam's exquisite food culture."
792,CSMiddleton,4,"My first flight on Vietnam Airlines and it exceeded my expectations. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Especially after getting through check in at Beijing. <br><br>The new 787-9 was a welcome after flying up on an old A330-200 qantas crate. (Entertainment system with small 4 inch screen).  The food was very passable. Soya bean salad, seafood noodles washed down with a very generous pour of French red. The lovely attendant waved away the little glass and filled a large offering. Got to love that. The plane was full and the service quick.<br><br>The staff then helped me all the way thought transit. Super efficient.<br><br>Definitely happy to fly Vietnam airlines again."
792,Katharina S,1,"Vietnam Airlines is a great airline providing reliable and in business class luxurious and plesant services. We fly on our Vietnam trip business class throughout. But to Con Dao we had to change to economy class, there is no other on this stretch. What we were experienced was terrible. We checked in one hour prior to boarding. Instead of boarding we were said at the gate that the gate had changed. There we waited with the repeated information that the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. The SGN airport screen did not show any information. We waited without new notice for 3 hours, the Vasco and Vietnam Airline personal at the gates knew none. Finally we returned to check-in after we found out that the plain (sceduled to arrive at our check-in time) never had arrived in SGN. After waiting and fightingw together with an angry crowd for information and new ticket we were located an other 3 hours in a desmal hotel  (one star, 15 US$ per night) crying over our night n Six Senses in Con Dao. For us its clear a mother(Vietnam Airlines) not caring about her daughter(VASCO) will not find us again under their customers."
792,John B,5,"Best value tickets direct to/from Hanoi plus two internal flights.  My partner flew in Premium Economy, I sat at the back with the rest.  It was TET (Lunar New Year) so all flights were full.  The cabin crew on both international flights worked hard throughout, keeping everyone happy, especially all the families attending the holiday celebrations.<br><br>The main meals were ample in Economy and there were snacks/drinks available either by calling the cabin staff or walking down the back and asking at their food station.  I had no problem getting top ups to my glass of red wine whenever I wanted and even managed a reasonably decent sleep in the economy seats.  <br><br>So the cabin girls wern't a bundle of laughs but they worked really hard to make our flight as pleasant as possible - and I felt that given any sort of problem with the flight they would have worked as hard to ensure i was safe.  I don't ask for any more than that.  On the inwards flight there was an issue with a few of the ICE screens, so the cabin crew shuffled the affected passengers around the cabin to much amusement so everyone who wanted too could continue watching their films etc. - never seen that before!<br><br>The 787 Dreamliner Vietnam Airliners use on this flight was spotless and kept spotless during the flights - even the toilets, not a pleasant task given the airplanes were full.  i liked the little touches such as toothbrushes/paste and various hand creams in the toilets.<br><br>But whoever the Boeing designer was who put the call buttons on seat armrests needs his contract checked!!<br><br>My partner reports the Premium Economy cabin exceeded her expectations, and she slept well in both directions.<br><br>Our two internal flights both left on-time, had efficient cabin crew and the aircraft were clean and everything seemed to work OK."
793,discover12,5,"We traveled on Vietnam Airline from Singapore to Hanoi, Hanoi to HO Chi Minh and from Ho Chi Minh to Singapore. All three flights were on time Seats were comfortable, service was excellent and efficient .Although these were all short flights, meals were served on every one of them with complementary wine. North american airlines can learn lessons on how comfort and service can go long way in impressing travelers."
793,chitownsam,3,Flight and seats were ok.   Food was almost nonexistent.  3 tiny openfaced items.   No wine offered.   Also had to ask for a soda water.   Only regular water offered.
793,ssvikas,5,"Flew on three flights operated by Vietnam Airlines during my last vacation. It was nice to know that Vietnam's state run Airline has such wonderful service standards. This flight was a boing 787 Dreamliner and after boarding, I was delighted to know that I was allocated a seat in the business class. Only hitch was that although they had screens, there was no content/ choice in the in-flight entertainment system."
793,John P,5,"We booked our flight on line with Vietnam Airlines; and we were advised of changes in departure times, even when these were minor (5 minutes). The ticketing procedure was simple and the ticket price reasonable. <br><br>Our flight did what so many other airlines cannot, beginning with easy check-in. The flight departed on time; it arrived on time; and the in flight service was excellent. Comfortable seats, nice meal and good service.<br><br>We will happily fly with Vietnam Airlines again!"
793,189vassilis1960,3,I have traveled many times with Vietnamese airlines and there is always at least one hour delay to the departure time.
794,Gun-Nat,5,"Always a joy to fly Vietnam Airlines. Polite staff who can't do enough for you.<br>Good, tasty food even on short flights."
794,HugoColle,4,"I took this airline few times already, international and national flights. Its good, you get a good service, friendly staff, food and drinks are ok. I mostly take business class on Asian short flights, price isnt that expensive and you have good seats with sufficient space to feel comfortable. Would take it again anytime."
794,Emily O,5,"I have travelled on Etihad, emirates, Virgin, Singapore airlines, and many more....This was by far the best service I've ever experienced. Such polite and friendly crew members, it was the most enjoyable 8 hour flight I've had! Looking forward to travelling with them on the way home :)"
794,chitownsam,3,"We had a very short flight between Siem Reap and Danang.   There was no boarding announcement at that gate,   We just happened to look and see people were boarding.   There were only about 35 people on our A321 flight.     Service was minimal in such a short flight.   No problems."
794,Malarchy,3,Vietnam Airlines is the Vietnamese flag carrier.  It is the major mid-budget carrier within Vietnam as well as offering international flights.  The fleet does not seem to be the newest and the in-flight experience is average at best.<br><br>Seating was acceptably comfortable.  The economy class cabin has reasonable leg room and the seats are comortable enough for a 3 hour flight.  Service was fine.<br><br>Unforunately it seems screens are not available.  For a short internal flight such as Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang that is ok as an hour or so is fine for a family on a plane.  For a 3 hour international flight it is a bit of a disappointment not to have some visual distraction.<br><br>The food was average at best.  A 1 hour internal flight comes with just water.  A 3 hour international flight serves a meal.  The vegetarian oriental meal was sweet and sour with tofu. It was ok.  <br><br>Boarding is advertised 40 minutes in advance which is a bit earlier than actually takes place.  There was a little delay on one of the flights but nothing too serious.<br><br>Check-in at HCMC international side was easy and effective.  Flying domestically was more of a challenge with a huge queue and then another long wait to get through an incredibly busy security screening area.<br><br>For flying within Vietnam this is a decent option though there are budget carriers which may well offer similar quality.  Internationally it is a bit of a disappointment and the lack of screens make it a bit of an endurance challenge for a family with small children.
795,fort-ham,4,Pleasant staff and service. Food could have been a bit better but for such a short flight this was not a major concern.
795,John O,3,"I couldn't recommend the business lounge at the airport. Seating uncomfortable and very mediocre lukewarm food. The meal served on the flight was advertised as ""rack of lamb"". In fact it was bone and grizzle of lamb and was the worst meal I've ever been offered in any class on any airline! When I complained I was offered an alternative but as it was 01.30 I declined. I chose the Vietnamese signature noodles for breakfast and that was delicious."
795,John O,4,Very pleasant service and good food. The flat bed was comfortable with plenty of privacy on the single window seat. Baggage handling at Hanoi was slow.
795,Natee S,4,On time nothing to complain. usual service as international flag ship maybe the best domestic airline in Vietnam when compare to others who are normally low cost airline
795,Alexander R,4,"Service is awesome, seats are comfortable, personnel are friendly and helpful, thanx. <br>Several flights were late, all four of them, to be precise. ""Sorry, it's due to late aircraft arrival"" and so on."
796,itscuddles,4,"Flight from KUL to Hanoi was good, service was good, food was decent for airplane food. Flight was on time. <br><br>However, flight from Hanoi to KUL wasn't that great in terms of service. Asked for 3 blankets, however was only given 1.<br><br>Overall its a good airlines with a reasonable price tag."
796,Tomasz P,4,Price for two way ticker not expensive. Flights on time. Nothing to complaint about that.<br><br>The only one minus is horrible snack - sandwich that they served. I have no idea why they give people something like that - on both ways I see that most people just smelled it and leave. Only desperately hungry decide to eat. Lol.<br>Small things but should be changed.
796,Alexa R,5,The staff at Singapore Changi airport were extremely helpful. We almost missed a flight but they kept check in open for us an extra 10 minutes as they knew we were on the way. The flight was comfortable and service was great. Recommend this airline when flying in Asia.
796,amanda b,1,After already experiencing a late departure from can tho to phu quoc 12 hours but at least we were pre advised about that one decided to check our next flight at least 60 hours in advance only to discover this one had been delayed almost 12 hours as well without any notification. This meant we would be arriving in HCM after midnight we had prebooked a very nice hotel and late night tour earlier for this evening so it was imperative that we arrive earlier. Hotel tried to help with no luck language barriers were a bit of a problem. Travel agent we had earlier used for tours said Vietnam airlines should change flights for us but he tried without any success. By this time it was Saturday afternoon we again tried on Sunday witnout any success so decided to purchase another flight with Jetstar (thats another story). When we arrived at airport for our Jetstar flight approached staff at Vietnam Airlines to be rudely advised that our VA flight is now a Vasco flight and has nothing to do with them. Well sure enough our original flight which was VN8802 was now saying VA8802 I dont know whether this is a regular ploy of VA who have shares in both Vasco Jetstar and another but I am disgusted in the whole episode and because of this our holiday went from about an 80% holiday satisfaction to about 30% and thats not good enough for my hard earned money so I will never ever ever return to Vietnam again. Because I point blankly refuse to have anything to do with VA ever again. Luckily our flights to and from Vietnam were with Singapore on time almost to the second.
796,Lennox W,4,A 14 hour overstay 0530-2100 and a 4 star Hotel thrown in. Also there was a free<br>tour of Ho Chi Min City. <br>Flight on time. Food O.K. with Asian menu as well as western options.<br>The media consul left quite a bit to desire. <br>Service was excellent . H.C.M Airport was large but not crowded.<br>Price was very competitive .
797,GibbsesFamily,5,"We flew return Sydney Saigon and also did 3 internal flights. Vietnam Airlines was lovely to deal with, efficient and all our luggage arrived with us and intact. I would definitely fly with them again."
797,snoopy647,5,"Booked our Oct 2016 flight 2 months in advance and the price was amazing. We booked an economy ticket for a flight that was 1 hour and 20 minutes for a cost of 679000 VND per person including taxes. That cost converted to $40.00 CDN pp!! We thought that was a heck of a deal when we consider flight costs in North America. Check in was quick and efficient as we only had 1 carry on bag. Flight was comfortable, and although our flight was delayed, we were still happy we had chosen Vietnam Airlines."
797,Chr15t1n3,4,We have flown Vietnam Airlines several times. All experiences have been good but I think we've been delayed every single time.
797,Ausmochic A,1,"On 11 Jan 2017, they cancelled the flight due to ""weather"" in Hue, but you can google weather in both cities are fine, they just lie and find an excuse not fly half empty flight, after I purchase the ticket, they change the schedule twice, last one only 2 days before departure via email. I spoke to people in Hue they all said the weather was perfect on that day. Worst of all, ground staff no one cares, try to put us on another flight to another city Da Nang then pay our own way, more than 3 hours taxi  for Hue around midnight in a strange city. We refused, the station manager Mr. Le Manh Linh show us the Policies, he was rude and unhelpful, ask us to go out ask taxi driver to find a hotel as their is no hotel at the airport."
797,Hervey2,5,"Thoroughly enjoyable flights from check in to landing. Staff very attentive, catering was excellent given domestic flights. No complaints at all. If long haul is as good I would certainly put them up alongside the major airlines for comfort and quality of service. Better business class than many Asian airlines on domestic flights but does depend on the type of plane your booked on."
798,hiroshi_chojamori,1,"All air plain are delayed at least one hour. and all staffs seem to be low motivation.<br>Anyway, I NEVER use Vietnam Airlines any more..."
798,Stephan B,5,"Good service in booking. A plane was delayed, and we had a connecting flight. We got perfect help and we reached the plane. We got the luggage as well"
798,Jodi L,5,"Flights were on time, plane was clean and comfortable, staff was friendly, price was right! Vietnam airlines has nothing to improve upon. The flight was short (just over an hour) but they still offered us bottled water, towlettes and blankets."
798,Gun55,5,Excellent service from boarding to landing staff so friendly as flights are fairly short only a drink is given
798,RinaSalleh,4,"It was a comfortable journey from Singapore to HCM, HCM to Seoul and back again to Singapore. <br>Opted for the Seafood Meal instead of the Muslim Meal and it was a great decision indeed.  Hot Towel were promptly provided once I was seated for all the flights. Booked my trip about 6 months in advance and it cost under USD 500.00 which was steal indeed!"
799,Annick M,5,We had a very good experience with Vietnam Airlines on brandnew spacious aircarft A350 Scarlet. The staff was very friendly with great food onboard. Highly recommended
799,Ly La,5,"We loved this company with very good service, brand-new aircrafts, lovely staff. They always try to improve their services to be better. Highly recommended"
799,George A,4,"Plane just basic interior,  you get, what you pay for cheap fares.  Service decent, efffective.  Food served surprisingly fresh and good taste."
799,Peter W,5,"Speedy check in but disappointing Lotus Business Lounge in Terminal 4. Excellent seats, food and  service on both flights, although beverage offer could have been more varied. Both outgoing and incoming flights left on time and arrived early."
799,Steve F,4,"My Vietnam Airways flight from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City (and return) was a very satisfactory experience. The staff were courteous and attentive, business class seats and facilities are very clean and comfortable and the food and drink good. The only downside for me is that the 787 Dreamliner does not have air outlets for the two centre seats. I found the cabin temperature to be oppressive without any air movement. I would suggest that if you usually get hot on flights (like me) definitely book a single side seat which does have air outlets. I will fly Vietnam Airways business class again."
800,noushymoo,5,"I was expecting the worst after hearing about domestic travel in Vietnam but I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to check in at Da Nang airport with Vietnam Airlines, everything went smoothly and we were even offered an earlier flight but had a transfer waiting for us so declined but really nice of them to ask. I was emailed the day before to say our flight had been delayed 45 mins which was great and I emailed to ask if I needed to reprint tickets and they replied within an hour so great service. The flight was comfortable, we were given water, maybe a little snack would have been nice! Da Nang airport was great, plenty to look at, different choices of food, good bookshop and plenty of touristy shops if you missed out so far in Vietnam! Would definitely fly with them again."
800,MPIngrid,4,"Good airline, but for to make sure you get your connection-flight, calculate min. 1 to 2 hours extratime."
800,skaldoften,5,"This weekend my wife and I had a flight with Vietnam Airlines from Hanoi to Fukuoka, with a layover in Ho Chi Minh City. Due to a mix-up, we missed out flight to Ho Chi Minh City. But the staff put us on the next available flight. <br><br>When we arrived in HCM City, an employee met us as soon as we got off our plane. She sprinted with us from the domestic to the international terminal, making sure we got through customs and security quickly and found out gate. We made our connecting flight with only minutes to spare. If not for this outstanding act of customer service, we would have missed out flight to Fukuoka and been set back half a day and several hundred dollars. <br><br>We cannot express enough how happy we are with the service we received. We will definitely book with Vietnam Airlines again."
800,Freddieepicawesome,5,Very good! It has personnel monitors with games and loads of epic latest films and very good service and tasty food!!!!!😄
800,Helio C,4,"Affordable Business Class, good service and food, reading material, clean and comfortable seats, on time flights."
801,Robert499,5,"Quick Flight Da Nang To Ho Chi Minh ,Vietnam Airlines has more  Legs Room than other Airlines Not only in Business Class also Economy ,from the time you Check in to In flight Service Vietnam Airline does an great job to make you Comfortable and Enjoy your flight as a  Frequent Traveler i can Thoroughly Recommend Good Prices Plus no Hidden Costs ,Excellent Job Vietnam  Airlines ,See You Soon"
801,Benjamin B,2,"Their premium economy service is pretty crappy compared to most I have tried.I accept you can't expect business class standards without paying the $$ but all you get for extra cost of premium economy with these guys is a wider seat with more recline.....this is important but other than this you get nothing else. No priority boarding, same food as economy and no amenities pack. Return internal flight from Phu Quoc to Saigon got suddenly changed from 11am departure to 10:30pm on NYE! Had to pay extra to get flight to be in Saigon before midnight to celebrate. Found staff to be consistently unfriendly particularly on flight from SYD to HCM."
801,Kshacks,2,"I have to say there are mixed feelings about this one and whilst there were some pluses overwhelmingly the negatives outweigh these. <br>Pros<br>The seats are on par with Etihad in terms of room in business class and are actually quite comfortable <br>There were a few kind female flight attendants who were extra attentive to me given I was flying home with the flu<br>The food is ok- nothing amazing<br><br>Cons<br>They are incredibly disorganised and never board on time <br>The majority of the crew and ground staff are rude and unhelpful<br>As we had to take 3 flights to come back to Australia we had to collect out luggage each time (which was slow and disorganised) and clear customs on each occasion<br>Whilst we flew out of an international airport the plane landed in a domestic in Hanoi, we then had to move to their international airport at Hanoi for the one internal flight - which doesn't make sense<br>They won't check your bags all the way to your destination so you have to continue clearing customs and checking them in for each leg - in a country know for theft and bribery and corrupt boarder officials this is a harrowing experience and when your sick it's 10 times harder<br>When you ask for only certain items off the menu they still bring you a full tray - which is a waste as you only eat what is originally said<br>There is no water bottle provided till it's time for you to sleep so if you are sick like I was and had medication this is an issue<br>They are slow to get anything for you when you request it and seem put out when asked<br>Each time the plane is meant to board the ground staff appear to be talking and joking amongst themselves and boarding typically is 20-30 minutes later than advised (this was the case on all 3 flights)<br>The lounges are ok, the choices are sparse and there is only local power points and no USB ports <br>One of the crew came and sat in business class next to my husband and he eats served everything prior to my husband who was left till last"
801,Jacqui B,3,"This flight was different to say the least, there really should be a ban on transporting passages who have very bad body odour. Unfortunately the man was sat next to me and the whiff was overpowering. The staff on this flight were very brusque and weren't very polite."
801,RonA_Plymouth,4,"Our flights went via Vietnam which was a bit of a pain, probably pay the extra and go direct next time. However their ground and flight service was very good and had FOC extra legroom on three of the four flights. The only mistake I made was to get these flights through a booking agent which meant I could not check in or allocate seats on their website. Recommended"
802,René I,2,"During the booking we had a lack of information on the web-page so that we booked to much pre-paid luggage. After we received the booking confirmation and found out the mistake, we tried to get a refund for the mistake.<br><br>By Mail, Travel agent or at the airport it was not possible. We got only the information that this selected option is not refundable.<br><br>OK, s*** happens but even they don't care about the comment that there is no information on the web-page about that there is no detailed information about the included luggage.<br><br>So be careful during booking process, we spend roughly 60USD to much for flights which should us just cost 150USD instead of 210USD...<br><br>I prefer definitely VietJet Air, Cheaper and the options are described more clearly."
802,leejones31,5,"Last minute flight, good value although the price increased whilst I was booking, book faster next time.<br>Booked online no issues."
802,qbe5489,2,"Not a 4-star airline as it heavily advertised. Skytrax should be ashamed for accepting endorsements from such airlines. <br><br>Terrible service includes long delays without notice, under-average service and limited choice of food at both international Vip lounge and in-flight. I work here in Viet Nam so I had experienced a lot of rip-offs. This morning I flew Luang Prabang-Hanoi-Danang, flights got cancelled then I was moved to a different flight 2 hours after without notice. I doubt you would find a smile on the attendants' face at any time. They don't bite though but since they all come from rich families, they easily get annoyed if you get in touch with them more than once. That includes their greeting when you hop on the plane. Having said that, you don't have much choice other than this, Jetstar, which is partly owned by VN Air, and Vietjet Air. Advice: if you have to fly Airlines from Viet Nam, choose Vietjet air for early morning flights (5-7:30am) and Jetstar for the rest of the day. Do expect cancel/delay email/sms as early as an hour before take-off time or at the airport so please take off your earphone."
802,Jacqui B,4,"The flight out was quite good, attendants fairly attentive and pleasent. The seats were comfortable but not very roomy, The flight wasn't full however all flyers were cramped to gather with empty rows at the back, this made a cramped flight for us. And the flight was extremely hot. The hottest flight I have taken so far and I have had a lot of flights. Food was quite nice for flight fayre. The headphones were broken though and when I asked for a new pair so were they however as the film selection was years old i decided to just read my book. The flight was chosed by Titan travel so we didn't have much choice in the matter though. I would book again if required but would most prob upgrade"
802,Loc Tran,5,"We had an amazing experience with Vietnam Airlines between Hanoi and Frankfurt, the aircraft was very new A350 which was very confortable and spacious. Highly recommended"
803,Moreau P,5,Vietnam Airlines is a reliable conpany to travel with a great customer care service and new aircraft. We had a direct flight between  Paris and Hanoi 11h flight on A350 Scarlet which was very confortable and classy
803,Janne H,4,"I do a fair bit of bsuiness travel around the world and is lucky enough that I normally fly business class. I booked this private trip through Momondo and this was the cheapest ticket I could get. As such I prepared for not being very good but I was pleasantly surprised. Comfortable seats, good food &amp; selection of drinks (incl. alcohol) and a good selection of english movies. The staff on the flight was very friendly and provided good service. Can't ask for more than that."
803,Brian (Rick) C,5,"Well done Vietnam airlines. The new planes are a huge improvement over the old A330's. Full flat bed, great service, great food, makes that 8 hour flight a joy. A word of note if you are flying from Australia to Vietnam don't get the Qantas code share as you'll end up on the same plane at twice the cost. Keep it up Vietnam Airlines, you've done very well."
803,Sarah C,3,"I sat on a 10hr plane ride, and it wasn't that amazing in my opinion. The food was... slightly better than the other airlines. I had the seafood meal, which was rice with prawns, and highly undercooked bok choy, The only snacks they provided were chicken cup noodles. The seats in economy class were awfully cramped. And the entertainment set were of the older slower model - which wasn't the touchscreen kind but the button kind. Also, they did not provide special kid packs for the children. Thankfully, there no delays and our plane reached on time! The flight was quite smooth"
803,RebelTravel,4,"Price was not bad. Clean cabins, decent leg space, decent selction of films and a very tasty vegan meals both ways. Helpful crew as well. Only problem I had was that I had to google how to order vegan meal with them and then had to send an email to book it rather than having that option with the booking straight away. So far happy with the service provided."
804,brook t,1,"Don't be fooled by the glossy ads for the world's latest four star airline, when it counts this outfit is third-rate and third-world, with the worst customer service I've encountered in 35 years of flying. We have just spent two drama-filled hours arguing with the business-class staff to be allowed to check in for our flight because we had changed an earlier leg - successfully - through the agent to which their site had directed us because it took us back across the country for no reason.Can only describe the resulting experience as Kafkaesque - their computer said no and there was no way we were going to be allowed to disobey it - imagine dealing with the Vietnamese bureaucracy must be like this. The impasse was only resolved - as it would have been right at the start by any reputable airline, given all we were trying to do was to check into a flight for which we had a valid, full-price ticket - when we threatened to call the embassy if they refused to honour our booking and kept our luggage. <br>For the rest, and to be scrupulously fair - which is a great deal more than they deserve - the cabins and lounges are plausibly business class - not great, but not as revealing as the entertainment offering, which is very poor and the food, which is ordinary, surprisingly given how good Vietnamese food is normally. It's the customer service that is Soviet. What a way to leave  country - ruing the day you came here."
804,fourfivesix,4,"We were a party of 3 adults, flying from Hanoi to Hue in December 2016. We took the 7:35pm flight and were pleasantly surprised that there was only a 15 minute delay. The seats were comfortable with generous leg-room (both my husband and son are 6-footers). <br><br>Apart from a wet tissue and a bottle of water, no other inflight services were offered, but it was a short flight and it was nice be left alone. <br><br>Take off and landing were smooth, felt safe, no drama.<br><br>We checked in online and received an email to say that we should get our boarding passes printed out, though they did give us a proper boarding pass at the airport counter. Check with your hotel that they can print for you, just in case it's really needed."
804,LadySarah9,5,"To be honest, this airline is way better than I expected. Good food, excellent customer service and it was a comfortable flight (except for the little boy who was kicking my seat throughout the flight)."
804,fly fly away fly,1,We were scheduled to depart at 17.00only departed at 20.00 the ground staff were not appologetic they were not bothered at all we were not offered any vouchers we eventually take off after 20.00 and we only get a bottle of water worst airline
804,Glenn_Egan_Perth,1,"3 times this pathetic airline has changed our flights! 7.5 hour schedule times for an internal flight! Pathetic really.  Won't ever fly this airline again! Voted Airline of the Year...ha, they must have paid for their nomination!"
805,Gratefultravels5,3,"Flew Vietnam airlines from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh, then to Hanoi. From Danang to Ho Chi Minh, and then back to Melbourne. I booked and paid online via their website. Only one flight was changed by half an hour and they gave us a couple weeks notice of this! They helped us with transfers at HCMC. Everything else was on time, check in was easy and overall service was good. We flew economy so seating and reclining space was limited. The entertainment system is good with lots of movies to choose from. The new dream liners are clean and modern but basic in economy. The food was pretty bad but there is plenty so you can find enough to eat, and for us it was only an eight hour flight at most. If the food was improved I'd rate it higher."
805,Steve J,4,"Nice commuting in-country service.  Flew a couple of flights whilst in Vietnam on Vietnam Airlines, both identical in service, plane type, class of flying (economy), and outcome.  Flew first from Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang, then from Hue to Hanoi.  <br><br>On both flights departure was on time, check in was efficient, sky miles were noted and awarded, boarding and deplaning were well organized, and the bags showed up when we did. Additionaly, both flights arrived as scheduled. Since both flights were domestic and short haul. no food was dispersed, and only water was served. <br><br>For domestic service, they are on par with the better US domestic airlines, and superior to many in regards to inflight service.  FA's were well trained and tidy in appearance.  For short haul commuter flights, they'd be hard to beat in-country.  Price was pretty darned reasonable too.  <br><br>I liked them enough to give them a shot on a long haul trip, and would definitely try them again on domestic."
805,Reculvers,5,"Lots of space in business.  It seemed that my husband received better service than I did.  I had to ask for water.   He just kept getting his drinks refilled without asking.  Limited movie choices.  First meal was good, second meal was not so good.  For the price this was well worth it and we will absolutely fly with VN again"
805,Edd,4,"Very pleased with the service. <br>Flight on time, brand new airplane. Cabin was clean, service good and catering was fair and clearly above other airline standards. Will be among my short list for our next flight to Vietnam."
805,Mtoko,5,"I heard lots of negative reviews about cancelled flights etc. We had no problems, friendly crew and modern plane with lots of leg room. Hassle free"
806,Bespoke Vietnam Tours,4,"Everything was good. Staff was friendly and the seat was pretty comfortable. However food was not good. I had egg for breakfast in the morning and it was oily and made me sick, so i vomited, the rest was fine. I enjoyed watching the movies and listening to music."
806,Brits_In_Busan,4,Second time we had done this trip to Saigon from Busan and could hardly fault the crew as they were very professional and also warm and helpful. Food was edible but nothing fantastic and entertainment was good as well as seat comfort. I would fly Vietnam Air again
806,fireysunrise,5,We flew from Luang Prabang to Siem Reap and were quite satisfied with our flight. Service was good and the plane was clean and comfortable. They allow one free checked bag and at 30kg it is more than the other airlines servicing this area.
806,dumplings_n_grits,4,"I am sure that this isn't always the case but I was very pleasantly surprised when we left and arrived 15min ahead of schedule. The staff managed to get all of the passengers onboard and seated ahead of schedule and we took off early. The staff were pleasant but no special extras. We all received one bottle of water on this short flight. The checkin was fast and easy, and we all received a free checked bag."
806,Avital H,4,Fair service on this short flight that actually left before time and arrival much before scheduled..
807,Niek S,4,"Our second flight took us from Hanoi to Hue.<br>This flight also left and arrived on schedule, with service comparable to that of EU/US carriers<br><br>I am still more than happy to fly with Vietnam airlines, so far."
807,Niek S,4,"The first of our flights with Vietnam airlines within Vietnam took us from Ho Chi Minh city to Hanoi.<br><br>The flight was punctual, service was good.<br>The Airbus A321 airframe is showing it's age, but will still get you from A to B comfortably, swiftly and safely.<br><br>The crew is attentive enough, even when faced with culture/language barriers."
807,Susana,5,"First time fliyng with this airline and we did not know what to expect. Service was great, staff pleasant, and there was a choice of oriental or western meal (for each meal), which I found thoughtful. The toilets were clean and stacked with toothbrushes, hand lotion, razors, etc."
807,Brian P,5,"I booked two Business Class tickets from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City for myself and my Vietnamese friend using the name I have known him by for many years. Unbeknowns to me the name on his ID card varies slightly so at check-in he was summarily refused a boarding pass on the basis of this alone. And I guess in the current climate not totally unreasonable.<br><br>I appealed to the duty manager to intervene and fifteen minutes later after several phone calls to my friend's employer and University lecturer he was issued a boarding pass. Lesson learned.<br><br>Once past this barrier, the business class lounge was better than that of some larger Asian airlines I've experienced and the on board service couldn't be faulted."
807,Marlynne P,2,"We bought Business Class tickets from Japan to Hanoi, on to Hue, then Saigon. We purposely purchased B/C so we could move the tickets around. There were torrential rains in Hue, so we decided to cancel that portion, stay in the north, then fly to SGN. We called their help line repeatedly, only to be hung up on 6 times!!! We finally got an agent who gave us completely wrong information and we followed it. Unfortunately, it cost us quite a bit in cancellation fees, since she refused to ""change"" our flights. Their ticketing office was also unresponsive after an hour diversion to actually go talk to a person face to face. Much time &amp; effort went into it and they were very unhelpful!<br>The actual flights we took were good. Nice staff and clean airplanes. Just horrible customer service!"
808,Donnac82,5,"Early morning flight from HCMC th Rach Gia , it was on a little twin prop plane , its the smallest plane i have ever been on but it was a good experience. Take off was on time and we landed ahead of schedule. It only cost €25 each one way which is very cheap."
808,terranova7777,1,"As the review title suggests, my issue with this airline was their lack of communication in flight changes and delays. Case in point - 4pm flight being delayed practically every day of the week (see image). Will be shelling out $50 more to go with a competent airline next time."
808,Mtraveler8,3,"Decided to take a quick trip to Saigon with VN in Biz to get some mileage before year-end and to keep the Skyteam status. Skyteam Lounge in HK is modern but the food quality is terrible. No quality drinking water offered and overcrowded. Boarding in HKG was tedious with a bus from gate 524. Herded-like-cattle-experience and no priority boarding for Business Class passengers. Once onboard the A321 with Skyteam livery departure was on time and settled in well with refreshments and towels offered. Cabin crew were friendly but not more than they had to, seemed to lack enthusiasm. The flight was smooth and the weather was fine. No PTV's onboard so generic cartoons were shown on the overhead TV's, the plane seemed to be quite old. Decided to skip the meal as it was mid afternoon but the food looked good from what other passengers enjoyed. The seat was spacious but only very little recline. Upon arrival in SGN a private coach for Biz passengers was offered which was quite a relief. Plenty of immigration counters were available at Saigon airport, so only a short wait, that was good. Luggage arrived after 10 minutes of waiting. Overall, an average experience for the money spent. Seems VN is trying hard but there is certainly room for improvement. Skyteam really ought to improve the HKG Lounge experience."
808,Oldjack,3,"The plane, an A 321 e[was clean and left roughly on time and arrived on time without incident.Service was standard with not a lot  of smiles but they served a drink on the 45 minutes flight. Baggage arrived as expected."
808,Richard N,4,"All the 'usual' things about this flight were above average; leg room, comfort, inflight entertainment, etc.<br>There was however one very significant and worrying event:<br>After all the passengers had boarded the Aircraft. I was approached by a member of Vietnam Airlines ground staff who requested to see my Passport. I handed the lady my Passport who without permission or explanation took a photograph with her mobile phone of the page with all my details and photograph. She then left the aircraft.<br>I am extremely concerned that my very personal and confidential information can be taken in such a manner without my permission or explanation.  Should I have any identity theft or other similar issues raised at any time in the future I would be naming this occurrence as the most likely source of any illegal action.<br>Please advise the EXACT reasons for this breach of my confidential information and your guarantee that I have repeatedly requested an explanation from Vietnam Airlines, but I have not received any response."
809,ian f,3,First time I have flown with this airline. It was only a 2 hour flight and the seating was comfortable with a decent amount of legroom. Staff were attentive however the food which was offered was not really acceptable being well below the standard set by European airlines which sometimes is not all that great. Limited availability from other airlines means you will probably be forced to fly with Vietnam Airlines if travelling in this area of Asia. Could be worse.
809,andrewluc,4,"good services,nicely and useful staffs,the time for checking quickly and i don't need to wait for delay as always like jetsta..."
809,LeavesdenMan,4,"We upgraded to economy deluxe (premium economy) via option town - a third party company, seems very odd way to upgrade, but it worked. The upgrade was worth it for the money for the extra leg room and separate cabin. Had amenity bag and slippers, chair was wider than economy. Food was same as economy and basic - a shame. Ran out of gin after just one glass, have seen this on other reviews here.... However large range of entertainment and comfy seats. Staff were pleasant if slow to respond to request button. All in all pleasant flight."
809,Darinullah,4,This is the first time for me to travel by Vietnam airline. Seat pitch is wide enough and food on board is quite good. I travel to Tokyo via Hanoi. From Bangkok to Hanoi the aircraft is A321 and from Hanoi to Tokyo aircraft is Dreamline 787. <br>Flight is on time. And the service is good.
809,Alan_Sue94,2,"Had read other terrible reviews about Vietnam airlines, I admit it was better than expected BUT on the outward leg the whole section sent their meals bad as they were cold.  However , the meal you got back wasn't the one you had originally and wasn't much warmer despite the attendant having the biggest pair of oven gloves I have ever seen. But the food was reasonably tasty<br>The in-flight entertainment system was working properly and didn't have a great selection of films.<br><br>On the return leg, the attendant sneezed over the trolley as he was serving food then proceeded to wipe his nose on his sleeve then carry on serving,<br><br>Food and drink was thrust at you by un-smiling attendants, Vietnam airline definitely need training in customer service."
810,dariandoreen,5,Great very good flight plenty of room good service really enjoyed staff great comfortable seats plenty of leg room
810,Thomas Reprich,5,"What a pleasant surprise. Uber friendly ground and cabin crew from the get-go. Flying on the Dreamliner is an added bonus, but when the crew started pouring post take-off beverages from silver urns, I was gobsmacked. It took me back to the days when flying was still fun.<br><br>The crew continued their impeccable service throughout the flight and we arrived in Frankfurt surprisingly refreshed and ready to continue our journey. Thank you Vietnam Airlines. *****"
810,richkathy,4,"Efficient Check in speed and access. Able to pick seat positions (get seatguru plan) Rows 18-24 are good in economy.<br>The dreamliner has a 3 3 3 combination and a relaxing high headroom with excellent overhead storage.<br>Good food provision with a 'english alternative'. Only down side, ran out of g and t rather too soon and english breakfast alternative soon ran out. Good flight and good cabin staff although strangely several were Korean!"
810,Wayne-Lambert,4,"The check in experience was pretty efficient and the flight itself was OK considering any direct flight from London to Vietnam is around 11-13 hours. The leg room was about what you would expect from an economy plane and the food was pretty good. Alcoholic beverages are available for free (well, included within the price of the ticket). There was a reasonable selection of movies to keep you entertained on the in-flight entertainment system.<br><br>The service is friendly and I think the airline is good for both international and domestic travel within Vietnam."
810,Jo G,4,"Service at both airports great even when others crossed under barriers to push in!<br>Buses transported to/from planes and staff held up umbrellas to avoid passengers getting too wet!<br>The flight itself was comfortable and on time, great seats and staff"
811,JimmyJackk,4,"One of our hops around the country, all on Vietnam airlines. All our flights were good, great service comfortable flight."
811,0°Explorer,1,"I puerchased premium economy to fly from Saigon to Paris. The Airbus A350 model uses de exact same seats in premium economy rgan in regular economy. So basically you pay hundreds of dollars for a pair of sleepers and a few more inches more than regular economy. So not waist your money, book an economy ticket or a business if you are in that tier, but skip premium economy, not worth it"
811,asiachad,3,"Flew on the new A350 which was very quiet, however that was the only positive. Seats really uncomfortable and the seat back tv was next to useless. Who does the staff training?... better service received on local low cost carriers."
811,Phạm Thanh V,4,"I had a pleasure flight with VNA. The food is good, the cabin crews are nice and polite. I like new uniform much, it makes the crews dynamic and smart."
811,breweruk,4,"Really nice flight in a new 787 Dreamliner. Good isle seat on the end of a middle row of three. Good legroom. Very clean. Toilets spotless. Staff friendly and attentive. Left on time, arrived a few minutes late due to holding pattern coming into HCMC. Efficient and well run service. The food for this under 2 hour flight was modest. A ham bun and a custard tart, but it was okay. The seat back entertainment system didn't seem to have been activated, but that's probably because the flight was so short. The drinks trolley serves water and soft drinks, no wine available. But everything else was good. Vietnam Airlines has really improved over the last few years. Oh, and one other point. An earlier flight on my trip was rescheduled. As a result I missed the connection. No problem, Vietnam Airlines promptly issued a refund. Their customer service people are very good. Recommended."
812,Jan K,5,"Flying with Vietnam Airlines in Premium Economy in a  787 Dreamliner was a dream. My husband's special dietary requirements were well catered for and my food was delicious.All the comforts of a long haul flight were provided after we had a transit tour in Ho Chi Minh city. The break between flights gave us time for a rest,shower and dinner. The staff on board were helpful and friendly. I cant recommend Vietnam Airlines enough and will certainly fly with them again"
812,perfect_spy,4,"I wasn't going to get the painfully slow bus to Da Nang or a cramped train. A one hour flight, despite at the ungodly time of 7am was perfect. A great airline who I will use again on my next trip here."
812,davidharris1985,1,"OK until things go wrong.<br>Vietnam airlines made me pay 3 times for the same flight!<br><br>I booked 2 returns tickets in line<br><br>1.Hanoi check in refused my partner because I had not written her Vietnamese middle name in the booking. ( there was no option on the website). The Checkin Clerk said cheerily that I had to go to the Ticket Office and amend the Ticket<br><br>2.  The Ticket Office refused. I had to buy another Return ticket. And they sold me the wrong  return flight.<br><br>3.On return, at Da Nang Check in, the clerk spotted the error and said Cheerily (yes you  guessed) that I had to go to the Ticket Office and amend the Ticket<br><br>4. The Da Nang Ticet office refused, offered no options and genuinely thought it  was OK to leave my girlfriend and Fly off on my ticket. Lots of blah about regulations cannot do anything etc.<br><br>5. Finally, she agreed that I  actually I could By a 3rd Return ticket<br><br>This is the first time I flew with Vietnam airlines and my impression was of incompetence, total lack of care, no imagination and she bloody mindedness.<br><br>The actual  flights were fine but Never, ever ever again will I fly with these brainless amateurs"
812,Robert T,4,"Excellent flight! <br>On check in we were offered an exit row without asking and without extra cost! <br>Aircraft was clean, cabin staff friendly. Short flight but full lunch service and then another snack and drink before landing in fact these guys do more actual work in a 3 hour flight than an SIA crew do in a 10 hour flight!!! <br>Great arrival formalities at HAN!"
812,MiaEJ2013,4,"Flight was on time, clean cabin, good service. Choice of Asian and Western meal. Staff could do with some English lessons, but were attentive and service-minded. We also flew with VA from Hanoi to Frankfurt and some domestic flights. Worked fine, always on time, smooth boarding procedures."
813,lucki_girl,3,"First time with Vietnam Airlines - the plane from Sydney to Ho chi Minh was an older style of plane. Interior looks tired and worn out abd tired, however it was comfortable. If you are like my partner - who's 6 ft 4, consider spending money for the premium economy - the leg room is worth the extra money. Staff are helpful. Bring your own entertainment tho, it has 8 movies to choose from, no music to speak of, and no tv series."
813,AnjC48,4,Thank you for a wonderful flight and service. The customer care was exceptional. I will definitely travel with your airline again.
813,Muthannah88,4,"Booked a flight from KUL to PEK Via HAN with Vietnam Airlines with almost 12 hours layover. Chose Vietnam Airlines over AA after given some thoughts on price and service. For this sector, they used B787 dreamliner, which is a fleet newly introduced to Vietnam Airlines family.I was not sure with check-in process in HAN since both flights was checked-in in KUL. However, boarding process was smooth. Flight attendants were not really friendly but helpful at all the time. English command was very minimal. Before take-off, we were given a refreshing tissue. The seat was comfortable. It could be reclined to a certain angle which I don't know. Leg-room was okay for me but not for westerners. In-flight entertainment was available - magazines, built in screen with a variety of films, audios, televisions, electronic reading materials, and real-time flight information. The built in screen was more sensitive if compared to the ones in Malaysia Airlines, and didn't get frozen suddenly. An attached controller can be found next to your armrest. A headset was given before take-off and should be returned before descent. The windows were dimmable. There were blankets upon request. Meal consisted either Beef or chicken? (I chose beef), bread roll and butter, salad (very nice for this sector if compared to the ones I had in flight to FRA before), and fresh fruit. As for drinks, there were red/white wine, beer, carbonated drinks, milk, juices, coffee and tea. Drinks will be given after meal as well +/- salted peanuts. PA system was quite bad as I barely could hear the announcements. Other than that, nothing much to complain. Luggage claim was smooth. As far as I can see, they are trying their best to satisfy their customers and to me they live up to their 4-stars airline award. Definitely will fly with them again - for their price and for their service."
813,Helena M,5,"I was very well impressed with this airline. Modern airplane, good food on board and well equipped in terms of entertainment on board. I flew from London to Hanoi and also took 2 internal flights. I will fly with them again."
813,Badger01_12,4,"A very short sector between HCMC &amp; Phnom Penh so it made me wonder &amp; I still am unsure now if the time waiting at airport, checking in, going through customs, flight delay with weather we wold have been better of taking the bus. Maybe next time when we take the bus I will be grateful that I took the plane!<br>The flight was very full, the plan was an older type &amp; was quite cramped but being on the plane for such a short time it was ok.<br>Once again a bus to/from the gate, staff ok. Not the worst airline I have flown with."
814,Jay P,5,"The service and food were good. Cabin crew were friendly. Legroom was better than other Airlines flying in the same sector. When we were coming back from Hanoi to Kul, we were carrying pumped breast milk since my wife is breastfeeding mother, due to local regulation rule, we're not allowed to hand carry the polystyrene box which contains milk and they told us to check in the as luggage. But the airline staff did arrange the box to be hand carried by their staff to the aircraft as the box might go into pieces while on the conveyor belt. I will definitely fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
814,sally a,4,"Good journey and would certainly fly with them again. Flew on a dreamliner and found the journey comfortable. The staff were friendly and attentive. The facilities were good although the inflight entertainment was a bit unreliable. I haven't flown long haul for a  number of years as my experience had been very uncomfortable, this flight has made me reconsider and I will consider another long haul flight with this company. I am 5' 8"" with long legs and there was adequate room without feeling squashed - if you have shorter legs I think you will have plenty of room for a comfortable flight. The inflight meals were also tasty and well presented. I can't really comment accurately on value for money as I was part of a tour and all costs were amalgamated - howevermy instinct is that the flight was vfm."
814,Ralph Wilhelm,5,"Much better than expected.  This is not a third rate airline at all; planes, service, schedule, technology put it very near the top.  Flew business class for approximately 5 to 6 hours and very comfortable.<br>Electronics on board for the cabin crew was more high tech than I have seen in any other airline cabin (330 or 350?).  Steward and stewardess well trained and quite adequate in English.  I would not hesitate to take them again."
814,Relativestranger,4,"We choose this airline as we wanted to fly direct on a budget.<br>Couldn't fault them at check in London side, got there early to ask for extra leg room as my husband is 6'4"", no problem.<br>Flight was on time, food was really nice, service impeccable.<br>Only downside, communication problem on return check in meant we didn't get extra leg room."
814,Bob293916,4,"A short flight and everything was operated in a professional, smooth service.<br>The plane was a modern Airbus and very clean.<br>The cabin staff spoke excellent English and were very courteous."
815,Alex K,3,"Small airplane, clean and good enough. Air hostesses polite in great costumes (maybe the best i' ve ever seen). Good flight and great destination if you travel Indochina (Luang Prabang, Laos, direct to Siem Reap, Cambodia,) but expensive."
815,LynneOz,5,"It was a short flight and all went well. Very polite staff. Even though a short one, we were given a box with an apple, peanuts, a roll and water. Left on time."
815,chilnguyen,4,"Everything was average, from the seat, check-in process to in-flight service. <br>But it means LOW standards compare to other national airlines. <br>.<br>Many of the staff are from the North of Vietnam who were famous for having low service mind and being very ungraceful. One was talking to my younger brother with a superior tone. I know not all flight attendance behave like this but it was very annoying."
815,David M,2,"We had three flights on this airline over about 2 weeks.  This one, the first was canceled, a major headache.  The next one was ok but the cabin staff was odd - they handed out water and hand wipes then never collected garbage.  The third flight was delayed by an hour.  Try some alternate to this airline if you can."
815,ctiny22,1,I flew Vietnam airline 2 years ago and my round trip was delayed both ways.. whatever it happens.. this time we went to 4 different cities and all 4 flights were delayed! Get it together people! They were unorganized and although very nice people it was very annoying and killed our day just waiting around.
816,Ninja grooves,4,"Cabin crew is nice, service is OK, food is OK, clean, quiet new fleet, I really have nothing to complain about a half dozen times I flew with Vietnam Airlines.<br>Code share flights with more than 20 airlines."
816,FreddeSwe74,5,"Three trips with Vietnam Airlines and all of them been a nice experience. Nice standard on the planes, nice to have some food during lunch without having to consider paying for it. Modern planes and check-in and everything else worked out well.<br><br>The the only negative is small leg space but that is to be expected in Economy so not poorer than other airplanes really. It was odd to have your own TV screen during such short trips but as we had it we would expect that they worked (error on one trip) and that it was possible to see something else than a welcoming text circulating for the whole trip."
816,Marjolein A,3,Not too bad but also nothing special. They do still service a full meal even on a short flight. Staff nice but english could be better. Space not too bad giving into consideration that most asian carriers have very small seats in comparison with a Western body. Flew from BKK to Saigon and from Hanoi to BKK again. Went on time
816,LakeEireOhio,4,"Clean plane, pleasant flight attendants, and new aircraft.  This was all we needed for the quick 45 minutes flight to go see the Angkor Wat Temples.  The only issue is that the seat are close together for those of us who are 6' tall."
816,fdiazrod2016,4,"The flight was delayed more than 30 min. However, the crew was very nice. The international airport is amazing, brand-new and has several gift shops to make the last minute buys from a wide range of prices, from a 6 USD tea mini set to the most expensive 50 USD and higher. There is also places to have lunch. The food in the airplane is very good --like everywhere in Vietnam-- so do not have a heavy meal earlier. The airplane looked very new. Finally, my congratulations on the stewardesses uniform, a modernized version of the traditional dress in light green and creme colors that reflect Vietnam."
817,The Travel Ninjas,2,"We are extremely disappointed with this airline. Vietnam Airlines has no regard for their customers and the fact that some of us like to make plans on the first day of our vacation. <br><br>Initially, we were scheduled to arrive in Nha Trang at 10:00 AM so we booked a half day tour that afternoon at 1:00 (plenty of time to check in and get settled). Well, the night before our flight we receive a text stating that our initial flight has been canceled (for no reason other than they didn't sell all of the tickets they wanted for this flight). They changed our flight and we were now scheduled to fly out a couple of hours later. <br><br>Then later that night we receive another text stating that the 12:00 flight has now been scheduled (again for no reason) and we will now be flying out at 17:00 instead!! <br><br>So they just ruined an entire vacation day just because they decided that not enough tickets were sold on the earlier flights so let's just cram everyone on the late flight. Not caring if any of us had any plans or urgent tasks that needed to get taken care of at our destination. <br><br>The worst part is that if we, as the customer, want to make any changes we will be charged a full ticket price to make changes but they can make changes any time they want without any consequences. This is extremely unprofessional and flat out rude! We have lost confidence in this airline as they have pulled this crap on us before causing us to lose money for last minute cancellations of our scheduled tours."
817,CesarettiDaSpoleto,5,"First time on a 787, pleasant flight. Food was served at good temperature and staff looked after me. Vietnam should have chosen a different controls layout: lights and screen controls are in he armrest and can be easily hit anytime resting the arm to the side"
817,EJP_Sunshine,2,"I was not impressed with this airline.  I flew first from Heathrow to Hanoi - check-in staff didn't understand request for window seat, on-board catering very poor, one food option ran out by half way through cabin, no gin although some was found later.  2 internal flights both fine.  Flew home from HCMC and again only one food option by my turn (Beef noodles for breakfast!) and crew unable to understand a basic request for alternative.  Onboard entertainment ok with large choice of films though most very outdated.  Would not recommend"
817,dianecalladine,5,Very friendly staff nothing was too much trouble food and drink was all free and very nice. Blanket and pillow was provided and some up to date films to watch. All in all good flight will defenitly fly with them again
817,worldiscoverer,4,I had flown the airline a few years back from Nha Trang to HCMC and it was ok.<br><br>But this time I flew round trip BKK-HAN-BKK and what a fab experience. Both ways managed to get the emergency row which added to the comfort. Both ground staff and inflight crew were very pleasing except on the return leg they had a new joinee checking us in and was being trained on job making us wait quite a bit.<br><br>I am a frequent traveller and normally preorder my meals or just skip them for obvious reasons but must say this airline had one of the best inflight meals I have had in a very long time.<br><br>Don't miss onboard coffee either.
818,john t,4,"A long but comfortable flight, with friendly crew. Arrived on time in Hanoi. Food on the flight was not the best culinary experience."
818,228Kevin,4,The short flight from Hue to Hanoi was good. The staff were efficient and friendly. Seats were comfortable and I had enough legroom.
818,perfect_spy,4,"A very busy popular route that was pretty much full. A good airline, smooth flight. Very happy to use again."
818,James D,5,Don't usually review plane operators but felt necessary for these guys<br><br>5 star food service cleanliness with amazing in flight gadgets to make the long flight very enjoyable<br><br>Will definitely recommend and fly again where possible.
818,Pratiwi W,5,"I booked Kuala Lumpur-Hanoi &amp; Danang-Kuala Lumpur , the price is amazingly cheap!<br>For DAD-KUL , I have to layover in SGN. The issue is I need to pick up my luggage and rush from domestic to international terminal to re-check-in.<br><br>The check-in staff in DAD was amazing (did not get her name). She changed my flight to an earlier flight (30 mins earlier) and put priority tag on my check-in luggage so I have more time to catch the connecting flight! And she did it without me asking, her initiative really helped me a lot. If she did not do that, I'm not sure I arrived in KUL now.<br><br>Thanks for great service!"
819,skiboywales,5,"Booked Vietnam airlines as they offer direct flight U.K. to Vietnam, no need to waste time in a stop over!! From the checkin to airlines staff we received first class service. We upgraded to premium economy which was great. The plane was a 787 Dreamliner which is wonderful. Great food and very attentive cabin crew. No reason not to book again. Just under 12 hour direct flight. Plenty of choice for films etc from you own screen on rear of seat."
819,Jason B,4,"Upgraded to premium economy mainly for the extra leg room. We got this and it was wonderful, great seat pitch, nice wide seats and good recline. <br>We got slippers, pamper back, blankets and pillow which are a nice touch, but are standard on most Premium bookings. <br>I was slightly disappointed with the food. On previous Premium we have had lovely food, served on plates, with a choice, however this was just the same as economy flights, all served in the plastic containers. <br><br>I will book again, but only if I have too"
819,Walter S,4,"Our first flight with Vietnam Airlines, VN1545 from Hanoi to Hue, was a positive experience. Our aircraft was an Airbus A321 with a generous seat pitch and width. The check-in as well as the on-board service was fine. We would fly Vietnam Airlines again."
819,paxcot,5,Was apprehensive about travelling on Vietnam Airlines but they were brilliant.   We did two flights the one between Hanoi and Hue and also between Danang and Saigon and both were perfect - operated on time and great service.    We were served light snacks and drinks on both flights.   For westerners there is not much difference between the economy and business fare and would recommend paying the difference as the service is brilliant.   We also had access to the business lounges - the one in Hanoi is lovely.
819,Flyingdogturd,3,"10/12/2015 – BKK &gt; HAN &gt; CDG return 31/1/2016 VN612 &gt; VN19, VN18 &gt; VN611<br>I was looking forward to the HAN &gt; CDG leg as VN have new A350/900 aircraft on this route.<br>Prior to booking these flights I made a few enquiries to Vietnam airlines (VN), emails to VN Australia and VN Vietnam went unanswered, only VN Thailand bothered to answer.<br>VN612, BKK &gt; HAN. A very old and tired A321 (well in need of a refit) is used on this route.<br>Only 4 PAX in business, not much to do, attendant served up a delicious beef dish to me and meals to the others, then returned to his seat and went to sleep, not a good look.<br>HAN has a nice new terminal, passing through the transit counter to the lounge was easy. <br>VN19 departure was delayed for 15 minutes while they went looking for 2 missing PAX, when these people did arrive they were very drunk, not abusive or violent, but very loud and obnoxious, they should have never been granted boarding, obviously VN is one of the few airlines that don’t have a strict no drunks policy. As business class was not full everyone else (including me) moved as far away from the drunks as possible. Not a good start and ruined the atmosphere in the cabin for the duration of the flight.  Flight attendants were obviously embarrassed and didn’t engage. Meal service was somewhat haphazard with different parts of the meal arriving at the wrong time. No turn down service is offered. Similar haphazard order for the breakfast service. 3 hours prior to arrival toilet paper had run out and was never replenished.<br>Returning VN18 departed on time. I noticed ‘Tornado’ (similar to Fillet steak) on the menu and excitedly order that. But why oh why would you put parmesan cheese on a steak.????? Pepper sauce, mushroom sauce, garlic sauce, sauce diane, even at a pinch perhaps a blue cheese sauce but not parmesan. As I’m familiar with VN now, we get the same haphazard service by non engaging attendants. Arrive at HAN pass transit and go to lounge. <br>VN611 is delayed 55 minutes, when we finally get airborne the aircraft (another old and tired A321) shakes so violently on take off it feels like it’s going to fall apart mid air, eventually – slowly these vibrations stop, and we arrive uneventfully at BKK.<br>On VN 19 (after the drunkards incident) the captain informs us that they VN would appreciate feedback (he was obviously unaware of the drunks) and invites comments via the VN website, I did so after arriving home and waited 7 months for a reply that never arrived, so I asked why, not to VN Vietnam or VN Australia but (going on previous form) to VN Thailand, the deputy director of customer relations answered and asked me to resubmit as their site was hacked and my original email was probably lost, I did so and again heard nothing for over a month, so I sent another asking if they received my second submission.  They simply replied yes, that was over a month ago now and I’ve heard nothing since, thus the delay in this review. <br>With these new aircraft VN has the potential to become a Cathay Pacific or Singapore airlines but is unlikely to happen with their attitude. They would have a good product if only they could get their act together. You could do just as well with China southern / eastern or Royal Jordanian as they offer the same service for several hundred dollars less. Even Finnair, SriLankan airlines and Aeroflot are cheaper than VN."
820,Natalie B,3,"We used Vietnam airlines for our holiday around Cambodia and Vietnam. The staff were lovely and all flights ran smoothly with only very minimal delays (normal with air travel). However unfortunately on our longest flight Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh our screen did not work and the cabin crew where unable to fix it. While it was a tad frustrating and there was not another seat for us to move to, the crew were extremely nice and even offered an iPad to use in order to compensate for the TV. As we already had an iPad we declined but it was still extremely good of the cabin crew to do so. We noticed multiple other people were without a screen too, so if a screen is an absolute essential for you maybe you should book with another airline, however for us was in the end not too bad. The food like the majority of airlines was pretty average but I don't think many airlines offer decent meals. Considering this airline is not one of the ""premium"" ones thus coming with lower price tags it was extremely pleasant and would recommend you book with them if planning a trip to Vietnam. Just a tip, if you're in transit it can sometimes be very confusing as to where your next flight however just ask staff to help 99% of the time they are extremely helpful."
820,GGGClub,3,"Ageing Airbus 330<br>old cabin layout, worn out seats, dodgy seats and a faulty in flight entertainment system.<br>service is ok<br>food and beverages are of average quality."
820,crazyguide,4,"Outdated planes, looked quite used... if not a little dirty, but it departed on time, all process went well and smooth, attendance was always with a smile... hot meal was decent, just maybe the lounge in Hanoi could use a little training..."
820,discover12,1,"The practice with many airline companies is to give you the base price and then add on the taxes and services fees in clear terms. But what I found odd about booking with this Airline website is that you don't see the total price until you complete all passenger information and method of payment. So if there is more than one passenger and you are not calculating the total amount, you could very well not notice the new price and could book the tickets before you realize the higher price. I was almost caught paying twice the base price before I realized the price difference. Another issue was that you could get much better deals booking thru other websites rather than booking directly using this company website. So shop around and don't get caught paying higher prices than necessary."
820,DiandKevGoldCoast,3,Business class type seats without frills.  Service good.  If passenger in front reclines seat there is no room for you.  Good for short travel time only.
821,Charizza Rhea A,5,"The airline definitely exceeded my expectations! For a very affordable price (116USD ) you get a full meal, Free tea, coffee, and Free wine. The seats are a little wider than other airlines. Absolutely Great service."
821,manucanuck,5,"The deal is too good to say no and despite the expensive visa application fee, decided to return to Vietnam. <br>Just remember to check out the deals on the web!<br>A short 2 hour flight didn't bother eating on the plane (sandwich)"
821,manucanuck,5,"No need to go for business class unless you need the luggage allowance. Business is around 3 times more than economy, but then you will be given an option to pay for the seat next to you, that's like having 1.5 times more spaces than the business class! So why bother!"
821,Andreak63,5,"We used Vietnam Airlines for 2 International flights Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City &amp; return. 4 Domestic flights to Hanoi-Danang- Ho Chi Minh City- Siem Reap-Ho Chi Minh City and have no complaints.Great food and I had my dietary requirements looked after. Last domestic flight luggage didn't make it connecting flight, we almost didn't either..bags delivered within 2 days.."
821,KiwiKerry53,5,"Again, we had no issues or complaints with this flight.  The flight time was less than an hour and there was no food or snack service which I have no issue with.  We were given a bottle of water.<br>Enjoyed their in-flight magazine which I think was called Heritage.<br>The plane was spotless.  Attendants friendly and helpful.<br>The flight left and arrived on time."
822,KiwiKerry53,4,"New country, new airline, new language!  We arrived at the airport to discover our flight number didn't exist on the schedule....not delayed, not cancelled, just not there.  With limited communication we were, without any difficulty placed on the next available flight, which meant a delay of just over an hour for us.  On our return home our travel agent said notification of the cancellation had come in on the day (which was the weekend in NZ) and we'd been rescheduled on a flight two hours earlier).  Given we weren't aware of any of this, things ran very smoothly.<br>The plane was modern and comfortable and much to our surprise we were promptly served a meal - I would say the best airline food that I've encountered.<br>The staff were pleasant and helpful."
822,PeteD60,4,Mid-day flight - unusual route – Hanoi – Vientiane- Phnom Penh – Saigon – we picked up it at Vientiane and flew the leg to Phnom Penh – flight was full – pushed back 20 minutes early for a flight of just over an hour – cooked meat and salad plus fruit plus coffee and soft drink for lunch – not special but welcomed – A321 – not most modern but clean and tidy – reasonable legroom – all in all a pleasant flight – thank you
822,wildeastern,5,Nice Airbus 321 .... Comfortable clean plane with good safety video explanation.<br><br>Friendly and charming cabin crew.
822,Cada R,5,"First time on Vietnam Airways and First time to Vietnam. Great experience both ways flight was on time , great service on board, leg space even on economy was ample enough to stretch, good food <br><br>Cons- The returning sector Hanoi to HK even if you are checked in and no checking luggage cannot print boarding pass need to collect from Hanoi airport but the service at this point is so very slow. Had only 2 people in front of the queue but had to wait for 30 mins for my turn just to print boarding pass.  <br><br>No entertainment on board."
822,Gary H,5,"Because of the fantastic fares available, I decided to splurge on Business Class for this trip, and on an 11h 20 minute flight, what a great choice it turned out to be....even more so on the 13hr 30 back from Saigon.!!<br>The flight was operated by one of their  brand new (Sept 15) Boeing 787 Dreamliner's and the cabin was large, very spacious and with adjustable 'mood' lighting to suit the time of day / night,The seat was multi adjustable, to full lie flat, and included individual reading light, and with ample storage space and cubby holes for everything from laptop to phones to shoes. The overhead bins were huge.<br><br>The food was superb  and the service incredible, but not intrusive.<br>Fantastic and up to date  in flight entertainment system, presented on a 15 and half inch tv screen......and to top it all a full lie flat bed for a few hours kip, complete with comfortable blanket and pillow.<br>The Cabin crew were immaculately turned out and courteous throughout the long flight.<br>We would have left on time, but eventually departed  20 minutes late, being informed it was due to late arrival and loading of baggage . Time was made up, and we arrive 5 minutes ahead of schedule<br>Very affordable fares to Vietnam....and beyond. I plan on using them for Beijing later this year. Hanoi as a hub is good, and the fares exceptional across all cabin classes. Take a look, you might surprise yourself.<br>Highly recommended"
823,Temeny A,3,"Lovely people but I think every single flight was either late or cancelled. Our flight from DaNang to come back home was cancelled and the only reason we found out, other than from turning up at the airport, was due to a call from Buffalo Tours (car transfers). This meant the transfer time in Hanoi was minimal and we had to run to make the transfer."
823,AustraliaMazza,5,"I have just had my 3rd flight in 18 months Sydney to Paris  return with Vietnam Airlines. <br>The planes are new and seats very comfortable,  food is of a high standard. This is now my preferred carrier on international flights."
823,Joseph O,4,"I have opted for Vietnam Airlines on my trips to Vietnam since being recommended by my friend a few years back.<br><br>I have found the airlines have improved tremendously since I first took it a few years back. Although the service on economy could be improved, I find their service level more than satisfactory. The food is tasty and sufficient as I am not a big eater.<br><br>The seats in the economy are comfortable and with sufficient leg room. Their in-flight magazines are dual language (Vietnamese &amp; English).<br><br>My only complaint with Vietnam Airlines flight to any part of Vietnam from South East Asia is that the there is no entertainment console for each seat. There are main television screens which shows some movie or documentary, most often too small to view which is not worth the bother.<br><br>However, Vietnam Airlines do give very good rates if you can book your flight at least three (3) ahead. <br><br>I am converted to Vietnam Airlines every time I fly to Vietnam."
823,Jen C,5,"I had reservations about flying Vietnam airways because l for some silly reason thought they were a lower level of service airline, was l wrong l really can't fault them in any way food very nice and plentiful anything you needed you only had to ask, looking forward to my next flight with them, plane not as new or roomy as Emirates but also didn't cost anywhere near what they would have cost me, happy customer and the check in crew in Melbourne were just fab , really funny guys that just make the whole process painless"
823,troycav,5,"last minute we needed to fly as the trains weren't running.  on our go to travel booking sites we were getting quoted around the 200AUD one way. but 5 mins later we went to the travel agent in Hoi An to she said 60 bucks. i quickly went home and logged onto the Vietnam airline site. Lesson learned wait to book you domestic flight in Vietnam until you are there, appears to pick up your IP and give different prices.  <br><br>Great airline and we didn't even have to use a bus to get onto the plane,  that was a nice treat in the heat."
824,Russ K,4,"Heard some not very flattering things about this airline , but I found then on a par with the vast majority of European airlines . This flight from Ho Chi Min to Nha Trang only took 1 hr so no fancy service , just a bottle of water after takeoff . Cabin crew really nice , &amp; the planes , A320s are quite new . On leaving Vietnam for Thailand flight VN605 , same type of aircraft  A320 but this time as the flight was just over 2.hrs you got a snack with your water , so don't expect a hot meal . I found them good , would fly with them again in in the area , this airline is supposed to be notorious for canceled flights &amp; delays , only delay I met was a 10 min one while the finished cleaning ."
824,ciarawfr,2,"We chose Vietnam airlines mainly based on having a direct flight to Vietnam from Europe, it was also the best value although now having flown with them, I would definitely pay more to fly with an airline who actually value their customers. <br>From check-in to landing, the staff were poorly trained and didn't seem to care too much about offering any kind of decent customer service. The plane itself was fine although already starting to show wear and tear. Flight attendants were sparse and I was kept awake by passengers hitting their call buttons over and over again as Flight attendants simply didn't respond. We had ordered vegetarian meals and they managed to mix up breakfast with dinner and vice versa - when we pointed this out to them, the response was a shrug. Once we all settled in after the meal, there were no attendants monitoring the cabin or offering drinks during the flight as I've experienced with other airlines on long haul flights. They just simply didn't seem to care. On our return trip, I actually took a photo of a check-in staff member at the check-in desk in Hanoi as we stood late at night waiting to check-in (11:30pm flight). People with young children were left standing for quite a long time while waiting for check-in desks to open (we were told check in would open at 8pm) one hour later they decided to open after their nap!). Safety regulations were not particularly enforced on the plane for take off and landing - lots of passengers had their seats reclined, tables out! For me, it was very mediocre and I certainly would not fly with this company again for any long haul flight."
824,Maeve68,4,"We are a mature couple who love traveling and doing our own thing. I booked a flight from Siem Reap with Vietnam Airlines then read the reviews. I was a little concerned.<br>However our flights were very good. We did 3 flights with them and would recommend them. They sent a reminder emails and reminder web check-in etc. They confirmed every flight 5 days prior to departure. The planes were very clean, staff efficient and water and a refresher towel were given out. We only flew domestic. We had no problems with this airline and we would use them again."
824,David  S,4,Flew Vietnam Airlines return from Sydney to Hanoi including all domestic flights throughout Vietnam enjoyed upgrade to Business on 1 leg as well as premium economy on the large legs and was blown away by the service of all staff. Planes do look a little tired but no issues and all flights were on schedule - so no complaints here.
824,Optionalextras2,4,"We went on two flights with Vietnam airlines with the upgrade from Optiontown being successful, <br>The first from Hanoi to Danang was fine, it was pretty full even in business, Check in was fast especially for the business line up.  When it was time to board we went down steps and was directed either right or left. Right was for the pink bus with seats for business, the yellow economy for standing only.   We were seated, offered juice or water and newspaper choices.  There was an overhead screen showing Just for Laughs. Even on this short flight we had a meal which was really nice on proper china too.  Flight was on time and really nice with a comfy large seat too. <br>Second flight Danang to Ho Chi Minh,<br>Before we left home we were notified of a delay from 11.00-11.30, The day before the flight it was changed to 1.15pm then that morning 2.00pm, saying when we were at the airport it was due to a late arrival into HCMC but that was hours before so not sure it was true, We were the only ones in business (8 seats) with the same bus arrangement as before. We got the juice and papers, no screen but big seats and some lovely sandwiches offered. It was all good and overall we had great flights, just a shame about the delays but fortunately it didn't impact on us at all. Much better overall than expected for sure."
825,darkpeach,4,"Great Airline with great and friendly staff. The food and beverages were good, and the flight attendants friendly and supportive. The price for the tickets was great, and I would book anytime again Vietnam Airlines."
825,Geoff Y,4,Use VN airlines to Vietnam regularly as well as Europe. Business class not quite the same standard as Qantas but then also not as expensive. Very comfortable flying with great service.
825,kandb17,4,"Service just fine overall and while flight short upgraded very inexpensively to business class and enjoyed fast check in, the priority customs and security lines @ Hanoi International and air con lounge.  Jet older but bus class comfort just fine. Meal is based on the design of food services from the 80s but on the short flight who cares - no ones goes to Vietnam for the plane food!"
825,Carl C,4,"First time i flew with Vietnam Airlines to Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon from Sydney. I found the seats comfortable and noticed more leg room than normal. The onbard entertainment was good and the service was great we were fed twice on the flight and the food to chose from was very nice and also the drinks available was also good. The overall service from the crew staff was excellent. I would fly with them again rather than doing stop overs for the sake of saving money, straight flight and getting there without jet lag was a great feeling."
825,ulric2016,4,"I've flown with this carrier more than a twenty times during the past five years (that's a slight indication of how much I like flying with them).<br><br>From the initial check-in at Melbourne, right through to the exit at Siem Reap, the staff are friendly; courteous; helpful (including during the change of flight at Saigon (HCMC) airport).<br><br>I've also been fortunate on occasion to have been upgraded to business class.  This added to the delight when flying with V.A.  The service, food, comfort and seating are beyond compare.  The quality of comfort and service in business class is even better than that offered by Singapore Airlines (I've also travelled in business class on their airline).<br><br>Finally (and probably most importantly), the safety of this airline is incomparable.  I've never felt unsafe in their aircraft and I believe QANTAS engineers do the maintenance work on the aircraft."
826,Steve Ballard,5,"I've been flying with Vietnam Airlines for quite some time - back to the DC-6 times - and I've always found them to be safe and very efficient, but with the grace of their nation completely evident in their serenity. The crews are also very competent, and nothing is a problem for them to help with."
826,Hidayah AJ,4,"Took a total of 4 flights with Vietnam Airlines (because of layover). Flight attendants were service-oriented. Had experienced an old plane on our way back. Some of the inflight tv were malfunctioned. You could not pause the movie you were watching and when you changed the channel to watch another movie, you have to wait for the intended movie to end and it would restart again. SMH. The rest of the flight were new planes and it was good. We requested for Muslim meals during our trips and it was surprisingly very good and delicious. No delays. Check in flight at South Korea and Singapore were very friendly and they let us chose our seats as in we wanted it to be aisle or window."
826,Chris K,2,they ran out of food at our seat on the way and on the way home so they gave me a breakfast for dinner on the way home and biscuits for lunch on the way there. this was the most worst flight i have ever been on. the flight attendants were more interested on looking after the vietnamese on board.and some of the overhead lockers had the doors missing.then they served warm beer.just not on.
826,Miguel M,4,"I took 2 flights with vietnam airlines. Both of them domestic (Saigon-Hue and Danang-Hanoi). They always delay 20-30 minutes ALL their flights and thats why i dont give them 5 stars. More than that, the staff is really friendly and the pñanes were really new and confortable. It was a great flight with no problems"
826,Emily B,5,"I flew premium economy return in June and was mightily impressed with the service levels, the plane was new and immaculate, the staff very well presented and attentive. Legroom was ample and generally a really nice experience."
827,Jan5,4,"After extensive research we decided to book a Business Class ticket to London on Vietnam Airlines. None of our friends or associates had any experience with Vietnam Airlines, so we booked based on price. We were extremely pleased with our choice! The dream liner was very clean, and the service was impeccable! The beverages and meals were flavorful and we chose the Vietnamese cuisine. The movies and duty free shopping in flight were above average. This was great value for the price and I would highly recommend this path to London!"
827,oldbackpacker,3,"So, i splurged and flew Bus class as the the fare was excellent and they had the dreamline on half the route, so total flat beds.  If you are a stickler for service, forget this airlines but if your prepared to save some $$ and get a good night sleep... its fine.  The crew from Sydney to Saigon were perfect but plane was old and my seat was partly broken .<br>The  crew from Saigon to Frankfurt were pathetic . The english was very poor &amp; they were never seem after the meal service. I had to ask for drinking water 4 times in the flight as it was never offered, The toilets were tiny &amp; like Economy &amp; no toiletries. Wifi was not allowed even though the airline boast it is available on website and inflight magazine . Very few movie/TV options, so take a book. These little things add up &amp; really let this airline down. I would fly them again as the fare &amp; aircraft is so good, but be warned this is not the business class service you get with MAS/Singapore or Qantas."
827,tony12cu,5,"This is always an airline I will consider and search for when flying in SEA or Indochina.  It offers great value by giving great food.<br><br>Although we lose some of ground service, seating, onboard entertainment and legroom, it is still a great flight in waiting."
827,Michelle C,2,I chose Vietnam Airlines as the reviews were quite pleasing. However my experience was nothing in comparison. I requested vegetarian meals when booking but was told we needed to reconfirmed this 24 hours before the flights and had to eat bread rolls. The staff were extremely rude though to appease myself I put this down to cultural behaviour. The inflight entertainment did not work and the seating was at best disorganised in that we requested an aisle but this was denied only to have an obese man sitting in the aisle seat with no chance of getting past but directly behind me a slim lady occupying only one seat in three. I won't travel this airline in future and can only relay my concerns for future consumers.
827,AA1115,4,Did a trip to North VIetnam with family. Was a bit sceptical on flying Vietnam airlines. However overall the staff was courteous and kid friendly.Food was also good . Kids lapped it up. Overall satisfied and shall be open to travel again.
828,morningcoffeehunter,3,Our family of five took Vietnam Airlines for the internal flight from Hanoi to Hoi An.<br>This is the national airline and was great value. ................................................<br>The flight is a standard economy with no frills . No drink service or anything. .......<br>Just over an hour . ...<br>So it's more like a transfer. <br>No issues ...
828,Danielle T,4,"We recently flew with this airline from Sydney to London then Paris to Sydney , we flew business class and it was great value for money .. although the flights to and from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh city were an older plane (777) with fluctuating air conditioning . The flights to and from London and Paris had a newer plane (787 &amp; A350) , they were so much better with great flatbed seats and they were quieter with  better air quality .The staff were always very friendly and helpful , the food was very nice with good choices , will definitely fly with them again ."
828,YukiAnh,4,"Although Vietnam airlines is the best in Vietnam, the hostess seldom to smile with us. I feel they work as a robot."
828,mrandmrsmorris,2,"When checking in at airport I noticed that our seats were rows apart even though I had politely asked to sit together. The Vietnamese lady at London check in lied to me when I challenged this, adament we were seated together. TV was appalling, food ok. Endured 6 hour delay due to aircraft fault."
828,AlecsAle,4,"We had a domestic flight in Vietnam, from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang ( short flight ). Crew was nice and helpful. <br>Very good value for money, so if I have the chance i will fly again with Vietnam Airlines."
829,Grangeon p,4,"Very good price ( for exemple...Danang..Hanoi 1 h fly... Only 45 $ us!!!<br>Simple Food ,nice Welcome and good team...<br>Un bon moyen pour se déplacer d'as le Vietnam..."
829,Lori T,4,I was pretty nervous traveling this airline after reading some not so great reviews online but the flight was fine.  We flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh return and also two domestic flights within Vietnam.  Staff were good and there was plenty of food which was ok.  My only complaint was that on the way to Ho Chi Minh the entertainment (movies/tvs) did not work.  But on the way back the entertainment was good with enough choices and current movies.
829,Stewart W,5,"Flew with Vietnam Airlines for the first time and would certainly fly with them again. Found the service was very good and the food was also very good with a good selection to choose from.<br>For $4,300 return for business class was very good value."
829,Irene S,5,"The check-in was fast and smooth, the captain was informative, we arrived ahead of schedule, and overall the flight was great!"
829,Dick J,5,"superior service nice and good looking staff, food and drinks excellent, slept for 7 hours in businessclass. ounge in Hanoi is not bad, but doesn't meet European class."
830,Holias,4,"We flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh and return.  We also booked 3 internal flights within Vietnam for our group of six passengers.<br><br>The flights were great,  nice and smooth.  Most flights left on time. one left late but arrived on time. The  actual flights itself were good. <br><br>The major disappointment was the price. I booked this flight in April and paid straight away. A few months later I noticed the price had dropped considerably, I approached the airline to see what they could do for us, upgrade, refund etc. I do not think I was being unreasonable but I was advised they would do nothing about this.  I understand if this was a budget airline, but we are talking a full service 4 star plus airline.  I was soooooo disappointed and feel somewhat ripped off as a result of their lack of ""service"" before the trip had even started.   <br><br>My 3 star rating for Customer care refers solely to our pre flight experience, not the service received on the flight or at check in."
830,Merryn Y,4,Food was terrible.<br>Flight was only half full so was able to have a full row of seats to myself gor the duration of the flight.<br>Connecting flight to Hanoi was delayed by almost 4 hours - not impressed.
830,Brian W,2,"Hi <br>I recently traveled to Vietnam with you Airline. <br><br>To Ho Chi Min on from Sydney 17/9/2016. <br>    This flight was not good. I had no entertainment system. I asked the Steward to help but he had no success after 2 tries to ""reset"" it. He seemed very confused and frustrated with the system. This System is completely outdated. The food was of very poor quality.<br><br>To Sydney  from Ho Chi Min on 3/10/2016.<br>   This flight was even worse than the one going to Vietnam. The air conditioning was very bad. Fluctuating between 18 c to 30 c every 30 minutes. The air was also very thin. The reading lights were terrible. If I turned mine on it would turn on the next row so nobody was able to use the lights.<br>The food was disgusting. Most people could not even take more than one mouthful.  <br>On arrival the front door of the Plane could not be opened which meant a 45 minute delay in disembarking.<br><br>I know this airline flies direct which is a great advantage but I think I will use a better class next time."
830,Rettiepo,5,The flights were on time and the service was great plenty to eat and drinks comfortable seats and planes were clean and new looking! I love that it was a direct flight from Melbourne to Vietnam
830,scgscg,3,"There were no dramas on this flight. <br><br>Planes are old and need an upgrade, movies are very old. <br><br>Female staff seemed very helpful, but male staff were very rude and unhelpful."
831,Mlnovo,1,"While the on flight staff was lovely and friendly, Vietnam Airlines, through their actions, made clear to us that they do not want or understand travelling families.  First, if you have a baby, they only allow the infant to have 10 kilos of luggage.  Anyone who has an infant knows, that your child has more luggage and gear than you do.  They will charge you an outrageous amount for overage.  Further, not only did they lose our gate checked stroller but they broke it.  They refused to pay for it and have not delivered it to our hotel 4 days after our flight.  I am a frequent traveler who understands that mistakes happen; however, the airlines has never once apologized and often times have just been rude.  I have been shocked by the lack of service or desire to help a family."
831,Thanks4Zero,4,"Our only issue was the flight was quite late.<br><br>They must have canceled two flights and replaced them with a single at the last minute.<br><br>Pushed into a 777 for the short trip to Da Nang, plane was no where near full, so we were all fairly relaxed and happy.<br><br>It was peak time, as it seemed everyone was headed for the Hoi An's lantern festival full moon, by my best guess. Problem was arriving at 5pm, when we should have arrived at 3.30pm, makes for a rush, luckily it's an internal flight, and the Vietnamese are really nice and accommodating.<br><br>Plane was roomy, and comfortable, staff were nice/friendly and helpful.<br>Check in, drop and pick-up of baggage was no trouble at all.<br><br>Well worth the price, and most enjoyable trip."
831,Petalpopsicle,3,"We flew to Vietnam economy, and did three internal flights as well - all quite satisfactory. For the overnight flight back to Sydney, we thought we'd be kind to our middle aged bodies and pay $400 each extra for premium economy. What a colossal waste of money. The only evident benefit was a priority baggage tag. We were in bulk head seats in the cabin right behind business class, so lots of leg room and quick exit. BUT - old economy class seat, about 20cm recline, no footrest, economy amenities, food and beverages. So, very expensive bulkhead seats and priority tags. Don't do it."
831,kenjones29,5,"One of the better Airlines I have flown with, the service was very good and the room in the economy seats was good and the seats very comfortable.   The food on all the fights I had with Vietnam Airlines was very good and better still, all the drinks were free.  I flew from London to Ho Chi Minh, stayed there for a few days, then flew to Seam Reap in Cambodia for a few days, then flew to Danang and stayed in Hoi An for a few days, then onto Hanoi then to Bangkok and then back to Hanoi and then to London.  All flights were with Vietnam Airlines and I was well pleased"
831,Caitlin M,3,"I know they do some cheap flights but I paid fairly hefty prices for an international return from Aus and two domestic flights within Vietnam. <br>The planes used on the international flights were pretty old and had pretty poor leg room etc. There was one lovely one for one of the domestic flights but the in-flight entertainment wasn't working. <br>All 4 flights did not leave on time and landed late. The boarding was always chaotic. <br>The customer service was generally okay (though not particularly friendly), except for the staff who giggled when he pointed out I would need to look at the screen of the person sitting next to me if I wanted to watch anything for the 9 hour flight.<br>I would probably avoid flying with them again."
832,Granny-Mae,5,"This is the 5th leg we have flown to/from Europe with Vietnam Airlines Business. Due to health and height we looked for the best value business flights and having found Vietnam Airlines we will continue to fly with them as the value has remained over the past 3 years. Of course the destination has to fit obviously. Sydney to HCM City (daytime flight) is an older plane but comfortable large recliner chairs. The leg to Paris/London/Frankfurt was an A350 with flat bed pods (the night flight). Service, food and drinks could not be faulted. The lounge in Sydney is the new Sky Team lounge - large - good choice of food and drinks and lots of room. The lounge in HCM City was relocated this time being larger, more comfortable and a wider range of food (which is appreciated when you have 6 hours to kill)."
832,trustmejohn,4,A reasonably efficient no frills flight. It was a well managed event that doesn't reflect the cheapness of the flight. I understand this airline is growing at quite an incredible rate due in part to the Vietnamese economy lifting but also offering good service at a good price. I only speak English but had no difficulty.
832,Matthew S,4,"Kaohsiung is a great airport and the check in service was very good, security and immigration helpful and simple. We boarded and all continued and was good, a meal was served and this was good!"
832,lloydh689,3,"1st leg of trip to the UK, found seats a bit cramped but service was good getting two meals when we expected only one and drinks were included. Entertainment was acceptable for a long flight but my wife's video screen didn't work for most of the trip"
832,Paulinmorpeth,1,"This flight was from Da Nang to Hanoi and it was a very poor experience, probably my worst flight in over forty years of flying.<br><br>On boarding the flight we were met by a cabin full of condensation which was coming from the air-conditioning vents. Apparently this is not unusual as I’m told it was to humidify the cabin, however when you can’t see three rows in front it becomes a bit disconcerting.<br><br>Unfortunately we were held on the runway for an hour due to weather conditions which resulted in a thunderstorm with heavy rain. I was okay with that but the crew announcements were very difficult to hear due to the barely audible P.A.  system and the crew’s poor command of English. However I doubt that whatever system was in place many of the passengers would have taken any notice. Most people ignored the “fasten seat belt” sign and wandered around the aircraft, using the toilet and making mobile phone calls after being told not to do so. There was a child about three years old in front of us who kept climbing on the seats and was completely unsecured during the whole flight. Grandmother who was with him was oblivious to any possible risk and none of the crew raised this with her. <br><br>Just ahead of take off a passenger near me continued to use his phone and had I not told him to turn it off, I suspect he would have used it in flight.<br><br>We hit major turbulence just after take-off and the plane lost altitude but again the staff did not advise passengers to remain seated and to keep their seat belts on. Needless to say the child in front was still unsecured.<br><br>On approach to Hanoi, the ignoring of the crew continued with people keeping their seats in the reclined position, tables down and the usual suspects walking about the cabin on approach. The woman in front completely ignored the crew when asked to return her seat to the upright position. It was only when my wife called the crew and insisted she was made to do so did it happen. <br><br>If Vietnam Airlines wants to compete with other world class carriers then it needs to get cabin safety sorted. Staff need to be assertive with passengers and make it clear what is expected otherwise a serious accident in the cabin is likely to result."
833,Vicky2472,4,This was my first flight with vietnam airlines &amp; I would highly recommend them. Comfortable seats with good spacing &amp; media package. The food was excellent. The service was okay - staff a little reluctant to serve but not a significant issue.
833,ShahidAgha,5,Booked a flight from Melbourne to Tokyo going through Ho Chi Minh city.  Free meal at Ho Chi Minh airport lounge.  The travel agent made a mistake as we had special meal required but were unable to get.  Frequent drinks and food was OK. <br>The best thing was smooth flight.
833,cherylpenny,4,"Exceptional service throughout. British Airways could learn a thing or two from Vietnam Airlines. The reason why haven't given a 100% rating is because although the choice of inflight entertainment was excellent, the sound failed on the outward and inward flight."
833,Shane C,4,"Flew Sydney-Saigon-Hanoi-DaNang-Saigon-Sydney.  All flights were comfortable, meals were pleasantly surprisingly quite nice.  Internal flights only get a bottle of water.  As many have said, once the meal is served the hosties just disappear.<br>I'm a tall and large man, there was plenty of leg room and width on the seat.  Internal flight on A321 has more room than the 777.<br>Check in at all locations was easy, staff pleasant.<br>I would fly with them again."
833,Queenslanderabroad,2,"The flights that we booked with you were changed, with the first leg from Sydney putting us onto a changed flight. I have no idea if they tried to communicate this with us or you at all; we were just lucky that we were early to be available for the earlier flight and not be rushed through when we were trying to do a small amount of duty-free shopping. We had no emails about the change and we didn’t have any missed calls either.<br><br>The flight itself was very basic, and in comparison to Cathy Pacific over 5 years ago, Vietnam Airlines have lots of room to improve to match this competitor. The seats were essentially fine, but the entertainment options are very out dated. With movies playing at set times, rather than starting and pausing at our own convenience. Our seat had a faulty headphone jack, so even with trying other headphones, the sound was scratchy and muffled. In asking for help from a steward, we were ignored for 30 minutes - we would have been better off making a scene and demanding a new seat, but we tried to be polite and patient. Our seats were on the right hand side, with an obvious bias by the staff to give more service to the left side passengers - I know this may be by accident, but the people on the left had more staff available and prompt service of food and assistance, with the right side being made to wait extended times with 1 steward looking most inconvenienced by having to do anything.<br>I noticed a few fittings that were damaged, and bolts that had rattled loose that were meant to hold safety gear in place. These things shouldn’t be noticed by someone like me who has no training in maintenance or engines.<br><br>Of the 4 planes we boarded, it seems that the fleet is quite old and needs some upgrades, if not new planes to showcase their desired standard.<br><br>The time in transferring from international to domestic terminals was also hap-hazard. There were strange delays, poor communication, and having us wait in crowded steamy buses on the tarmac for extended periods for reasons we couldn’t fathom. There was poor coordination with these buses getting to the plane, with the drivers not knowing what ATC or the ground-staff wanted, and we were just emptied onto a tarmac to fight our way up the stairs. It would be so easy to do this in stages, or to have the forward seats enter the front door and rear seats enter from the rear. The baggage handling was poor at best, with massive delays that even the flight staff were surprised and annoyed by.<br><br>For the return flights, the foot rest was broken, so we couldn’t extend our legs. This lead to cramps and swollen feet, and not being able to sleep at all on the flight. My pocket on the seat in front of me was completely torn, so all the contents were dropped on me and I had nowhere for the any belongings that I wanted mid-flight (except from the locker overhead).<br><br>The food was okay, but I’ve had better airline food, but the lack of service to get water was a real problem. The service buttons seemed to be broken, or just ignored. <br><br>As much as we enjoyed our time in Vietnam, if we are generally left with Vietnam Airlines to travel with, we’d be hard-pressed to actually return to Vietnam. We’d have more comfort at the same price to go to Malaysia or Thailand. So Vietnam’s national airline is then the reason that we aren’t spending our money in their country. We are already talking about going back to Vietnam in 2 years, but it would not be with an airline that resembles what we just experienced.<br><br>Trying to consider social, economic, cultural and logistic factors, I’d give Vietnam Airlines 2.5 / 5, with the absurd joke of Ryanair getting 1.5/ 5 by my standard; this should show that Vietnam has some serious improvement to manage or the better carriers will just overtake them and make them obsolete."
834,DCoro,4,"Flying the Vietnam Airlines A350 will be a totally different experience than flying the 777 on its fleet, this plane is a lot more comfortable and features like the entertainment system are a lot better. Check-in and boarding at Hanoi is very chaotic, so you really need to get to the airport at least 3 hours before your flight, our hotel told us that 2 hours would be enough but check-in was very messy and chaotic, so try to be at the airport in time. Service onboard is excellent and food is decent. Vietnam Airlines checked baggage allowance on economy class is just one 20kg bag, so be aware of that"
834,mopi2016,3,I was a little bit dissapointed by this flight be cause The crew members gave more attentiôn to thé Vietnamese people than the other passengers . Food was' t bad but it was a long flight and except the meals there wasn.t much to eat.
834,DCoro,3,"First, consider this review just about the 777 Vietnam Airlines has on its fleet, this plane look a lot more older than it really is, both outside and inside, maybe because they are buying new types (787/A350) they decided to not invest anymore on the cosmetic appearance of the 777, so your experience would depend a lot on the type you're flying. Check-in experience at Incheon Airport is really good, totally different than the way back from Hanoi, where check-in is very chaotic, service onboard is great, always smiling faces and people wanting to help you, food is decent and the entertainment system on this plane is outdated"
834,Jackson L,3,"This airline offers really cheap rates for travels to other countries. For its price, its economy status really stands out. The food on the airline is decent, where nothing is too fancy. The usual main course with fruits and dessert is a standard in this plane. The service is generally ok, with basic needs being met.<br><br>The plane can be quite old but it should still fly well."
834,salisa L,2,"We booked return flight from Bangkok- Ho Chi Min and then Ho Chi Minh - Sydney and same for the return flight. The flight there was ok average i would say. Food is alright, check in line were long but fast, staffs English speaking skill is very poor, We ask if they have any other menu apart from Pork and we had to talked to 3 staffs before they could understand us. In-flight entertainment is very limited. However on our flight back from Sydney -Ho Chi Minh was different. The check in line was long and very very slow, but the lady who checked us in was helpful and assign both of us aisle seat since the flight is not full. Food was alright but portion is kind a small for my husband so after we finished our food and he wasnt full (everyone already got their food and almost done with it) we asked if we can get more hot food or may be salad. The flight attendance just simply said ""NO, finished"" even though we could still see plenty of food on her trolley. I tried to look at her name tag so we can make a complain to the airline but ""Nguyen"" is the most common name in Vietnam..."
835,Alexandra D,4,"We had a nice flight although tiring , the food was delicious and the staff always willing to provide you with whatever you required even outside of normal service times !"
835,ZoogieBAR,5,"For me, catching a flight is a necessity to get from A to B so I don't normally care too much about which airline I fly with.  This time however the long haul flight was a pleasant experience, as good as it can be. The staff were extremely friendly, the food and drinks were fine and the inflight entertainment was good. The Business Class tickets were even less expensive than other airline Premium Economy tickets so Vietnam Airlines is certainly worth checking out for your next trip."
835,Diane V,3,"We travelled to and from Vietnam on this airline and all i can say is you get what you pay for. We started by being delayed twice, so if you have connecting flights as we did, make sure you have plenty of time. We only just made our flight. The service was ok, although we only saw flight attendanta at meal times. The food choice was non existent at the back of plane,as they had run out. The seats were uncomfortable although maybe thats the case on all flights, but i noticed it more this time. On the plus side we did arrive safely and provided you don't have high expectations it is worth flying Vietnam. The money saved meant more spending money in Vietnam."
835,Ed123455789,2,"Due to depart at midnight. Around 11.15pm announced a delay to 8am the next day due to technical problems!<br>Managed to switch to London flight, but had to get back from there at own expense"
835,Hollis S,5,"The flight was just fine.  There was a transfer stop over in Taiwan but it was no problem.  Both airplanes were clean, well kept up and the food was good.  Enough staff to keep things moving and yet not be a bother to passengers."
836,Peter P,1,"My holiday was amazing, and would have been even better had the airline not left a bitter taste in the mouth. <br>We had booked a flight to and from Hanoi, the first flight was direct, and we later found that our return journey had one stop - Ho Chi Minh City, a place we intended on going anyway, so we asked the airline if it was possible to check in at HCMC instead, and it was going to cost £300 extra per person. Zero flexibility on our ticket, even though it would have had no inconvenience on the airline. <br>So we booked a flight to Ha Noi, and when we got there found that they cancelled our flight to HCMC, missing our connection to London. They had sent an email to me two hours earlier, whilst I was flying.<br>We lost a day and got back to London exhausted."
836,Trang Đ,5,This is a first time I've been in a plane. I was so scared of this problem but I had a wonderful trip. The flight was smooth. The staffs were so friendly and helpful.
836,Bill D,5,This was the first time ever we have upgraded to premium economy but it was definitely worth the extra particularly on a night time flight. I think having read some other reviews we may have been lucky being on a brand new Dreamliner but it really was a very comfortable flight with plenty of legroom and the inflight entertainment was also very good indeed. The food was also good and the cabin crew were very attentive. Cleanliness of the toilets was good but not as good as other carriers I have used but I have seen a lot worse! Beware at check in that if two people are travelling in different names (my wife's passport is still in her maiden name) you may not end up sitting together as they seem to have a strange booking system. If you stand your ground and insist something usually happens to correct the issue despite the protest from the check-in staff that it cannot be changed...it can!
836,Doris M,4,Booked premium economy seats for this lengthy flight and it was worth every penny.  Lots of leg room and the seats were extremely comfortable.  Entertainment is limited but sufficient given most people slept.  Food and beverages were good but more variety would have been appreciated.
836,Jon L,2,"AIR VIETNAM<br>Flight VN300 Saigon to Narita 13/9/2016<br>Booked a window seat specifically but on arriving at the allocated seat we found ‘no’ window.  Yes, no window – it was blank!  However to the staffs’ credit on asking we were transferred to another row with a window so all was well but the question remains as to why we were allocated a totally inappropriate seat. Adding on to this level of dysfunction was the fact that one of our screens didn’t work as didn’t several other screens in the immediate area.  How can this lack of maintenance happen and what does it tell you about airworthiness?<br>Flight VN257 Hanoi to Ho Chi Min 24/9/2016<br>No wine, beer, tea, coffee or indeed even headphones plus the worst sandwich I have ever part eaten on a plane.  On the reverse trip from Saigon to Hanoi we received all of the above so therefore it is this flight which failed to offer expected and standard services.  As this is less than standard we suggest that you check what is supposed to be served on each leg.  Service is a critical part of flying and staff curtailing this service so they can sit down for most of the flight is not on.<br>Flight VN781  Saigon to Melbourne 24/9/2016<br>More problems.  This was an 8 hour flight which meant we were captive for the duration depending on Vietnam Air for entertainment, comfort and sustenance.  My knees were hard against the seat in front which was tighter than our other two flights with the same airline.  This made it difficult to move and most certainly difficult to try and sleep.  As well and once again, one of our screens had a vision fault.  But, the worst part of this flight was the food.  Fish for supper was undercooked, mushy and thoroughly awful and the entire breakfast was inedible with the exception of the yogurt.  I have pictures.<br>Go elsewhere.  It’s a pity because the staff were great and most hospitable. Our problems were management based around maintenance, food and misrepresented expectations.  Dysfunctions on one flight may have been a one off but three in a row says Vietnam air need help with a few aspects. <br>US<br>We are professionals in the hospitality industry currently owning and working at Mon Ami restaurant in Melbourne and having reviewed / travelled / consulted / eaten / owned businesses all over the world for literally decades through Langhill.net.

837,ACCHellingly,5,"Very comfortable airline. Flew from UK and also used for internal flights. Good service, good food, good entertainment and good value. Kept family of five (including teenagers) very happy and would certainly use again."
837,Elgumati,5,"Comfortable flight, polite staff, good food.<br><br>Only thing I would say is the choice of entertainment was not very good."
837,Foodie480B,3,First time we used this airline and we have no complaints. We flew this airline to Hanoi then on to Hong Kong. Was easy checking in and got us to our destination on time. Food was OK and they served wine too. Coming back from Hong Kong via Ho Chi Minh city  our plane was diverted to a nearby airport because of the flooding in HCM and no flights were allowed to land. They managed to get us to our destination safe and sound. Kudos to the crew.
837,Peter W,4,My first flight on Vietnam Airlines. Great experience. Modern aircraft. Good on-board service. No complaints. Will book Vietnam Airlines again for my next return flight from Sydney to Frankfurt.
837,bevrobt,5,"Excellent service ,good quality food ,pleasant hostesses on the economy flight,we travelled back to Melbourne business class and that was a great experience ,the comfort,food and staff,would make us travel like that again."
838,davidP3350TQ,5,"Flew from Heathrow to Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh city + return,departed and arrived on time.<br>Cabin crew were great, food fine,drinks as required.There's quite a few movies but to me only one appealed the rest were rubbish. Being 6ft tall i found the lay flat bed would be better if one of my legs was 6 inches shorter than the other but thats probably down to Boeing designers not the airline.The transfers were fine and the flights to Siem Rep were in Airbus 320 which also departed and arrived on time..<br>Very competitive price, all in all very good."
838,George E,4,"The check in was very easy, the young lady that checked us in was very pleasant, considering how many people they check in the good attitude was most appreciated. On the plane, the food, entertainment and seat was consistent with what you would expect when paying economy price. The cabin staff are a credit to the airline, top quality."
838,Angela S,2,"Would never fly with Vietnam Airlines again.Food was terrible,in flight entertainment terrible and staff very unapproachable."
838,lan_n_vn,4,"Though my flight was delayed around 40 minutes because they needed to take some technical equipment to Da Nang. But it was the first time I had this experience since I has used VN Airlines for almost of my trips (both domestic and outbound).<br>It would be much better if VN Airlines's staff informed to their guests any information in advance, the guests would not be surprised and asked themselves that what was happened.<br>However, VN Air is still better than other cheaper Air-plane, I think."
838,Xiaorui L,5,The meals were prepared even for a 2 hours flight. The seats were comfortable and the food was quite delicious!
839,maureendodd,4,"This is the second time we have travelled with Vietnam Airlines ,on both occasions staff were very attentive , meals acceptable and trip trouble free. We would be more than happy to fly with them again."
839,tonyptty,5,"Although this was a domestic flight, it had all the comforts of an international flight, lots of leg room, comfortable seats, and first class staff attention. I would fly with them again wherever they fly the route which I require."
839,slwityk,4,"Took off on time.  Given drinks to start the flight.  Meal service was good and meal enjoyable.  Did find the cabin crew a bit slack.  Was asked if wanted more coffee and said yes, never came.  Would fly with them again."
839,Kerry C,4,"We had quite a relaxing flight because the plane was not full and we had a seat vacant in between us. Economy flight had three lots of three seats across. When booking in at Sydney had a nice conversation with the young girl there. We then asked if the flight was full which she answered no and we then asked for a vacant seat in between us. She was very nice and accommodated us. Food is typical airlines food, very basic."
839,MONIPE17,5,"Online checkin an easy way to get ahead of the crowds making it quicker.  Don't stand back when waiting in line to get your boarding pass or you will be pushed out, stand right behind next in line. Spacious seats, good staff and great pilots...enjoy."
840,annyle1201,4,"A good flight. Service quality is very good, staffs is fun and friendly. The plane is big and comfortable."
840,MONIPE17,5,"Online checkin a great help especially using the airlines app.  Comfortable seats, short trip and great staff with excellent pilots."
840,Beninn H,5,"very good airline .slept most of way back .seets folded back like a bed .was woken 4 breakfast , a very good on at that very friendly hostes. i would fly with them again for sure...benny barooga .aus"
840,Robyn D,5,"We travelled from Melbourne to Cambodia then onto Vietnam using Vietnam airlines and we had no troubles at all. The planes were always on time and the staff very friendly, they went out of their way to be very helpful. Would fly with them again😀😀"
840,Wayne T,2,"Upon boarding, I was given menu for evening meal- choice of 2 entrees, 4 mains and 4 desserts/cheese. When flight attendant came to take my order I was told there was only one entrée and 2 mains left that I could choose from. I might add that my preferred entrée and mains were the ones not available. Attendant came around with plate containing desserts/cheese but there was only 2 choices remaining. For breakfast a similar thing happened where an item of my choice off the menu was not available. On my next flight leg between Hanoi and Melbourne a similar thing happened. This was my first experience flying business class. I was able to stretch out and sleep and my flight from Melbourne to London, via Vietnam on outward journey was excellent."
841,Tiki S,4,"We got a good promotion price flight from BKK,Thailand to Narita,Japan. Services are good and food was okey."
841,whatdoesthismean,4,"I flew from Melbourne to London and everything in flight was good, EXCEPT on transiting from HCMC to Hanoi to connect with the London leg I got caught! - A VISA FOR VIETNAM IS REQUIRED. Even though you are not stopping in Vietnam, you have to change terminals to transit, and unlike most countries, they have no provision for normal transit facilities and you must go out and then back in through immigration! - a real pain, requiring a visa!!<br>I learnt about this hiccup after standing in the check-in queue at Melbourne airport for about an hour (as you do - the flight was full!), so by the time I reached the counter I found all this out and the only way they would let me on the flight was to purchase an expensive $340 visa which I could have bought myself for $40!! (if I'd had some time - which by then I didn't - the plane was boarding!). <br>Just one of the many rackets that are allowed to exist in Vietnam - they are not yet a tourist -oriented country like Thailand (they see tourists purely as a good source of $$) and I knew from prior trips there that uncontrolled rip-offs are everywhere, but they really got me on this one and it hurt!<br>I felt the airline should have given a warning when issuing the tickets (which they didn't) but I notice they now have it highlighted on their website. SO TRAVELLERS BEWARE!!!<br>I must say the leg from Hanoi through to Heathrow was fantastic - in a brand new 787 Dreamliner only half full, so that helped ease the earlier pain!<br>However the legs from/to Melb/HCMC are always chockas - the locals use the airline as cheap transport for their BOXES AND BOXES of commercial goods! It's like flying in a Fedex freight plane there is so much baggage! (because they allow 30Kg per person!)<br>Everything else about the airline is good, considering the flight costs are reasonable."
841,Pham N,5,New type of aircraft.Comfortable seat.Very good in flight service.Proffecient cabin crew and very nice food
841,Gally99691,4,"Good flight in the flight CDG-HAN. This flight was an Air France opperated by Vietnam Airline. The services are very similar. The plane is very recent so quit confortable, Flight entertainement was good, i was satisfied by this flight"
841,John W,5,"Excellent food , great service, &amp; in flight entertainment. Highly recommend using this airline for travels to Vietnam from Australia. On all flights home from Ho Chi Minh though, have experienced always full seats."
842,acerockolla,5,"We turned up at the airport at 1hr30 before the listed flight time only to find it had been delayed by 3 hours. This would be a massive disaster as our connecting flight would leave well before we landed. I told a staff member this problem. She asked me what time our connection was? I told her, and, she quickly called another member of staff over. With a few short words  and a graceful smile she passed us to the other staff member, who then led us to another check in desk. Again with a graceful smile and a few words we were being checked onto a flight that was already in the process of boarding. Instead of leaving three hours late we ended leaving 1 hour early. And, as a side note on our flight from Ho Chi Min the week before, we were on a tight connection time and when we finally cleared customs got our luggage etc between flights and went to the domestic terminal. They put a sticker on me (stating priority passenger) and again quickly passed a us through a few sets of hands and had us checking in cutting very long lines (sorry) of people to ensure we (and a few other small groups from the same flight) all caught our connections. I have never experienced such calm, pleasant and courteous staff like this at any other airline."
842,will2804,5,"We booked these seats as the cost for business class was the same as economy with other airlines.  The seating was fantastic the service was excellent, the food was a little unusual.  I could not fault the flight at all."
842,slwityk,4,"Once again, very impressed with this airline.  Offered drinks when we were settled which was good, being a night flight needed to relax before settling in for the night. The food was really good but think the service needs to come up a bit.   They tend to give more service to locals than foreigners.  Once the bed was down had a good sleep for about 6 hours.  Didn't have breakfast but spouse did and enjoyed it.  Only thing he didn't like was when they asked if he would like more coffee and then never delivered it, but did to the Vietnamese man across from us."
842,MarcoSue21,2,"Probably the only time I will fly with this airline, I realise that there's limited room on most airlines but this one virtually didn't have much. The reason why we flew with then was the price but I would spend the extra to be a bit more comfortable. The service was good and the food wasn't bad."
842,Brad S,4,"Just returned from flying Sydney - Ho Chi Minh City, HCMH to Hanoi, Hanoi to HCMH to Sydney.<br><br>Airlines seems to get a bit of a bad wrap so thought I would add my experience. Vietnam airlines is the only airlines I could fly direct to Vietnam from Sydney, flight times were good and price also. <br><br>No problems at all. Flights right in time, meals good and crew did their job feeding and attending to all. Was offered drinks multiple time including bottled water. No issues with bags. They offer a huge 50 kg allowance, which we did not even go close to getting near. Flee with Vietnam airlines 10 years ago and had same experience.<br><br>In and out of Sydney the planes are old Boeing 777 which are being replaced by Boeing Dreamliner by end of this year, 2016. Planes a bit tired but fine. Flee in a Dreamliner between HCMC and Hanoi. Very nice aircraft. Be excellent when you can do flight between n Australia and Vietnam in the Dreamliner."
843,Matindee,4,"Due to great prices my family and I flew all over Vietnam and Cambodia in business class which was worth every penny. Great staff, comfortable seats"
843,slwityk,3,"Decided to upgrade to business on line for our return leg to HCMC.  No problem at airport got through easily enough but when we got to the business lounge was told we couldn't get in.  Apparently you get in only if you have bought a business class ticket in the first place.  Wasn't impressed, think it's the only airline we know of that does this.  Flight was OK.  Good leg room did get a meal, sandwiches (which you don't in economy) and were offered hot beer, tea, coffee or soft drinks.  NO wine.  Only good thing about it was bags off really fast."
843,Rubes J,4,"Dreamliner aircraft was nice, not too cramped, food and service good. Long flight so welcomed the entertainment which could have been a bit better, more upto date. Must walk around regularly could really feel the pressure in legs for the first time, but might be me age!"
843,Kimly D,4,"Seats are really comfortable, really nice comfy big planes. The do serve food! Not a ton of entertainment, but it's a two hour flight. It's a little bit frustrating if you get the lowest class ticket, you can't move your departure time around at all, earlier with space or otherwise.<br><br>Also every flight we took (we used vietnam airlines 4x) they were all about 30 minutes late, but no late nice."
843,SHADIADNAN,3,"Vietnam Airlines is recognized for its safe flights and quality service, but it was not really the case when it comes to service. Upon check in Sophie was asked how much currency she is carrying on her. Flight meal (beef stew and mayonnaise diced potatoes) was not of a good quality; the plane was too old, seats were tired and monitors of old style hanging from above your head."
844,ashmandelhi,4,"I preferred  this airline over Laos airlines for flying to Luang Prabang from Siem Reap and back due to its competitive prices, better aircracft type (Airbus 320) and ease of booking over the net.Prices for the same journey was far less than offered by Laos airine with whom they have an code sharing arrangement or the aternative of taking hopping flights by smaller aircraft and longer time by Lao airlines.<br>Last year I had taken several flights of VA from siem reap to Ho Chi Minh,Da Nang, Hanoi and back and liked their on time assured performance."
844,slwityk,4,"First time flying business with this airline and was good.  Service, food, drinks all top notch.  Take off and landing excellent.  Bit different though with the flight from HCMC to Hue, take off good - landing not so, seemed to land on the left hand wheels and then jolt down on the right ones.  No service on this short flight except for water.  Definitely recommend International flights."
844,Michelle G,4,"Vietnam Air is safe and very professional, meals and drinks were very nice and I would recommend this airline to anyone travelling in or around Asia.<br>We enjoyed al places visited and the people of Vietnam are very welcoming.<br>Try it you will enjoy the beautiful sights of Halong Bay and Ho Chi Minh City. Tack on a quick trip to Cambodia and visit Siem Reap."
844,Ajay K,4,"The fight is nice, check in and boarding staff is good but the staff inside the plane is not at all interested in the passenger in domestic sector. My experience is based on 2 domestic flight recently. As no water or food will be served not the head phones will be provided during the flight. However flight is comfortable and seats are nice and comfortable and 20 kg baggage allowance is also included in the ticket price."
844,Robert L,5,"Our return journey was as good as the forward journey, both flights were on time, the food was beautifully presented &amp; tasty. The service was excellent, the aircraft spotless. We had a 14 hour layover in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam airlines organised visas, put us up in a hotel, provided all meals, also a 2hour tour of the city, all with transport. All free of charge, all of which was done curteously &amp; with a smile. The flight from Ho Chi Minh city was on a Boeing 777, the seats do not fully recline but, these aircraft are to be replaced with the Boeing 787 by the end of September which have fully reclining seats."
845,sydneyite1111,2,"In late August 16 I booked Premium Economy on VN773 for HCMC to Sydney as I had been advised to return to Australia for medical reasons and I wanted a some more room and comfort.    I was expecting what I had previously had with other airlines in premium economy  - that is a bigger fully adjustable seat with  plenty of room.   <br><br>I was disappointed to find that on the flight the seats seemed to me to be the same as economy – that is 3/4/3 across – I could see no obvious difference between where I was sitting and economy class despite the price difference.  The food and the service provided was adequate, but again no obvious difference from economy.   The entertainment system was very basic.<br><br>I understand that some of Vietnam Airlines aircraft have the new business class style seats in premium economy so it would pay to check closely before paying the extra for a class of seat that really does not exist on certain types of Vietnam Airlines aircraft."
845,les f,4,"The service from this airline was very good, not flown with them before and was surprised, from the check in to landing. The plane was an older type but still pretty good.<br>would use them again."
845,Doug P,2,Flying internationally they are average. Flying domestically it is different. Service is poor with an attitude like 'I am doing you a favor.' Frequently they reschedule without notice and you end up waiting an hour to an hour and a half late. No apologies and that is that.<br>Pride is what characterizes ground staff and cabin alike with few exceptions. <br>Fly with Viet Jet. They can be described as the exact opposite!
845,HoMinh,4,"Vietnam Airlines has the most flights connecting Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's business hub, and the capital Hanoi. Operating the largest fleet among three domestic carriers, the airlines also has more destinations covered in its network.<br>If you cannot take the first flight of the day, which is often on time, try to avoid those, for which you have to get through traffic during Ho Chi Minh City rush hourse for check-in as the road leading to the city's Tan Son Nhat airport faces regulars jams. Online check-in saves much time since the domestic terminal has been overloaded, until the government builds another airport and allows the domestic terminal to take-over the international one. Having completed online check-in, you can simply drop off your baggage at a separate counter and avoid the long line."
845,Hoàng Yen,4,"Good services, friendly nice staff. Chec k in procedures are good and flexible<br>I choose this airlines many times both domestic and abroad"
846,lmelb,3,"This flight was fine, no complaints. Check in, boarding &amp; in flight service was good but staff seemed very disinterested. Plane was very clean."
846,jaxandmoz,5,Excellent from start to finish food great entertainment we had  good choice of films games etc.. Lots of legroom left to sleep we got confused with our bags for next flight they sorted this in 5 minutes for us no delays pleasant staff on all flights would defiantly use again
846,Tah123123,2,"We booked our families trip of a lifetime, and we will certainly remember it for all the wrong reasons. On our shuttle from Manchester to Heathrow (BA) to connect with the Hanoi flight, I was put on standby. This was eventually sorted, but my luggage was not, left in Manchester, no info available for over a week finally reunited on 9th day of trip.  <br>On our return from Ho Chi Ming City, via Frankfurt the flight for my young daughter was deleted, potentially stranding us. Again eventually sorted, but by then we were allocated tickets strung across the plane.  I have written to complain, but nothing.  Pay you money take your chance.  Service on board was good."
846,bonehope,4,"Very efficient and friendly airline. Onboard service was also friendly and efficient, smooth flying and landing, hardly a bump!.  Not a great selection of movies but sufficient for less than 9 hour flight. Food was very tasty and good selection of beverages."
846,Neal_J_M,3,"Staff were welcoming and very smiley. Then it all stops, compared to all the other major airlines I have travelled with, they have to make some big improvements. In business class I am used to being given a choice of wines with dinner - not just 'red' or 'white', and if I would like an appetiser. Nothing offered, I had to ask.  Had a G&amp;T with one cube of ice. The white wine was warm (and still do not know what is was). Champagne was served in a wine glass and again not chilled enough. No after dinner drinks offered - I had to ask and it was like I was asking a special favour. Food was just about ok. Only offered ONE bottle of water - again had to ask for more. So in summary unless you have to fly direct to Hanoi avoid Vietnam Airlines, they have a lot to learn about service and quality. Seats/pods are not made for Westerners, I had to lie on my side and legs slightly bent. The return flight was even worse!"
847,mandy dougan,4,Big plane . Loads of empty seats . Flight was delayed on the way to da nang and they kept changing our flight times weeks before we were due to fly  . But they sent us emails to tell us . So you need to be able to check your emails while your away . Just in case they change them . <br> Inflight they gave you bottle of water and wet wipe . We were on a short flight both ways . Really big planes . Alot better than expected . Would fly with again .
847,GRACE,3,"my 1st time fly with this airline, first impressions was the flight attendants were unfriendly, straight faces, no smiles at all during the flight. the food was sucks. the room leg was good, but no in-flight entertainments during 3 hours flight to ho chi minh city then connect to 2 hours flight to hanoi. bored to death!"
847,Karl S,4,"We find Vietnam Airlines the best value for money business class option from Australia to Europe. <br><br>Since they introduced the free visa, transfer and hotel stopover program the trip got even better. <br><br>Good food and drink and friendly service. Always on time.<br><br>B777 to SGN is a bit tired, but offers plenty of room, even if seats only recline about 160 degrees. <br><br>Stopover in Saigon is long enough for a bit of shopping and dinner.<br><br>B787 to London is fantastic with fully flat beds.<br><br>We returned on the A350 from Paris and found the flat beds a bit more narrow compared to B 787. However still very good.<br><br>A return trip will get you to Skyteam gold status and another one way within a year to platinum status.<br><br>If you don't mind the stopover in Vietnam, a very good choice."
847,KiwiRoverJim,5,"This is my latest travel discovery.<br><br>I flew VN London-Hanoi-Singapore. The leg to Hanoi was on the 787 Dreamliner, an aircraft that I enjoy flying on. The Business cabin was immaculately presented, the seat modules very comfortable and with plenty of nooks and crannies for stowing bits and pieces. When the time came to sleep, the lief-flat was all that you would expect.<br><br>Service was pitched just right - attentive without being intrusive. The all-female crew were absolutely gracious with a ready smile. I just couldn't fault them. And the food was delicious. What more can you ask? I couldn't have been more pleased with the whole experience.<br><br>The flight Hanoi-Singapore was on an A321 and not quite the same flight experience, but I accept that this is a regional aircraft and expectations are different. Having said that, the crew once again were totally charming and delivered the service with a gracious smile.<br><br>The only sour note with this trip was the check-in at Heathrow. The check-in is performed by a local handling agent and I have never encountered anywhere the total incompetence I encountered that day. I came very close to being denied boarding on the basis that I did not hold a visa that I knew only too well that I did not need. There was quite a lengthy discussion, they stood their ground and in the end I had to take them through their own documentation, line by line, until I managed to convince them that I was right and they weren't. No apology. The closest I got was ""my colleague must have mis-read it"". So true, sadly. I was left with the impression of a bunch of part-time, under-trained, staff. If I were VN management I'd be reviewing the contract because it simply wasn't good enough. And if anyone's checking this, the flight in question was VN54/04SEP LHR-HAN."
847,Antonio G,4,Very friendly staff in the check in in Kuala Lumpur Airport. Good space and very clean airplane. Departure and arrive on time. I also have travelled from Hanoi to Hong Kong and the service was equal.
848,JEAN M,3,"After reading some of the reviews for this airline that were awful I was very apprehensive before our flight but it turned out so much better than expected.We had 2 international and 3 internal flights and all of them were on time,all the crews were very polite and helpful,our check ins on all flights were speedy with plenty of check in desks.My only criticism would be that the food was awful,I don't expect any airline food to be good but it was particularly bad,it would have been nice if there had been some snacks to purchase as 13 hrs is a long time if your not able to eat the food,also the audio system was really bad,I had read reviews about this so I wasn't surprised,we had a good part of our flight at night and our return flight at night so it really didn't affect us too much,these are the reasons I have scored a 3."
848,JONHallettCove J,4,"We had a short, no nonsense internal flight from Hanoi to Hue. The flight was very brief and we arrived early.<br>The staff were well-dressed, polite and efficient. We got the hot-towel and cold water service because the flight was ahead of time, The aircraft was comfortable, clean and had quite reasonable leg room (A321, I think).<br>Great landing and a pleasant farewell from the crew."
848,Sofi NS,3,"is basically a monopoly in the area of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos.<br>Check in procedures are usually fast a efficient. The planes are better than other cheap local Regionals. However food and entertainment for short distances either don't exist or are below par. I wouldn't fly long distance flights with it an th problem is that since it monopolized many short distance roots tends to be expensive. Overall OK"
848,Dave R,4,"For the price paid, which was just a bit more than the budget airlines, we had no complaints.  No frills, but no complaints.  Both Saigon and Danang airports seem to have improved since last time I was there several years ago."
848,HNT,1,"Have been travelling to different places around the World with different airlines and I have to say VN airlines has the worst web check-in system I've ever seen. Not only the system is slow, unresponsive, unintuitive, but also it ridiculously limits the service being available to only passengers departing from a small number of cities. Melbourne, Sydney, US cities,... are not included. <br><br>If you are a traveller who normally does web checkin before any flight and doesn't want to waste time queuing at an airport, avoid this airlines."
849,Betty R,3,"We travel with Vietnam Air very frequently, about 1 time per month. It is easy to book tickets, the service is very good and the delays are less than some other Asian Airlines. The seats are tighter than Western Airlines , so sometimes if you sit next to big people you are quite squished!"
849,Yanlord,1,"I usually take Skyteam airliners for mileage collection and it was my first time to take VN. I used to have a great impression of Vietnamese food and people so would try it. But it turned out to be disaster. I stopped over HCM airport and lounge was not well maintained. And then I become panic when I was on board to Sydney as my seat was broken and was not declined. Business class was fully booked out so I was supposed to fly with seat still for 10 hours in Business class. Cabin manager was trying to express sorry and promised to send me a voucher to compensate on my discomfort. However, for 10 months no contact from VN. So I tried to check if I still get it. But reply was just I am sorry. Fortunately I had an evidence and sent it to the airliner but answer was same. I didn't expect big return it just some expression of sorry. As a frequent traveler, I have taken many airliners but I can tell VN should be the worst. Brand of airliner is not coming from facilities but should be from the mindset of service."
849,Scottiehere,4,"Nothing to complain about at all. Efficient, clean, friendly and would have nor problems flying with again."
849,Scottiehere,4,"On time smooth flight, check in easy slightly delayed but no big issue. Quite a enjoyable experience,"
849,Ruki E,1,From New Zealand as I was planning our tour in Vietnam name I booked two sectors - from Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh City and 5 days later to Da Nang from Ho Ch Minh. For family reasons I had to cancel my sector from Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh. I flew straight to Ho Chi Minh to start out tour. Could you believe that Vietnam Airlines would not honour my sector from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang as I had not used the first sector. I didn't request a refund for the first sector but I had paid for both sectors. They said if I didn't fly the first sector the second sector automatically gets cancelled! I had to buy a new ticket.<br>So beware... Don't EVER book two different flights tigether! You just don't know when you may have change ir cancel your reservations. Finally when we did go to the depature lounge flight was delayed by 4hrs. We were never told! Just guessed by other passengers reactions.
850,Ian M,2,"This was a sub-standard almost deceptive flight offer that no-one at Helloworld would have taken themselves - a dud offer and an embarrassing mistake on my part for not realising that devil was in the lack of detail and what was NOT said.<br>For two people we paid an extra $270 plus two trips to Sydney to get Vietnam visas, we had to take a domestic flight from Saigon to Hanoi which meant inconvenience and additional baggage handling and an extra 6 hours to the trip to Paris.<br>The flight from Hanoi to Paris took about 12 hours and we got one meal and some snack and soft drink rubbish for breakfast.<br>The flight back from Paris had a 12 hour layover in Saigon, so we stayed at a hotel in the city for another $200.<br>Food and service was a bit better on the return trip but after this experience, I would not trust Helloworld an inch as I believe they sell without knowing what they are selling or even worse, if they did know, then they are knowingly selling inferior product."
850,Hannah O,1,"Terrible experience with this company!! My flight was delayed meaning I missed two connections, I understand this happens but the way I was treated as a young woman travelling alone was awful and the attitude of the lady who dealt with me was unacceptable. I waited in the airport for over 12 hours (as the flight they moved to was also delayed) I was given one meal in the airport cafe which was inedible and was then told I couldn't have any food on a 12 hour flight as they did not have the vegetarian meal I had pre ordered. I was then forced to wait another 6 hours in Paris for a connecting flight even though I am fully aware there are several a day. Since my return I have tried to contact them multiple times and I am being completely ignored, I can only presume because they know they are in the wrong in this situation!"
850,Carocrotte,2,"I recently flew Vietnam Airways from London to the Philippines and then back from Singapore to London. Although the flight was alright it was the appalling  service I received when my daughter fell ill in Singapore and was deemed unfit to fly for 5 days.We were due to fly that evening, but I could not get hold of any Vietnam representative as the offices were closed. I wanted to rebook my daughter onto another flight. I went to the airport early, but again there was no Vietnam Airways rep there. At check in they told me to go to transfer desk in Saigon to rebook her flight. When I got to the desk in Saigon the rep was nowhere to be seen and he told someone else he would email me???? I insisted that he book her onto another flight as I had left her in Singapore and wanted to make sure she had a flight to come home when she was better. The guy who was at the desk understood my anxiety and sent by phone the paperwork to VA rep. An hour later I had a booking for the Friday eve. <br>When I got back to London I checked on this booking and I was told she was on a waiting list.This was never mentioned in Saigon. My daughter went to the office in Singapore and she was told she was not even on the flight and there was no space for at least 10 more days. I emailed the airlines and no one has responded. In the end I had to fork out  £1000 to get her home on another airline. Vietnam Airways were unprofessional and did not oblige by their contract for someone with a medical certificate. For this reason I will not fly  with them again."
850,Wingc633,4,"I travelled in September, it was departed Bangkok at the mid-night. That was why not so many passengers there. One person occupied one row, it was quite comfortable, the width between front row was much better than cheap airlines but the tickets included 20kg luggage. The price was very competitive.<br>The cabin crew were friendly.<br>The price divided into several grade even for economic class, it would be cheaper if you can plan your trip earlier."
850,Robbo44Melbourne,3,"Service was not to good going and as my wife was ill we had to constantly ask for water for her. It seemed hard work for them. On time, food ordinary. Internal flights were better than International. No problems with them. Only problem we had was on returning to Australia was the amount of ahnd luggage they allowed in the cabin. One man had more in the overhead locker than I had checked baggage"
851,debski,3,All we knew about Vietnam Airlines before boarding our flight was that they seem to offer a 1st class service in losing baggage!  Check in was no different or better than for standard for economy class. Our luggage didn't attract priority labels unlike Eva Air. But the seats were very roomy and comfortable. Can't say anything about the in-flight entertainment because I prefer to read a book. But it seemed that Vietnamese subtitles took up most of the screen when my husband was trying to watch a film. Food (veggie option)  was way better than most airlines. I even ate some of it!
851,edu48d,2,"My wife and I joined the Lotusmiles programme with Vietnam Airlines in May 2016. We have flown with them to the UK and to Vietnam on three occasions. <br>We are still to receive our membership cards and miles need to be added to our accounts.<br>When we ask in Thailand, it has to be done in Saigon, but today nobody could be bothered. We produced our boarding passes for the journeys we have taken but it was too much trouble for them.<br>It is a real shame but I will not use this airline again and am very disappointed in the lack of quality one receives when trying to sort out a problem.<br>Today check in was terribly slow, even though there were two members of staff on every desk!!! We were told to go to different people in the airport regarding our Airmiles, before finally being told that we had to go to HQ in Saigon itself!!!!<br>We will pay more money in future and use quality airlines such as Singapore, Eva, Qatar etc. I suggest everyone else does too.<br>You have a great deal to learn Vietnam Airlines."
851,efsharo,5,"all went OK. suitcases arrived, no delay. only water, no snack, but it is not so important in short flight."
851,the_beach86,2,"Vietnam Airlines runs old metal (until recently), entertainment was still centralised (overhead TVs), uncomfortable seats and expensive. Shop elsewhere."
851,Worldhopper8,5,Great check-in staff and friendly cabin crew.<br>Food quality is good and seats can be pre-booked without any additional charge.<br>It is important to check the flight times though as the airline can change these more than once after you have booked your ticket.
852,Patricia032,3,"I travel non stop London to Ho Chi Min in the new Dreamer A380 business class. The service is below standard in comparison with other carriers. To make matter worst the seat belt is extremely short. To the point I was asked to moved to premium economy where the seat belt are of normal length as was roomy enough  not to use it at it full length. The food service is pretty basic as well, and if that is business class I dreaded to think what will be in economy. I would not use the service again unless I can get a price that is worth to buy it. On the other hand my time in premium economy (for take off and landed) showed me quite roomy seats so maybe is worth to consider it."
852,Karen M,5,"We have travelled with Vietnam airlines for the past 6 years. They offer a great price on a business class fare to Europe and Vietnam is a great place for a stop over. During this time we have had some pretty ordinary flights, but you can have bad experiences on any airline.<br>But this year I have noticed a great improvement in their service and facilities. The flight to and from Saigon to Paris was on the 787 and 350 respectively, with a flat bed and large screen tv. They now have a new lounge in Saigon international airport which is up to the standard of the premium lounges, in fact better than the qantas lounge in Melbourne.<br>Keep up the good work!!!"
852,Kenneth_from_Cal,3,Our family of four flew Vietnam Airlines August 3rd on their new Boeing 787 Dreamliner from HAN to SGN.  It was our first time flying this airline and our first time on the 787.  Our flight was uneventful.  Kudos to the agent at the ticket counter who moved my wife and I into the exit row so we were able to stretch out.  (This would never happen with a U.S. airline unless we paid more or had an elevated status in the FFP).  The food was poor (and I eat most airline food) and I did not try the entertainment system.  Overall I would put Vietnam Airlines above any of the big three U.S. airlines but a notch below Asian airlines such as Cathay Pacific and EVA Airlines.
852,Phil T,5,"Not wanting to pay the approx $8000 cost flying Business Class Perth to London with Qantas, I opted to travel mixed class. Economy Perth to Singapore with Qantas and Singapore to London, Business Class with Vietnam Airlines. The Qantas flight was as cramped as being a sardine in a can. The V.A. was a lay flat seat, excellent food and arriving at London Fresh. The Business Lounges were good at Singapore, Hanoi and London Heathrow. The cabin staff were not as classically dressed as say Emirates but the service and food were good. The V.A. flight cost $2500, plus Qantas. Total around $3000. I would certainly fly with Vietnam Airlines again."
852,Xouxounette,5,The online check in from the VN airline website making us more comfy and we can choose the seats we want. The staff with the big smile and welcoming guest.  Love it's.
853,LJB610,1,"A sad fact that even patriotic Vietnamese refer to the national airline as ""Sorry Airlines"". The reason for this, is the airline has built a reputation for consistently apologizing to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights. You can sense the embarrassment of the front line staff as they yet again have to make excuses for a delayed flight. <br>Our recent flight from Da Lat back to Hanoi was delayed by over 4 hours. According to the airline , due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft , yet they advised the delay the day before ! There was another delay on top of the already advised delay and our 16:30 arrival time became a 22:30 arrival. <br>The aircraft parked at a gate but we were then bussed to the terminal in pouring rain . The bus driver was too lazy to even get as close to the terminal as possible to minimize how wet his passengers got. Our luggage, marked as priority was among the last to appear on the belt. While the flight attendants are great , the ground staff have much to learn in the way of customer service. They all seem to have the attitude , the airline is there to provide them with a job, not provide a service to customers. These days other options are available for Vietnam internal flights and we will certainly be more inclined to book with those carriers in future."
853,Chris L,1,Flight was due to depart at 1pm and whilst we are all sat onboard waiting to back away from gate they announce its been changed to 8pm due to weather in Hanoi. <br><br>Only issue is 4 flights from VietJet leave from Na Trang to Hanoi all on time whilst we have to wait in airport. <br><br>No information from staff and no help at all. <br><br>I thought Vietnam airlines would be better than Viet Jet but wrong.
853,BKK111,1,"Arrived from Nha Trang with over 2 hours to spare. Reached check in counters with 1.45 to spare. Stood waiting in queue for at least half an hour. Three queues barely moving. Spoke to a supervisor who said just wait. Spoke to a manager who sId the same and refused to switch long waiting customers to empty business lines. ""Manager"" refused to listen to me, preferred to talk over me. Refused to given his name or staff number. With just 45 mins to spare they called all Bangkok customers to the business check ins. At least security were a little better and rushed people through. Then VN Air delayed the flight anyway.<br>Flown this airline many times, fine in the air, useless in very other aspect. If only Air Asia had better timings."
853,KLTravel15,4,"The service and food were excellent on both planes. KL to Hanoi and Hanoi to Paris. The Hanoi to Paris flight had fabulous seat, great for the 12 hour journey. Only disappointment on the trip was the poor standard of the lounge Hanoi airport."
853,William P,5,"Boarded the flight in Hanoi International Airport, where the service in the check in counters was fast and smooth. The plane was new and clean and on board the flight the inflight entertainment system was working without a flaw. It was a pleasure flying with Vietnam Airlines and I would happily do it again."
854,tumbleweeds023,2,"The flight was fine. Food quality was acceptable if not awesome, and airline staff was attentive and efficient. So why only 3 stars?<br><br>When we arrived in Hanoi, we headed over to the shuttle buses to get a ride into the city, and went straight to the Vietnam Airlines van. The driver quoted us the outrageous price of 300,000 VND (almost US$15) for the two of us. Since I live in Hanoi and know how much the actual fare is - 40,000 VND (less than US$2), I said no way! He then said ""Ok, 200,000 VND then!""<br><br>This is not a budget airline and I expected better service. As it turned out, we took the VietJet Airlines shuttle bus for just 40,000 VND per person, no hassle at all, and he took us right to our house. <br><br>So a word to the wise on this. I did contact Vietnam Airlines directly to complain about the price gouging. Meanwhile, just know that there are several shuttle companies that operate out of Noi Bai Airport and the fare should not exceed 40,000 dong. I've heard other reports of Vietnamese being charged 40,000 dong for the Vietnam Airlines shuttle bus while foreigners are routinely overcharged. Now I know that it's true."
854,Thomas H,2,"We were going for a domestic flight from Hanoi to Hue in the morning, but just 5 before we were supposed to start boarding the flight got postponed by two hours without us receiving any particular information as to why.On the flight, though, the staff was very nice."
854,szkut,5,"After flying a lot of budget flights on a trip through Asia this felt like luxury. We managed to get a really good cheap deal as we booked quite early. Seats are big, got a light snack and drink and plane was clean.<br><br>Felt like flying our Australian Qantas which is always a bit more expensive but always a comfortable flight."
854,Dennis O,4,"This flight uses the 787, which is all decked out in modern individual seats with plenty of storage and a flat bed. To be honest, I did not find this flight as comfortable as my previous one on the 777. The new configuration seems to be tighter and more restrictive. At least that’s my opinion.<br>The food was very good and equal in standard to my previous comments. The service was not as high maybe because it’s a long night flight but the staff just did not seem to be as attentive.<br>Don’t select row 1, as its near where the staff are active and near one of the toilets. I would think 3 or 4 would be better."
854,Dennis O,4,"Travelled Bus Class and must say that the experience was very good. I have had the opportunity to use other BC flights before and this experience stood up well against any others.<br>The plane is a 777-200 and is a little dated, but the seats were comfortable, even for a big guy like me. They also can fold down to almost flat, but I had no trouble sleeping for a few hours.<br>The service was excellent 5 out of 5. The food was really good, far too much. I felt that I would explode with all the courses. The lunch, which is about 2 hours after take-off had 6 courses, not all individually large servings, but very filling. The quality could not be faulted.<br>The front BC toilet is large, by comparison, and was always tidy and clean.<br>I would recommend rows 2-4, as you get some holding space with those seats. <br>Will be interested to see how the next pat of the trip compares to Frankfurt.<br>Well worth the extra for the business class."
855,David W,4,I flew on Vietnam Airlines from London Heathrow to Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh City. It was difficult to ascertain beforehand whether I needed a transit visa but after visiting the airlines office in London I was assured that this was not required for business class passenger. The offerings of the Skyteam lounge at HCMC where Ispent most of the four hour layover were more geared to the local traveller thjan the international traveller.
855,Cgcnewyork,4,"I was in premium economy,the highest class offered .This gives the passenger priority seating,fast lanes at security and access to the airport lounge-where I happily found several international newspapers.<br>After flying 6 or 7 times with VA ,I am reaching the conclusion that the planes are relatively new,the pilots skilled,and the staff friendly and attentive.<br><br>Food and beverages still a work in progress,however, are very good and heading toward excellent.<br>For first timers ,please do not hesitate to fly this airline."
855,Nic R,5,"The plane was clean and there was plenty of legroom. I wasn't expecting food on the flight, but we got a meal &amp; it was lovely. As we were late departing, the lady who checked us in realised that we would have a very hard time making our connecting flight, so unbeknownst to us, she contacted Jetstar to have someone waiting as we got off. Great service from Vietnam Airlines - we made our connecting flight!"
855,Barry Webster,2,I flew Vietnam Airlines to Danang last october and was impressed with the service overall.But going back this july .what a contrast.The plains were quite scruffy on the outside and the maintainance inside was terrible.On the way over my overhead light didnt work so i couldnt read.And my t v didnt work so I had 12 hours just sitting in my seat doing nothing so on the way back my tv didnt work along with probably 30%of the others.They apologised and said they would contact  me but 2 weeks later still no word.I will never fly Vietnam Airlines again..
855,Ash K,1,Did 4 flights with this airline visiting Nha Trang from Singapore via ho chi min city. <br>They don't use the air bridge. 2 of the busses didn't have air conditioning. The stroller is taken from you by the plane (you have to do 1 or 2 set of stairs before that and you only get it back on the baggage carousel! <br>Very disappointing and uncomfortable experience. I'll avoid them if I can.
856,scott0511,4,I flew for the first time with Vietnam Airlines from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City.<br>I was very impressed with the service and particularly the food. This was some of the best food I have experienced on any airline.<br>Was an old B777-200 plane and the seat did not recline fully but I have read these planes are being replaced by B787-9s later this year.<br>Great service Vietnam Airlines!
856,alsmba,1,"Flew 7 times with Vietnam Airlines in 3,5 weeks.<br>All flights were delayed, and most had changes to their boarding gates after check in.<br>The flights between Sydney - Ho Chi Minh and Ho Chi Minh - Sydney (VN772 and VN773) conducted on aged (approx 13 year old) Boeing 777's are the worst I have ever flown. <br><br>Rude cabin staff, broken IFE (some 3,5 weeks later on the exact same aircraft registration VNA146 it was still broken), broken toilet cupboards (some 3,5 weeks later on the exact same aircraft registration VNA146 it was still broken) bland poor quality food, no menus, more rude cabin staff, etc.<br><br>Broken IFE seems a common complaint amongst others we have spoken to who have had the misfortune to travel on Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines appears to treat this route and its Australian customers as cattle, herding them onto aircraft that in our experience did not have relevant repairs made.<br>Why advertise IFE services when they do not work and have not for a while?<br><br>With long term unrepaired aircraft problems clearly visible, I would feel safer flying with another airline."
856,Robert B,2,"I have never experienced such a let down in 20 years of flying with National Airlines.<br>Arriving with sufficient time for my Flight , myself and the rest of the passengers were advised of 5 different Boarding gates for the Flight. It was only after the 3rd change on the Notice Boards was an announcement made. This was then subject to 2 further changes.<br>At one point 2 International Flights were leaving the same gate within 50 minutes of each other.<br>The Plane eventually departed just over 1 hour late, after the Airline had a ' Technical demarcation dispute'.<br>Service on board was very poor, the Food badly prepared and very bland, the Flight Crew conspiuous by their absence and very dour in their Service and attitude .<br>The In Flight entrtainment had a mind of it's own, regularly changing options and ending the programs.<br>To view the Airlines description of itself and to then experience the package, left me wondering had the person who dreamed up the Airlines review been travelling on another Airline, Qatar or Emirates Airlines. The reality did NOT match the imagionation of the writer."
856,Lesley N,1,"Recently had 7 fights on a 6 week trip and none of these flights were any better in fact got worse.Ground staff good but in flight staff terrible. Towel given on boarding and a meal 90 min latter, the food was good with a bottle of water given at the end of the meal but that was it. no staff member came near us until the next meal 8 hours latter, no water, no snacks nothing. The only time we saw staff outside boarding and leaving the planes, with no attempt to say anything in English but the basics like chicken or beef. On the last leg of our journey my husbands seat was broken as was the tray table and when he complained, the hostess didn't understand a word he said and didn't even attempt to.<br>none f the flights left on time even after boarding, seats were very tight and uncomfortable with no leg room causing my feet to swell which has never happened before. I am a female of average height and weigh,and have traveled on many airlines and this has to have been the worst experience I have ever had. as I said NEVER AGAIN."
856,Billy D,1,"Cancelled our flight then put us on a later one regardless of the onward cost to us then we are put on standby on an over subscribed flight ??? So they have overbooked this flight so was never a chance of us getting on this flight, not very good in terms of customer service or taking responsibility and accountability , can't believe I will use them again after this experience"
857,kevint61,5,"We booked return tickets with Vietnam Airlines to travel between Hanoi and Paris, the service was really good with new aircraft A530 Scarlet. The seat was bigger and very comfortable and the food provided on board was delicious. This is a 4 star airline company!"
857,pieata,3,"Full plane. Seating adequate , austere interior , hostess did average job,not good not bad!   I think there is a Business class, but couldn't distinguish, all looked the same.<br>I filled up at HCM before boarding , so when food came  around, I wasn't  interested, it LOOKED edible, but noticed some not finished.( maybe not hungry, like me?)<br>Like most flights,smooth take off and landing. Too busy looking out the window to look at entertainment..<br>Time passed quickly, looking at the forests and agricultural scenery below,  and then we were landing.<br>Nothing significant or special re plane or flight, I had NO CHOICE, as QF don't fly to Hanoi, just HCM city!<br>Recommend, if you have no choice , other than car/bus???<br>Hanoi accessed by Dragon(KF) from HK?"
857,Denise R,2,Check in went smoothly.The problems began as the plane was taking off with people wandering around the plane. The flight crew didn't appear to be overly concerned. People were kneeling on their seats speaking to people behind them so they obviously didn't have their seat belts fastened. The same happened as the plane landed. Passenger safety didn't appear to be an issue. The seat in front of ours was fastened to the wall by a cable tie which would have been amusing if it wasn't such a major safety issue.
857,LorrainePAustralia,5,"Our son travelled with Vietnam Airlines in 2011 or 2012, so we weren't expecting much, going by his description. We travelled from Hanoi to Paris at a very cheap rate in September 2015 and couldn't believe it! New plane (and they are adding more), fantastic service, menus for meals, free use of pillows/blankets. Five star service at a such a cheap price! Will definitely fly with them again!"
857,Pam A,1,"I have flown for many years....even worked for an airline a few years back. But Vietnam airlines must be one of the worse i have ever had the misfortune of flying with. I flew with this company out last Thursday night. Prior to take off i had to bring to the attention of a flight attendant that there were 2 passengers still talking on their mobiles as we were taxiing down the runway. Bad enough yes but trust me it gets worse....just before descent into sydney, i went to the bathroom but could not enter due to the stench of cigarette smoke. Once again brought to the attention of flight staff but simply got a shrug of the shoulders &amp; a smile. So trust me people stay away from this airline...disgusting disgusting disgusting."
858,ShelleyM966,5,"We had three trips on Vietnam Airlines from Hanoir to Danang to Saigon and then Saigon to Singapore.  Every flight left on time (or only had a very slight delay to due to the incoming flight being slightly late).  On line check in made the actual baggage check super speedy. The staff were helpful and pleasant.  The gate space at the Airports was comfortable and adequate for the passengers (unlike Terminal 5 where a BA flight to Singapore overcrowded the Gate and had many standing waiting).  We had to check out bags through to Heathrow in Saigon and it was straightforward and our bags arrived safely.  Even though the flights were short, we got given towels and water, and a meal for a 90 minute flight.  Our kids are vegan and vegetarian and they provided meals specifically for them.  The leg room was very good -- a million times better than, say, Easyjet, where tall people really struggle. We were very impressed and would go long haul with them as well in the future"
858,Colin L,3,"As a full service airlines, Vietnam Airlines is not exactly my top choice. <br><br>Saying that, price wise, it is significantly cheaper than Singapore Airlines.<br><br>One thing I cannot understand is the number of flights to Hanoi from Singapore. Only two flights per day and in a rather small aircraft. What was a real downer was the lack of personal screens for inflight entertainment. Even what was screened, lacked thought and imagination.<br><br>Have been on domestic flights between Saigon and Hanoi and the planes are a lot nicer and with much better inflight entertainment.<br><br>In flight service was average. Nothing much to write home about.<br><br>One final note is the check in process st the airport in Hanoi. Just one word. Nightmare.<br><br>Even though I checked in online with no checkin baggage, I had to wait in a snaking line to present my credentials. I am not saying that this is not necessary but why have a separate counter for Internet checkin passengers when you have to wait in the queue with the other passengers who have not?<br><br>Is internet checkin suppose to expedite the check in process?"
858,Merc9SLK,3,"We've travelled to Vietnam on 4 occasions since 2012 and flown with Vietnam airlines on each occasion.<br><br>The airline has always flown on time and online check in including a free choice of seats is available to ""all"". Quite a refreshing change when other airlines greedily charge for this service which essentially is VFM for the airline rather than time and resources at the check in desk.<br><br>Always flown economy, to be fair there is ample leg room. When we first flew with this airline - the planes were spotless, travel extras such as a small pouch were given containing a tiny toothbrush, earplugs and the essential eye patches! Yet on this flight and the return leg of our travels - no little essentials.  Fortunately, we'd retained our eye patches from an earlier flight and patches from Ethiad so we could block out the light and rest.<br><br>The food, quite frankly is dire. I'd rather not eat or take a picnic on board. When we first flew in 2012 it was lovely and with all scheduled flights a wee dram was complimentary along with a glass of wine with your meal.   Now, I'm not a drinker on a flight as I prefer to keep my wits about me however the wine was served in a thimble.  Ok a big thimble but it was tiny, so on previous flights they replenish a few times..........err not on this flight!<br><br>Lights out, all out as soon as the meal was over, the cabin crew clearly wanting an easy flight.  The crew whilst ""ok"" we're not the friendliest we have encountered.<br><br>Luggage has never been damaged or broken into unlike Malaysian airlines.<br><br>Would I fly again, yes if I want to go to Vietnam as there is little other choice.  Would be happier if they flew from Manchester or Newcastle, rather than drive from the North East of England for several hours to get a flight from Heathrow.  The first time we flew it was from Gatwick so at least some element of choice.<br><br>During the same holiday we had internal flights from Hanoi to Da'Nang now that was a flight to remember. The cabin crew were so blaze they didn't operate any visual safety precautions and were hardly seen throughout the flight as they all congregated in the galley to the rear with the curtain closed.  When you did see a flight attendant they nonchalantly strolled up the plane not even standing up straight, slouched shoulders - you could have mistaken them for a rooky crew or even worse the flight had been taken over.<br><br>Prior to taxing down the runway at Hanoi, a stewardess asked a young man to put his seat upright - it was laid at a 45 degree angle with his blanket over his head.  She also asked him to turn off his mobile phone which he was pursuing and texting friends discreetly.  He agreed and as soon as she left he undid his seatbelt and reclined the seat looking at his phone and what appeared to be Facebook.<br><br>The stewardess didn't return for a final check of the cabin and the young man then laid out across the central 3 seats, no seatbelt and put the blanket over his head looking at his phone underneath.<br><br>So, was that it? Noooooo, so we are now taxing down the side of the runway, an old boy stood up at the far side of the plane and slowly walked to the rear towards the galley.  We couldn't believe it. The steward sat in his Crewe seat facing the passengers and watched him making no attempt to beckon him to sit down.  The old boy then walked slowly back to his seat just as we were about to embark on take off.<br><br>Needless to say I didn't rest on this short internal flight, you really couldn't have made it up, a real life comedy sketch but not so funny when you're sat part of it with your safety in ""others"" hands."
858,WendyPk,4,"We couldn't fault anything on this part of our journey.   The service was friendly, the food was amazing, the movies were great.  We'll done VN Airlines."
858,John M,3,"The flight over was not too bad, except we had quite a lengthy stop over in Saigon, but the flight home was terrible, stopping in Hanoi even though we were in transit to Saigon, we had to go through immigration , collect our cases (although we were told they had been booked through). So never again, yes we are very slow learners as this was our third trip to Europe with Vietnam Airlines, we just kept thinking they would improve things, but that just didnt happen!!"
859,balooca,2,"my connecting flight got cancelled due to typhoon in Japan. First of all the airline never called to stated that it was canceled, they waited until i got there and told me that i had to go home. I waited in line for 30 mins for them to tell me that I have go to another booth where I waited for another 45mins. Then they told me to go to the 3rd place again to have the tickets rebooked. It took them 45 mins to rebook my ticket, said everything was done, and that I would just gave the booking number to get my boarding pass for the next connecting flights in Tokyo. Got to tokyo and apparently they don't have the information of my booking, and I still have to wait for a long long time. If vietnam airline had done their job properly in the first place ( because they supposed to add some information when they re-booked my connecting flights  ), I wouldnot have to waste so much time like this"
859,Andrew K,4,"I was a little dubious at first but was happily surprised when we completed our travel. We were on a modern Airbus with all the features expected on any other full service airline. Would not hesitate to fly with them again.<br><br>The meals were good and comprehensive with a Vietnamese or a European. choice. I went for the Vietnamese option and was very happy. The drink service was sufficient during the meals, however the not seen very much between services.<br><br>The staff were efficient but may have been in the cabin a bit more.<br><br>We also undertook internal flights to Da Nang with the same experience."
859,FlatCHongKong,5,"There are couple of different airlines btw Hong Kong and Hanoi. I chose Vietnam Airlines in late May 2016, and it worked perfectly. They had that Vietnamese lime green tea too. Great choice!"
859,Nev Tickner,4,"Love the simplicity of the trip to the famous battle city ......... never long queues, a very casual flight ..... by the time you've glanced through the inflight magazine it's time to land.  For anyone visiting for the first time it is the opportunity of a lifetime to look down upon the city and the historic battle sites and to see the traditional Thai villages that skirt the perimeter of the valley is like looking back in time ....... I say it is the best short trip in country and cheap as."
859,mesctravel,4,"We flew Vietnam Airlines business for all our flights while travelling through Asia. <br>The flights were on time, with only one being slightly delayed but only by 10-15 minutes. <br>On our flights we experienced breakfast which I was surprised at how good it was. <br>Dinner snack as shorter flight which was two pieces of bread with topping although came with some form of fish wish I wasn't sure about and didnt eat. <br><br>The lounges are average, at least to Western Standard but certain areas were great. The best lounge was Hanoi which was well equipped. Nha trang was small although provided some nice basics. Hue lounge whilst seating was nice the food selection was terrible. And by far the worst was Ho Chi Minh. Lounge good selection decent although many pastries were old. The chair and floors were simply revolting. <br><br>Legroom of the flight was decent, chairs were also quite comfortable although business does not have personal screens in order to watch your own screen."
860,HK_Traveller05,3,"It's a very short flight. The staff were nice, and the pilot in general was good. Amazing view of Danang or Hanoi if you sit on the left hand side (facing front). Great magazines on board, be sure to read the Heritage. The Heritage Fashion can be quite repetitive with style and content. <br>What's provided: Water, Wet tissue<br>What's not provided: Blanket, Food<br>It's nice to be able to use the walkway instead of taking the bus. In my opinion this is also a nice flight to take in terms of timing because you have time to enjoy breakfast, check out, then head to the airport. <br>Legroom is good if you sit right behind Business Class (row 10). The plane is a bit old."
860,AmyMagg02,5,"I chose Vietnamairlines for my round trip to Singapore because it's direct flight. The plane was boarding on time, the staff was friendly as one of the cabin crew was from Korea. The food was good and well prepared. In general the service so far is the best airline in Vietnam."
860,Debbie S,4,"New plane on both parts of trip, staff helpful and pleasant, large seats and more importnatly large TV screens. Didn't eat the food as i cant eat on planes. Toilets clean, even at the end of the flight."
860,SwizerlandRoisinDubh,5,"3 flights with VN Airlines in one week, and the same experience each time: just really, really good! Good equipment, friendly staff, great experience. The A 350 BTW is one hell of a plane....fantastic. Will defeinetly take them again: is getting mighty close to SIngapore Airlines...."
860,병국 박,1,"This airline was total disaster of my trip. In fact, the service in the cabin was not so bad. Everything else? It was awful.<br>First, they never keep the flight time. Never. I flew with this airline 4 times, and they delayed hours 3 times. The other one? It was cancelled.<br>Furthermore, they never aware any information you need, until boarding time has come. If you ask to them to get any information, for example, ‘Why the boarding is not started? It’s the time.’, then you will be ignore. Even you cannot trust their website. My flight, from Dalat to Hochmin 8am, was ""on time"" on their website when I heard that was cancelled in airport. Of course, there was no announcement for that before I asked.<br>It's not over. Not yet. If you have trouble because of their flight, they NEVER, NEVER do anything for you. When my flight was cancelled, they just gave me a funny, simple paper that confirming ""this flight was cancelled."" and that's everything they did for me. I asked to them is there any other transport which I can use, and they gave me a little memo written a phone number without any explanation. Of course, it could not help me, because it was a local bus company so they couldn't speak English at all. But they didn't care.<br>And, refund. You have to have a long, long trip to get a refund. I tried to get a refund at Dalat, it was ignored. I tried that second time in Hochimin, and they tossed me from an office to another office. They noticed me that I have to go to head office, and that was third office I visited. The head office was not in airport. Needless to say, the only favor they gave for me was the address of the head office on a tiny memo. Now you can see, the biggest favor they give you is a memo without explanation.<br>Do not fly with this horrifying airline if you don’t want to spend your precious time in airport and searching another transport. I can guarantee you that you will be exhausted and angry because of them. I recommend you recommending this airline to screw up someone’s trip who you hate. That is Vietnam airline’s specialty.<br>I’m writing this review, in anger, waiting their delayed flight for 3hours. Do not make a fool decision like me because of cheap price. There is always a reason for such things."
861,Paris T,4,"The flight was ok was not up there to long, this was a very small plane, the staff where good, even tho nothing to do."
861,Herbie15,2,"Understandably you can't expect first world service from an airline from Vietnam, so I suppose you get what you pay for. Two flights, one Hanoi to Hue and the other Da Nang to Ho Chi Min. First flight struck turbulence and lightning. I feel lucky we flew at night. Second flight delayed twice before we got to be airport and then again while there. Very unreliable. The gate changed without notice and had to find out ourselves. <br><br>Screen between business and economy didn't close, nor did one of the tv screens. Got concerned when steam suddenly filled the cabin and the landing gear seemed to have problems. Cabin staff appeared busy, with forced friendliness. No meal just a bottle of water and a commercial face towel. Seats very uncomfortable and gave me a sore back for the next few days. <br><br>Would definitely check out another airline or possibly a bus next time. An experience in 2nd world flight."
861,Toniiniman,4,"Just a perfect trip, good food in a brand new plane, first time but i will fly again with them.<br>Gentle staff on board, a mot of care for kids."
861,Mirage O,5,"Excellent services were provided from priority check-in, to complimentary use of SATS Premier Lounge while waiting to board the flight in Singapore. Enjoyed a glass of champagne after boarding and fine wine to compliment a superb lunch. Upon arrival in Hanoi, we found our baggage had been unloaded first and waiting for us to collect near the carousel. Top class service!"
861,elizabethbevington,5,"On August 5, 2016 one of our party was to fly back to Hanoi, Vietnam from Siem Reap, Cambodia.  I had made the reservations for a 2 country tour that began and ended in Hanoi.  I had also arranged for the visa for Vietnam.  Unfortunately, I realized at the last minute, literally 2 hours before her flight, that because I booked the Siem Reap - Hanoi ticket separately with Vietnam Airlines, and the round trip US - Hanoi part with Korean Air, her entry to the Hanoi airport would be considered a multiple entry into Vietnam rather than a transfer.  As I had arranged only for a single entry visa for Vietnam, I was very worried.  I called the Vietnam Airlines office in Siem Reap and a wonderful man with good english advised that he could link the tickets between Vietnam Airlines and Korean Airlines, so that the luggage would be checked straight through, she would be a transit passenger, and our visa problem would be solved!  Sure enough, when she arrived at the airport minutes later the arrangements had already been made, and she was given boarding passes all the way back to the US.  I wish I had gotten the man’s name, he was a hero!  Not only did he fully understand our problem, he thought of and implemented a solution.  Hats off to Vietnam Airlines!!!!!"
862,jjw1969,5,It's the second time I flew this route with Vietnam Airlines this year and the service on board has been consistently good. Flight left and arrived on time. Nice food and variety of options available. The wine they serve with the meal is good. Two seats on each side of the aisle configuration in business class. The seats are wide and comfortable. Great experience. Will fly them again.
862,crazyguide,4,"Always amazed by the meal in Economy class at VN and the very gentle and nice service onboard...<br><br>OK organization is not always 1st class and the bus is a little bit of a pain... but on arrival with the new airport, Vietnam remain one of the easiest destination, especially with an on time flight!<br><br>Only limit is the lounge in HK, whereas in Hanoi - outside a poor internet - the service is really nice too."
862,Charlotte C,4,"With our Jetstar cancellation, we were rebooked last minute (30 minutes before boarding) on Vietnam Airlines and were VERY pleased. We were on a brand new 787, the staff was very accommodating and friendly from the moment we got our tickets. During boarding, the gate crew allowed us to go in the Business line with our 2 young children, which was nice. The plane was new and beautiful - new window shading, in-flight entertainment contained movies, tv shows, kid friendly games and movies. The attendants were very professional and pleasant. Everything was onetime and efficient from checking in to gathering our bags in Hanoi. This was our first time on Vietnam Airlines, so the experience was better than expectations. The only mark I would give them would be the snack which included a simple ham sandwich with a dab of coleslaw, rice pudding and a bag of mixed nuts. Not super appetizing. It was only a 2 hour flight, so not a big deal. We were just happy to get to Hanoi and ride on a fantastic plane."
862,Robert L,5,"I have not flown with a better airline. The service &amp; food were excellent. Admittedly the aircraft from Sydney to Hi Chi Min city was a little dated, but was spotlessly clean &amp; comfortable. The aircraft from Ho Chi Min to Paris was modern &amp; had fully flat lay down beds. I'll definitely fly this airline again. I think some of the larger carriers should take a flight on Vietnam airlines to see how it's done."
862,Harryg1989,1,"These scam artists prey on those who book with Vietnam Airlines online that aren't aware of the visa requirements for a stop-over. They made my flight stop twice in Vietnam in order to classify it as a domestic flight, so unaware of the visa requirements I was hit with a $300 on the spot visa at Sydney Airport, followed by a $90 stamp and photo at HCM city airport in Vietnam. The scammers at HCM threw random prices at other ripped off customers telling them its $90, $120 or even $160 for the stamp and photo. <br><br>To make matters worse, the airline lost my baggage en route to London via one of their pointless/scammy stop overs in Vietnam. Following up on my bag was a lost cause and I havent heard back since - disgusting customer service.<br><br>The in flight entertainment was primitive and hopeless, the staff at the airport and on flight were rude and had a chip on their shoulder for some reason too.<br><br>Ill never be flying or recommending Vietnam Airlines again. Scam Airlines that knowingly make 2 stop overs in vietnam for the SOLE PURPOSE of ripping off travellers with a mandatory visa."
863,JerseyLB,4,"We flu for HK to Hanoi with Vietnam Airline in Business Class and we had a great time, very surprise too by the quality of service. The staffs were very friendly and professional, and served a nice lunch included a glass of wine.The seats were 2 x 2 in Business, witsh give you more space for your legs. When we arrived we had a separate minibus for Club passengers and we went directly to the passport control, very efficient. I am a BA Executive Gold and was amazed withe service. Definitely use it again."
863,carmeltspicer,1,Our experience was horrible. Our entertainment systems didn't work at all and the staff couldn't care less. My screen just kept blinking all the time and it couldn't be turned off at all. Eventually I was moved to another seat where it did work and it was then that I realised that it was an antiquated system based on timed start. Then there were the filthy toilets and horrible food and apathetic staff. Don't they realise that if we don't fly with them then their jobs could be at stake. I have travelled a great deal but never again will I use Vietnam Airlines.
863,Michael K,4,"I live in Vietnam and travel a lot internally. Our company policy is to use Vietnam airlines. Domestically I think they are very average with many flights delayed and I was concerned about the same when I recently used them on an international flight. My experience on international was great. I did 2 return trips from Hanoi to Paris within a month and every leg of the journey was on time, the food was very good, the staff very helpful, the plane was new and very comfortable. I am travelling to Shangai next month using Vietnam airlines and hope the service is just as good."
863,Emma C,4,"Made a few short journeys with them: Hanoi to Siem Reap, Siem Reap to Da Nang and Da Nang to Hanoi. <br><br>All the flights left on time or early than scheduled and landed early...never experienced that before. <br><br>The seats were comfortable with plenty of room. The refreshments served were pretty good and the service was friendly and welcoming (quite different to my long haul experience).<br><br>Would definitely use them again for short flights."
863,Emma C,2,"This was my first flight with Vietnam Airlines and I had high hopes, but to be honest, it was a disappointment. <br><br>The flight left a bit late as boarding was a bit of a state...no order or control. The seats in economy on this aircraft (Boeing 787 Dreamliner) were very cramped from a width point of view...window seats usually offer a bit more room...but not on here. <br><br>The plane was hot. The service was quite poor (I had to wait for 40 mins before anyone acknowledged my cabin crew call light on...broken earphones...in the end I just caught the attention of one of the crew as they were hurrying past). The cabin supervisor was really stroppy...no smiles...clearly not having a good day. The food (I chose the Asian option) was cold and tasteless (the bread rolls were so hard they could be used as weapons).<br><br>On landing (on time), we were not attached to a jet way...which isn't usually a problem, but the stairs didn't seem to fit the plane well as there was a big drop from the aircraft to the top of the stairs...anyone with mobility issues would've had problems. <br><br>And then a long wait for baggage...45 mins standing around the carousel.<br><br>To be honest, if I have a choice, I won't use them again for long haul (pretty good for internal flights though)."
864,EddeeDy,3,"3 hours flight with no entertainment, with a meal that is edible. You can't ask for more right? Anyways, the airline is clean, the seats are comfortable, the cabin crew seemed to be working hard. I guessed, since I'm paying for a flight, I do want to have a 'service' to go along with it. Like accessible of cold drinks and hot drinks throughout the flight. Oh wells. I guessed you can't ask for much for a 3 hours flight. Like accessibility of water and snacks. LOL."
864,Karl V,5,Had multiple flights within Vietnam.  We had no issues on any of our flights.  One weather delay.  Service was very good.  All ticket counters spoke English.  Short lines at security.
864,Kellytbear,5,"For such a long flight time out to Myanmar and back we used business class because of mobility problems and it was worth the extra expense. I had plenty of legroom and the bed/seat conversion created a comfortable flat bed., We arrived remarkably fresh<br>Check-in was quick. All the staff were smiling and helpful.<br>The cabin crew were extremely attentive and the food was as good as any we have had - plus a good selection of wine and spirits.<br>This was probably the best flight we have ever experienced.<br>Some of our group flew economy and they all said how good the flight had been.<br>The aircraft was a new Dreamliner - beautiful."
864,Ajgconc,2,"A bit disappointing.  There were 6 time changes for our flights between Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang before we had even left home. This got confusing in the end.  <br> We flew Melboure-Ho Chi Minh, HCM-DaNang, DaNang - HCM and HCM-Melbourne.  9 flight changes in total.  Not to mention gate changes at the last minute.  But they couldn't trick us, we were on to it!!! Also check in is very very slow in Vietnam. The planes to and from Melbourne were old and both planes (not the same plane) had toilets out of order.   There are never enough toilets anyway, but to have one out of order is not good with so many people. Also on both flights we had to move seats as the entertainment systems were not working.  The planes to and from DaNang were great, no complaints here a short flight so no entertainment or snack but they do hand out water.  The staff on all flights were wonderful, helpful and friendly.  The food from Melbourne to HCM was great, but the food from HCM to Melbourne was not so great.  Vietnam Airlines are apparently the 3rd most improved airline in the world, I believe they still have a little way to go!!!!"
864,ginger c,4,VN airlines has really improved this year.  The new planes have lots of leg room.  The staff are very friendly.  I wish they would serve fried lotus seeds instead of bread as I can't eat carbs.  Being able to check in online and get your boarding pass has made business travel much easier.  Keep up the great changes.
865,lovebali2,5,"for a short flight it was very enjoyable. the flight crew were very helpful, and told us where to visit. very good."
865,Steve A,5,This was my return flight to Vietnam with my family.<br><br>The service onboard by the flight attendants was great and the food was nice.<br><br>Check in was a breeze even though it was a full flight.<br><br>Legroom is standard for this class of travel and all seats had an entertainment screen.  Albeit a little old and quality of choice was limited.<br><br>Our flight was delayed from Sydney and then a major delay from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi.  Made things a little harder as we had a baby with us.
865,Shane S,4,The VN 787 Dreamliner from Frankfurt was excellent! Food was fresh and well presented. The lie flat beds were very comfortable. The in-flight entertainment was the only let down - very limited options. The Boeing-777 to Sydney wasn't quite as good but  adequate. The seats don't go completely flat but the food and service were very good. Considering the price of a business class return to Europe it was pretty good value. One I'd do again.
865,theculinaryedgetv,5,"If you choose to fly domestically in Vietnam it is so easy. We were in Vietnam for our cooking show the Culinary Edge TV and enjoyed flying with Vietnam Airlines. <br><br>I am very tall and for this flight they automatically gave us the emergency exit without us even having to ask! That doesn't happen often. <br><br>Flying around Vietnam, is easy, cheap, and hassle free."
865,VicT7,3,"Not the first time flying to Nha Trang from HCM but the flights were always late with other domestic airlines. It was the the first time i flew with Vietnam Airlines in domestic flight. It was slightly delayed but because of the previous flight. However in the end, we took off and landed pretty much on time. Time management was good. <br>Service-wise, it was standard, nothing too good or too bad. An incident happened on 1 of my flights. The hostess who served the lunch on the flight, for some unknown reasons dropped the whole bag of bread on the floor next to my feet. She quickly cleaned all the bread &amp; dumped them back into the cart where unserved meal trays were.... One last comment on service is the hostess do not smile as often as it should be but somehow showing blank faces especially during pre-landing cabin check. <br>Overall i do recommend it for domestic flights within Vietnam because of the punctioality."
866,Galdana,4,"Flew from Siem Reap Cambodia to Da Nang and Da Nang to Hanoi, both flights were on time, no problems checking in, efficient friendly staff, decent aircraft, so just as good as carriers in Europe and USA. Flights were less than an hour so can't comment on food."
866,D2Z,5,"great airline<br>very helpful staff from the booking till the landing<br>airplane was pretty new and very clean<br>in flight service was great,<br>good entertainment program in the flight<br><br>will defenitly fly with Vietnam airlines again"
866,Darryn,4,"I admit I was a little concerned when I boarded the flight and viewed what appeared to be faded paint on the outside and a very odd  safety video with a fold down screen. It was like something out of the 1980's .<br>But still I cannot argue with the quality of the staff or the food and professionalism of the over all experience. <br>When it comes to heart and customer service their simply fantastic. So good I'm flying with them again in December  2016, so how's that for a recommendation?"
866,SENTHAO,4,I have always used this airlines but i yet to see the flight depart on time once. Most of the time it get delayed and no solutions could be improved to see the timely departure. 8 out of 10 times delays it. Why cant find a solution to it. In Nhatrang airport the gate change even without notification.
866,Andrei L,4,"Solid quality of service. Aircrafts are new, everything went smoothly from check-in to baggage pick-up. Can recommend to anyone at least for local flights, I have not tried international, but I'm sure it should be better =)"
867,SlowlyinAsia,5,"The flight to HaNoi was literally flawless. The only seat I could get was in business class...so for a mere $80 more it was like a private living room...almost. Drinks in hand while still at the airport...wide, comfortable seats, excellent menu choices and very personalized service. The return seemed a little more Wild West-ish...the woman at the head of the escalator was totally indifferent to any requests...her answer... ' have a seat please. ' Next...boarding seemed chaotic...people jumping the queue...one side of the line moving ( hence the queue jumpers ) and one side standing still. Eventually we were bussed to the airplane.  Once on board, it all came together...flight staff was very friendly and accommodating..helpful to a fault.  My seat was deep in economy and I had choice from the lunch menu...drinks were relatively free flowing..as long as you didn't take advantage.  All-in-all..a great roundtrip."
867,Kanku9,2,"I suspect Vietnam Airlines has a policy of holding a high number of second-hand aircrafts in their fleet. I have had several experiences of flying in aircrafts with torn seats, broken video screens, broken audio systems, toilet cupboards being held together by sticky tapes. It may explain why Vietnam Airlines fares are quite low, compared to other airlines.<br><br>The service used to be so terrible, it has slightly improved in recent times.  Vietnam Airlines staff have that attitude problem whereby customers seem to be troubling them, forgetting they are there to serve their customers. This is definitely a training issue.<br><br>With all these negative comments, you may be wondering why we still fly Vietnam Airlines? That 's because they are stopping over in Saigon which allows us to hop out and visit our families before embarking for the next destinations - unfortunately."
867,Wayne W,5,Flying with Vietnam Airlines with SE Asia I have no complaints. It is budget so if a little late at times no big deal. Value for money.
867,Myke C,5,"Using brand new Boeing 787 planes, this was a really comfortable flight. Seat pitch in economy was excellent, and as a 6footer myself I had plenty of leg room. Overhead lockers seemed larger than average, and the cabin air did seem fresher too. The larger windows meant you didn't have to stick your neck to look out. In flight entertainment was excellent, with a huge range of video and films to watch, though you do have to put up with Viet subtitles even when choosing English language films. Crew were friendly and efficient too. Though I had doubts before, I would fly with Vietnam Airlines again!<br><br>Internal flights were on Airbus 321's, and although schedule times were loosely interpreted, the efficiency of boarding meant the planes were loaded far faster than average."
867,cat7455,3,"Vietnam airline is always delay, especially the domestic flight. Delay without former notification, service is ok but difficult to be on time. There is no entertainment on flight."
868,Peter G,5,"Absolutely excellent, great lounges pre-flight, onboard service, comfort and hosties were great, on all flights with this airline. My height is 193cm and no legroom worries best flight ever"
868,Michael N,4,Bulkhead seats in Premium Economy 787 Dreamliner have plenty of leg room and as there are only 2 seats on the outside there is no extra person to disturb. Service is efficient from the crew and the food is OK.<br>The long lay over in Ho Chi Minh City (12 hours) for our onward flight to Sydney is the 'killer' for this route between London and Sydney.
868,YangonPyay,4,"Used Vietnam on several occasions within Vietnam. Planes may be a bit old but you get the old comfort in Business with plush comfortable seats, and hardly ever any fellow passengers. On board service has always been perfect. On ground business lounges are good, well kept and well organised. Check in very easy, embarkation and disembarkation remarkable with seperate minivans for Business (even if only for a few metres!). Worth it"
868,Dragonedin,4,Small plane but good service and comfort.<br>Not a long flight but one that can be affected severely by weather especially at Dien Bien Phu where there is no instrument landing system so only visual approach.<br>Crew always helpful and pleasant on this short journey.
868,Ross B,5,"Another flight and another good experience.<br>The flight was on time and comfortable and more importantly we arrived at Da Nang safely.<br>The views from the plane were spectacular, especially as we passed over the Mekong.<br>Not as cheap as some of the internal flights but a great way if getting from A to B."
869,El Macho,4,"Expected the fight to be like an LCC, but it was a nice plane, nice service, standard airline food. Nothing bad to say about it."
869,DKHNL,4,"Wasn't sure about flying Vietnam Airlines.  Had a short flight from Kuala Lumpur to Hanoi and then from Hanoi to Paris, Charles De Gaulle.  Vietnam Airlines allowed for a stopover in Hanoi which was nice.  As a US citizen a visa is required, so if one is planning a stopover, plan ahead.  There are companies that will arrange for a visa on arrival.  The cost is less than US$20 for their handling.  You print up their letter and take it to the visa on arrival desk with a picture and another $25 fee.  The process at the airport was very easy.<br><br>The short haul flight was fine.  The flight was aboard an Airbus 321.  We were able to move to an exit row that provided more legroom.  Seats were a little narrower than normal because of the tray table being in the armrest, but the added legroom was nice.  Dinner and wine were served about an hour after takeoff.  It was edible.  I found the service to be friendly and efficient.  Entertainment was available.  A Vietnamese show was playing on the screens.<br><br>I had received information from Optiontown about upgrading to premium economy or an ""Empty Seat Option"".  Wasn't sure what it was, but gave it a try.  There was a $3 fee per person to set up an account.  You then place a bid for an upgrade.  We bid US$27 for a row of three seats together.  On the day of departure, I received an email indicating the bid was accepted.  It was the best $30 we spent!  We ended up with two rows of three seats to spread out in.  On a 12 hour, full flight it was nice to have a row of seats to ourselves.  We deliberately sat in the aisle until after meal service before spreading out to sleep.<br><br>The flight to Paris departed Hanoi at 11:55pm and was aboard a brand new Airbus 350.  I was surprised by how quiet the aircraft was.  We were handed menus and headphones for the flight.  There was dinner and breakfast provided and if one wanted, instant noodles were available.  I opted for the fish dinner which was fine and a had a couple of glasses of wine.  Bottles of water were handed out after the dinner service was cleared.  There were tv's on the seat back and I watched a movie with dinner.  There were several western and Vietnamese options as well as television shows.  After dinner, I stretched out and was able to sleep six hours or so.  While not a lay flat bed and what one would find in business class, I have to admit that this was the best rest that I had on a long haul economy class flight.  I was able to more or less lay down with bended knees.  Breakfast was served prior to landing.  The Vietnamese breakfast option was far more tasty than the western option.  Service on the flight was nothing to write home about.  The flight attendants looked ragged by the time we landed in Paris.<br><br>Vietnam Airlines is a member of Skyteam.  I was able to earn miles for the flight with Delta.  The one-way ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Paris with the stopover in Hanoi was excellent.  If needed, I would definitely consider Vietnam Airlines again and take advantage of Optiontown!"
869,atravelingsingle,2,Be prepared for a shock if you are even a couple of kilos overweight on Vietnam Airlines. I was hit with a charge of 880000 Dong for a 4 kilo overcharge at Ho Chi Min airport even though on a previous flight 2 days earlier with the same bags on a Flight from Da Nang to Ho Chi Min. I might also mention no overcharge on a flight from Hanoi to Hue a week earlier. I showed them boarding passes from previous flight and I never bought anything in Saigon it is anew way to further enhance profit. My protests to the gate supervisor were laughed at and it was pay or you don't get onboard and protest more loudly we will call security and you will never fly anywhere again. I paid up but just wanted everybody to be aware
869,Claire D,4,"This airline could not be more of a pleasure to fly with. The seats were a good size and very comfortable. Even though the flight was only an hour we were provided with a refreshment towel and bottle of water. The service was all very efficient and the flight was smooth.<br><br>My one remark was that check in was slightly messy, perhaps this is more the airports fault than the airline though."
869,Richard S,5,"fantastic service , very positive experience ..<br>On a 1,30 hour flight they came with hot towels and offered drinks and had two options regarding food and then coffee /tea with cookie and ones more a hot towel to clean you again.. That is on a 1,30 hour trip.. Europe could learn many things here regarding service.<br>Flight on time.  We will surely be using them again .. just Super !!"
870,Nice_FranceMichel,3,"Air Vietnam is not bad but it still has a long way to go to be able to compete with major International Airlines.<br>Nevertheless, the flight was quite pleasant, and there was no complain about anything.<br>But everything, service, food, confort is average, even in business class."
870,Des B,3,"After booking our flights we choose to pay for an upgrade to deluxe economy through Optiontown, a choice we were really pleased with the flight from Heathrow was excellent really comfortable seats very good food and very attentive service. On the return flight we booked in at Hanoi airport and were issued with our upgraded tickets and made our with through the airport, when we got to the departure gate the staff snatched the tickets off my wife and said they were not valid as there was no deluxe economy section on the plane, when I questioned the staff they became very unhelpful at this point we observed a very drunk man clearly incapable of walking unaided being supported by two men, when I challenged the gate staff saying the drunk passenger should not be allowed to board, they became very agitated and  told us (just get on the plane) and walked away. We boarded the plane only to be followed by the drunk passenger who had vomited on his clothing smelling quite disgusting this really spoiled our return flight. I have contacted Vietnam Airlines since our return and have not received a reply every time I phone them I am passed from one person to another, and then eventually told that they cannot deal with my complaint and that I should contact their Hanoi office, This has been going on since 09/05/16 so if you fly with this airline do not expect to have your complaints dealt with"
870,markr2306,5,We have flown Vietnam air a few times around the SE Asia and have always been pleased with the legroom and space in economy and the friendly helpful service. Would certainly use again
870,SKY0807,4,The flight from Singapore to Vietnam on J class was below average. There was no in-flight entertainment but strangely we were given headsets :)<br><br>The flight from HCMC to Paris on J was superb. This was their new A350. The seats were 180 flat seats at a push of a button (no need to turn it over like in SQ. also no need to slant slightly when you sleep like in SQ). Of course the width was not SQ width but honestly comfortable even for a big guy like me.<br><br>Service was ok but far from the Emirates or SQ standards. What I cannot understand is that Vietnam has plenty of really pretty and smart ladies and yet the selection of crew was really questionable.
870,FordPrefectII,2,"We booked with Vietnam Airlines as we needed to make a stop in Ho Chi Minh City in our Paris - Singapore itinerary, otherwise we would not have chosen to travel with them. Price-wise, the tickets were no cheaper than the other airlines ultimately. <br><br>Safety demonstration was done in a half-hearted manner, I have never seen air stewardesses less interested in the ritual than I am in it.<br><br>The seats in economy were uncomfortably small, even for my 5'0 Asian build. <br><br>Lack of individual screens for in-flight entertainment made it a tremendously boring experience. For French passengers who didn't understand Vietnamese and English, the magazines were also useless.<br><br>The food was ok but the wine was undrinkable and the portions were too miniscule for my partner, who was ravenous hungry.<br><br>Service was appalling; we needed water and had to request 4 times, waited 45 minutes, and was brushed off by the air stewardess each time saying she was busy and will come soon.<br><br>Arriving at SGN airport, we had to step off the plane onto the tarmac, squeeze in a shuttle bus that rolled at 2kph to the terminal as there was no aerobridge.<br><br>I am not giving it a complete 0 because at least we arrived safely in one piece, our baggage were not lost, and we were not overly late. I wouldn't however, choose to fly with them again on economy class."
871,Shazald30,5,Vietnam Airlines were very polite and attentive to make the flight as comfortable as possible and provide to all requirements including my coeliac dietary requirements.
871,Jamal A,4,"Being first timers, we had a smooth experience with transit in HCMC and Hanoi. Good service, 30kg luggage, good flight"
871,Gerrydes1,3,We would certainly never travel with them again.  The plan was worse for wear very tatty.  Very bumpy and uncomfortable ride.  Food was good and the staff were great.
871,rod s,4,Great Airline attentive service good asian food staff.were helpful and the overall experiance was great
871,Sharon J,5,"Great flight, lovely food, spacious leg room yet economy<br>No fuss airline...get on and go!<br>In flight entertainment had enormous choice although not up to date it was great...saw some good films, listened to some great music.<br>The staff were friendly...choice of western or Asian food ...gravy meal or stir fry, alcohol offered with meal only..not during flight...water or a soft drink. This didn't worry us though."
872,Wayne V,4,"In the last 2 years I have flown on 50 trips with VNA. When I first flew it was reasonable quality; but with every passing flight they were improving their service. I now look forward to flying with them. The seats are comfortable, the service is friendly and very good and the food and beverage choices are very good. They are my favourite airline now and I have flown 1st Class Singapore Airlines and 1st Class Cathay."
872,carpBristol,5,"great flight and great service every thing was done for you.The food on the menue was very nice,and the steward were only to happy to get any thing for you"
872,334jack,4,"Although aircraft had seen better days, the flight was generally very good with good cabin service, excellent food and normal business class seats for a short haul flight - unlike most European airlines."
872,Sheri S,4,As a 5'8'' tall American I am accustom to being uncomfortable on airplanes! I was very surprised with all the leg room in economy class. The plane was clean and we were served water and a snack for free! The price was right also!!
872,NgocPhamVan,3,"I am living in Vietnam, so many many times flew with Vietnam airlines for both domestic trip and international trips.<br>I have to confess that, some years ago, service was very bad. Locals call it ""sorry airline"" because often delay with simple word ""sorry"" to customers. <br>However, recently its service has improved. Flights are on time and service is acceptable.<br>Comparison with low fare airlines in Vietnam such as Vietjet air or Jetstar airline, fly with Vietnam airline is better."
873,Chris Moonie,3,"I am a Lotus Miles(frequent flyer) member. <br>I now live in Hoi An and return to Australia 4-5 times a year to work. <br>Since April 2013 I have flown with Vietnam Airlines 40 or 50 + times on domestic and international routes.<br><br>Unfortunately on the international leg I have only two choices which enable me to travel without lengthy layovers;<br>Vietnam Airlines or Cathay Pacific. <br><br>Beacause of the extra 10kg check in I have chosen to fly VNA because extra check in on Cathay is about 5 times the price of VNA. <br><br>In flight meals now are nowhere near as good as what they were when I first started flying with VNA. <br>Most times I'll request vegetarian and on a three occasions have not been able to get one due to VNA mistakes. <br><br>Service is ok without being anything spectacular. <br><br>On international flights to and from Australia VNA are using their old planes and that is very evident in the entertainment system. <br>The number of movies is limited and the system itself is totally inferior to any other airline I have flown with. <br>There is no pause, rewind or fast forward function on the system so movie start times are dictated by the length of the movie and it's not unusual that by the time the system activates on the flight that the movie is 15-30 minutes into its run time. As I said there is no stop and no rewind. <br>It is certainly not at all unusual for the system not to be working at all for any number of seats<br>On my VN773 flight on July 20 two of the three entertainment systems in the row behind me weren't working. <br>On my VN772(daytime flight) on June 20 the two middle rows closest to us had 1 media screen out of the 6 working.&nbsp;Two mums, four young kids and nothing to keep the kids busy with :-(<br><br>What I've outlined here is very similar to an email I sent to VNA on 29/4/16 and which they replied to with a typically corporate blah, blah, blah response."
873,Dale M,4,"Seats were comfortable, crew were helpful and pleasant we used Vietnam for our return flight .... food was good ... inflight movies were limited but there was enough to entertain for the trip ... great luggage allowance ..."
873,NYG50,4,"Domestic flight booked through travel agent based in Sydney, Had some problem finding express check-in at HCM airport asked ground staff given vague answers once check-in found all went smoothly. Went to VIP lounge excellent selection of food and drinks available which were continually replenished. Passenger loading according to rows. Seated in business class section, 16 seats in section only four passengers. Prior to take off offered a hot towel, apple juice and an English language newspaper. Flight departed ten minutes late delay was made up and flight landed in Da Nang on time. In flight meal was a vegetarian pizza and salad, dessert fresh fruit salad.Cabin was serviced by one flight attendant,prior to  landing offered another juice and hot towel,  jet A321. Upon landing given priority departure.<br>Whilst my partner and I were happy with the flight and service offered I feel that the additional money paid for business class would have been better spent elsewhere on the holiday, the flight being so short economy class may have been as good."
873,Maggie O,3,Never again. Too many boxes being loaded by passengers and having to wait too long to pick up your own luggage. Same coming home having to  wait in long queues trying to check in and waiting to take off with plane late waiting for these boxes to be loaded.  Taking off was a nigthtmare for it seamed the plane was  overloaded and struggled to  take off.
873,Kmac1212,5,"Check in is simple and available online. Timetabling is excellent. A change to schedule and I was compensated with free meal voucher in Ho Chi Minh. Staff very helpful, efficient, friendly and English speaking but still with the grace that is characteristic of Asia. Choice of Western or Asian meals. Bathrooms were kept clean throughout the trip.<br>A health incident of one passenger in flight was treated effectively and with great care."
874,Fad A,3,"The airline is part of Skye alliance, and you can get points if you have a loyalty card with any airline with Skye team. <br>The service was efficient, not rude, but not exactly friendly. <br>There were no on flight entertainment or sales. <br>I could not eat the meal, it was pork sandwich, with no other options."
874,Robert L,5,"This flight was everything we could ask for. ..Efficient, clean,  courteous, professional, and most importantly, on time. There was a small basic snack but what can you reasonably expect? Easy check in."
874,Nettanpettan,4,"Very disappointing flight on the way there, we were told we had to fly via Paris, had a 4hr stop over there.<br>When we got on the plane,we were very disappointed to find that our seats were the same as economy, no bigger or more legroom. We were given the premier economy service (real cutlery and premier economy menu but that was the only difference. We had a choice of western or Vietnamese food.<br>We were dreading our return journey from Hanoi to Heathrow, no stop over and almost 12 hrs but we were very pleasantly surprised that we now had the seats and service we had paid for, bigger seats, more legroom with a footrest that comes up when you recline your seats. The seats recline a lot more than the economy ones as well, defiantly worth paying for.<br>Same service and two food options again. <br>Would fly with them again if we actually got what we had paid for!!!!!"
874,Thakrij,5,"The food is excellent whatever the class, but the legroom and seat recline in DeLuxe Economy means that I will always fly this when available in future."
874,Daytripper1on1,4,Pleasantly surprising experience. Terrific inflight service and delicious food. Comfortable seating. Elegant cabin crew uniform.Thoroughly enjoyable experience.
875,Blueye2,4,We flew Vietnam airlines from Melbourne to ho chi min . Flight was on time. Service was fine so was food. Plane was but a full flight so we were able to use the unused seats to lay down and sleep a few hours. We thought flight was good value
875,Sam H,5,"After 3 months of travelling around South East Asia and using nearly every air line, this was one of the best. Very comfortable and the staff were great. I'm 6 ft 3 so I am usually very critical of leg room but the leg room on Vietnam Airlines is superbly spacious. Admittedly, my flight was a short internal hop from one part of Vietnam to another so I cannot comment on food as I didn't get any but overall, very good airline. Would 100% use again. No complaints."
875,ree f,4,"Very friendly efficient service. The plane was spotless, entertainment was up to date and lots of variety. Food was ok. Flight was on time and not full so there was plenty of room to spread out"
875,Thilagavathy J,3,"Reasonable price, good service for a pretty cheap price. The food on board is good. Friendly flight attendant,always offers a pleasant smile. The seat belt slightly shorter compared to other airlines. Offers variety of media collection."
875,Pearler47,4,"Vientiane airport had no information about the late departure. I was wondering when we would go. Airline did well for a flight a little over 1 hour in duration. Unfortunately some people seem to be compelled to drop seats, even on a short flight. Overall efficient and professional."
876,Dutchman888,4,"I would rate VA somewhere between a budget and full service airline. The service isn't attentive, you aren't treated like someone special but which airlines do these days? Get on and get off and if nothing goes wrong in between then you should be happy. Getting from Australia to Vietnam direct is the massive upside. Plenty of legroom, food is good. Had no issues. Will definitely use them again when travelling to Vietnam."
876,Kathryn H,4,"When compared to Chinese Airlines, Vietnam Airlines wins hands down.  Staff were pleasant.  The food a little better than average.  Ground staff were efficient and well mannered.  Planes left on time and arrived on time.  Aircraft were clean.  All in all a pleasant, if not exceptional experience."
876,Christinaz,4,"We made several domestic flights with Vietnam airlines during our trip to Vietnam in August 2015 and we liked their service. I don't know why but I didn't expect the aircraft's condition to be so good, they really had good aircrafts. And we didn't experience delays."
876,toeknee17,4,"Friendly staff from check in to flight. Seats very comfortable, meals good. Overall a great airline who look after their customers."
876,Eyfashionaire,4,"For long haul flight the business class seats are very comfortable. The business class lounge at Hanoi airport was a good experience. Not so much for the business class lounge at HCMC airport, which in my opinion is quite dated and nothing much for the foods/drinks. Boarding at HCMC airport rather disorganized. Hanoi was more orderly. But I think Vietnam airline needs to consider providing more choices for business class meals selection. There are certain dishes (especially starter and desserts) which passengers may not know how to appreciate but alternative is not available. So this is an area that needs improvement."
877,Josh K,4,"First time flying Vietnam Airlines. New Boing, very good service, reasonable food.Bad surprise was waiting more than a hour for the suitcases in Hanoi."
877,Gerda A,4,"For a short flight like mine, a good way to travel cheap.<br>No food or drinks, only a small bottle of water. And for a short flight, that's fine!"
877,65mustangsally,1,"I flew home from a tour on this airline. It was well over an hour checking in, standing in line.  I thought I was lucky getting a seat row to myself, but it was because the table of the seat beside me was broken so they couldn't seat anyone there. When we were loaded, the plane was so hot that people were fanning themselves and obviously uncomfortable with the heat inside the plane. When we took flight it didn't get any cooler. The entertainment system didn't work at all, for the entire flight. The food was cold as there was no power to the heaters,. It was fish or pork, neither of which I eat. When I asked what else they might have I was told ""bread roll"". So I had a bread roll, and later I was given a tiny serve of potato salad, which was warm, from no fridge. I had 2 glasses of white wine, both warm as the fridges were obviously not working. So far so bad! When service was finished the lights were turned off throughout the cabin. However, there were no individual lights so that you could read, especially bad when there was no entertainment system. The call system wasn't working either so you couldn't even call for any cabin crew assistance. I asked the cabin crew leader what was going on and she just shrugged and said ""broken"". I asked her what she would do if there was an emergency on board with no air conditioning, no lights, and also no call system. She just stared at me. I asked her why she allowed the plane to take off with obvious systemic failures on the plane, and asked if she didn't care about her own safety. She continued to stare at me, and without reply eventually stalked off. I had an attempt at the breakfast in the morning. Very little was edible. Then later in the day I had food poisoning symptoms, though I hadn't had any sickness during my entire tour of 3 weeks in Vietnam. Very poor, very dangerous. I wondered what would have happened if we had a sick person onboard during the flight. Would the oxygen have worked ???"
877,DRudd88,4,"The first time I flew Vietnam Airlines they had folding chairs instead of proper seats (this was a LONG time ago). The second time they had used china and flatware from Pan Am. But now, they're an international-standard airline with newish planes and good quality service. The food is passable, and there was a choice of Japanese or Vietnamese. Everyone spoke good English. Cleanliness standards were high. I'd much rather fly with them than with an American airline!"
877,NicolasZaw,3,Flight meal are really nice especially the yoghurt. The flight attendants need to smile and say excuse or apologise when they hit the customer even they are in serving in the plane.
878,Sue W,5,"This was a special holiday for my friends 60th birthday. We started our journey at Heathrow heading off to our first holiday in Asia. Our first flight was to Hanoi in Vietnam. It was our first long haul flight too. Great flight with plenty of films, music etc to occupy us on the 11 hour journey. The staff were all lovely and friendly and believe it or not the flight went much quicker than we expected. We also used Vietnam airlines for 3 internal flights within our 14 night holiday. They were all on time and very comfortable."
878,Mangomanski,4,"Big advantage when flying this route on VN is that they operate it with heavy metal, meaning you'll get a long haul business class product. Flew onboard both the A350 and B787 great flat seats and nice service. Poor food quality, attentive crew.<br><br>Overall recommended. <br><br>Biggest issue with VN SGN-HAN is that the flights are usually delayed since the aircrafts are delayed coming in. Also watch out for flight cancellations.<br><br>No other normal option on this route since VietJwt is even worse."
878,Mangomanski,4,"Flight left on time. I'm a Skyteam elite. Not much recognition, wouldn't give me a front seat, explained that they give it to their Plat only.<br><br>On board service was ok, stewardess barely speak English (apart from Drink or chicken or beef)."
878,reflectionsv37,5,"Without question, this was the most comfortable seat on any flight I've taken in at least 25 years. The aircraft had more legroom than any flight I'v seen in years. I almost wondered if I was in business class or had an exit seat. It was just a regular coach seat.  On top of all the comfortable space, the seat was covered in cloth rather than the typical uncomfortable vinyl so prevalent now.<br><br>The service was excellent, boarding was smooth and efficient and we departed and arrived very close to scheduled times. I also found the cost of an economy ticket to be a great value. I would not hesitate to fly with this airline in the future and would recommend it to anyone!"
878,robinyoung255323,4,"Would never have selected VA, but had no choice as my tour group was travelling all together. However, it was a nice suprise- felt  safe, good was good and plane clean.<br><br>Only complaint was the we saw a group of cabin stewardess sitting at back of plane in service area,finishing off  some bottles of wine, which totally shocked us. I cant see this happening on any airline, as I am sure this would impair their judgment to get us all off if an emergency.<br><br>Seats very small.<br><br>Also flew domestic.... was a good flight, but standards not as good as international.<br><br>I would fly again."
879,Peter T,4,Would definitely fly with this airline again. The stewards were lovely and could not do enough for us. We had a crying baby near us and they took the time to nurse and soothe them to sleep. They also gave us plenty of drinks and kept us very contented.
879,CaseyOng2014,3,"This is a full fledged airline. I am not demanding as I am very used to budget airlines or low cost carriers. <br><br>Firstly, I wonder if the crew knows what 'Overhead Compartment' is for and what safety is. Why? Boxes and luggages were placed on the aisle and the overhead compartment was like, 1/4 empty just because passengers refused to part ways (dude, its just above you!) with their beloved luggages<br><br>Secondly, during the flight, I wondered if the passengers (well, some) are debtors of the aircrew. I mean, hey, smile please and not an expression that simply indicates 'WTH are you doing on this plane!!??<br><br>Thirdly, service on-board the flight was faster than MacDonald's. If they could fling empty cups and plates to you while you catch, I bet they would. And, before you could even take a 4th bite from your meal, they'd come and ask if you have finished? Dude, its just 2 minutes! <br><br>I guess that should be all else I might be awarded 'Best Complainant' by TA<br><br>I believe VA is trying their best so let's hope they get better over time."
879,Alexander R,4,"Best described as ""normal"".  Friendly cabin service,often just a sandwich .<br><br>Nothing to complain about.<br><br>Vietnamese are still learning to travel by air so expect some ""odd"" passenger behaviour."
879,ZVW,4,"VIetnam airlines has been getting some hew equipment in latelyand A350 and B787 are on that list as well. Now finally you have a fully stretchable bed in C class, and that is a serious improvement over the 90's era  777's that ran the service until mid 2015.<br>Staff is helpful and non intrusive (important), leaving you to the night and get a maximum of snooze time."
879,Jan B,5,We have had many flights from Melbourne plus also only travel with them on domestic flights around Vietnam... We have always found them friendly and most of them have a good understanding of the English language....their meals are pretty good to
880,singaroo,4,We flew both international and domestic routes with Vietnam Airlines and found the staff pleasant and helpful and the leg room on board was better than a lot of other airlines. Check in process in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh went smoothly but Danang was a bit chaotic so leave plenty of time to get through.
880,Compass2101,4,No the most spacious seats but everything was fine.  Good food and drink options.  Not problems.  Check in was fine. Good value.  Would use them again if cheap. My parents in their 60's have also had a positive experience in business class.
880,H1CAJ,5,"Completed 'several' flights (approx., 8) with Vietnam Airlines during a recent tour of Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos and while I have 'nothing memorable' to report, I consider this a 'good thing'. All flights were 2-3 hours long and all were 'fine' - no delays, hiccups or issues encountered.........a pleasant surprise as we completed our tightly time-bound tour of this region, without delays or need to change our itinerary!!"
880,jacqueline f,3,"Bit over priced but as the travel agent in Vietnam, the choice of airlines in Vietnam are so limited that the air line can charge what they like. I admit I thought we where going to get something from the Flintstones but I was wrong. They where new airplanes the staff where great and they where a no nonsense carrier. On time all the time."
880,rhbeer,3,"We had  4 flights and all were on time. Our main complaint was on checking in 21/2 hors early we were told we could not sit together. We book business so we don't have hassles like this. It is essential to sit together on a long flight and  should be a given. After making a big fuss we were given a seat that had been taken out of service for a defect. The staff were pleasant, the seat small and not a flat seat and because of the timing of meals there was only 4hours to sleep if it was possible on the very uncomfortable bed. A smooth flight, on time, not cheap, but most uncomfortable.."
881,Beata_Saigon,4,"Reliable schedule, good service and safety on board. <br>Entertainment offer is poor though. <br>Good food and drinks offered throughout the flight."
881,NickCollins77,4,"Cheap last minute flights, clean friendly and very efficient at check in, makes Jetstar look very bad!"
881,Adisubrata L,4,"pleasant experience, my first time flying with Vietnam Airlines, the aircraft itself are new and good service from the cabin crew. The bad side is you have no TV to watch, unfortunately for 3 hours flight having TV in aircraft is a necessity"
881,ZubaidahJB,3,Basic  airline for economy class. The flight served halal food on special request by Muslim passengers. The taste and the menu just so so. Not so much choices on inflight movies and the screen is small. The service is average.
881,Meinard V,4,"There was an hour delay for my flight from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh which nearly cost my flight to Da Nang. Nevertheless, the flight is comfortable, friendly staff, and tasty meals on board."
882,Lynne B,3,"The meals were so late being collected my seat was so loose the seat would tilt when moving to try sleep. Not impressed at all, also a lot of people couldn't watch the tv not working. Not impressed 😡"
882,Warby,4,"Travel this route frequently. Comfortable and always on time. Great selection of flight times, friendly staff and food okay. Flights are rarely full"
882,raymond169,4,We found this airline to be better than Jetstar but leg room could have been  greater and they could have provided better European food choices. Staff were friendly and helpful and the aircraft was a newer one.We would be happy to fly with this airline again.
882,RJS_9,3,"Check in at HCM was laborious and slow, although we were given an exit row seat which made the overnight flight much more comfortable.<br>On this return flight, the seats seemed to be more comfortable, however the in- flight entertainment was the same as the flight going over, so having just about exhausted my choices there wasn't much to watch.<br>Food coming back was considerably worse than the food going over - some of the worst airline food I've had.<br>Flight left 15 minutes late, but arrived 10 minutes early."
882,Stephen C,4,"We've flown both Economy and Business Class with Vietnam Airlines and enjoyed both experiences. The cabins were clean, food reasonable, the planes modern and service attentive. Recommend taking a book because the in flight films are limited, unless you enjoy nostalgic propaganda films where plucky young village heroines swap ploughs for an AK47 to protect the motherland against the hated imperialist etc etc.<br><br>Domestically, the service, food, comfort and so on are fine, but there's a massive problem with delays of three to four hours very common. Worse, this seems a systemic problem so there's no real attempt to update passengers on what's happening or explanation when you finally board. On a personal level, you remind yourself that you are on holiday and that it doesn't really matter if you are late, unless you have an interconnecting flight, but Vietnam Airlines really needs to step up to the plate as the country certainly needs the tourist trade. Excuses that this is a relatively poor and developing country can only take a nation so far. <br><br>This said, providing you realise the domestic system is woeful in timekeeping, I would endorse travelling with this airline."
883,RJS_9,3,"On line check in is not available in Australia, so made sure we had plenty of time to check in. Got to the airport around 3 hours beforehand and managed to get two good seats on the side ( row 8 from memory).<br>Flight left on time and arrived on time. <br>On board, the plane looked a bit tired and the seats were bum-numbingly hard. In flight entertainment was sufficient to keep me occupied, however the material available was pretty basic and no new movies were offered. <br>Service was perfunctory and the flight attendants were pleasant, but that was about it. Meals were ok but not memorable and there were limited offerings from the bar. Between meals there was very little service, although if you requested something it would arrive quickly and with a smile.<br>On arrival at HCMC we supposedly had a three hour transfer, however, this evolved into a five hour stopover due to the late arrival of the aircraft.<br>To sum up: there are better airlines and plenty worse. With Vietnam Airlines you pretty much get what you pay for - so no real complaints, they are a notch above budget airlines and I would say a three star airline."
883,Chris T H,3,"Not an excellent service but enough basic features. Friendly staff and convenient on board services. Cheap price. But as mentioned above, you got what you paid for."
883,Lukas Nguyen,3,"I am a member of Golden Lotus and fly at least 3 times a year with VNA with international flight. The chances that you are getting nice smile, nice attendants and good service are based on the destination you are flying to. If you are flying locally, the chances that you get big nice smile for welcoming is not very high, but if you are flying to EU or other developed countries then it is quite different. The food is just so so, not so great."
883,janenguyen1991,3,"On flight food was great, seat was a comfy one. Flight was smooth. <br>Except for their flight attendants' attitude and broken English. <br>I mean I would expect more for a National airline."
883,Linamus,3,"I decided one month before Christmas to fly to Seoul on Christmas Day. The only airlines that give me cheap fare is Vietnam Airlines, but I have to transit to Ho Chi Minh for few hours. Well, I decided to grab the ticket and off I go to Seoul one month later. Since it was my first time flying with this airlines and I am flying solo this time, I was more anxious. I was worried whether they would cater for my meal (I ordered Halal meal), I have questions almost on anything on the flight but sadly, almost all my queries went unanswered. Simply because none of the steward/stewardess does not speak English. I think most of them undertstand whatever the passengers are asking but to get them to respond or reply back is almost impossible. I don’t even understand what they are trying to say. I would suggest that being a national carrier for Vietnam, the steward/stewardess should be able to speak in English. The only meals I enjoy is the meal from INC-HCM because it has Halal stamp on it. I am sure they cater for my need i.e Halal meal but when I ask whether it is Halal, they have problem saying yes, so I have problem eating it. Service? Well, I cannot say much because they don’t understand what I am saying."
884,Raj1938,5,"Very comfortable seat,superb inflight service,caring crew.My wife and I flew from Beijing to Hanoi,then to Saigon&amp;on to Siam Reap.Flights were on time,the aircraft was clean and so were the toilets.The Veg meal served on board was good.Better than most other airlines flying this route."
884,lightupthedarkness,2,check and baggage clearance took nearly two hours<br>No in flight entertainment for a 5 hour flight<br>Food was very poor<br>some serious work to be undertaken across a range of services
884,F9915ZYannec,4,"Very pleasantly surprised with the calibre of aircraft and staff on Vietnam Airlines.  On time from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City.  Navigating to the domestic terminal in Ho Chi Minh City is a bit of a confusing mess but that's not entirely Vietnam Airlines fault.  Bad signage and misunderstanding was more the problem.  We had 5 flights with Vietnam Airlines in total, and only 1 flight was delayed.  And yes that was a bit frustrating as there was very little information about the delay, but nothing major. The staff were very pleasant and obliging on every flight. The planes were newish. The meals were so-so. Overall a good experience."
884,Gemmagaines,5,This was my second flight with Vietnam airlines and both times I've been impressed. They left on time and landed on time. The comfort and leg room is normal but the staff were very helpful. It's the only airline which flies direct from HCMC to the UK which makes the journey much shorter and they have planned the flights at very convenient times. Overall highly recommended.
884,bmw740il2015,4,I fly this route regularly . I always by an upgrade and try to select either A350 or 787 . The other planes are nice but these are top class .
885,Thuat Pham,4,"Good service , good food. The rice is highly recommended with a glass of red wine.The souvenirs stores are not good enough, can't find something special for the country. The receptionists are so charming in the pink AO DAI.I highly recommend Vietnam airlines"
885,John P,5,"On time.  Each leg of round trip had full meals, unexpected and pretty good actually.  Flight attendants courteous.  Seats were ""the usual"".  Boarding wasn't too organized, but that's a small thing.  Temperature was fine, smooth flight."
885,Tony A,4,"This was a domestic flight which only took an hour and it was very pleasant. Staff were extremely courteous, plane was comfortable and they had us up and down in no time with minimal fuss. I believe internationally they also have a good reputation. Would most certainly fly with Vietnam Air again.Also flew Vietnam Air on the return leg."
885,the little lady,3,"I chose to go the direct non-stop flight, rather than Qantas to Singapore then change to Vietnam Airlines for Singapore to Ho Chi Minh leg. Only one flight a day, 10.15am Sydney, arrives 4pm HCMC. Return flight 8.30pm HCMC arrives Sydney 8.15am. Check in and boarding was a breeze because of the dedicated business class line. As I was travelling solo they arranged to put me in a window seat on both flights, without anyone next to me. Older plane, seat doesn't fully convert to bed, so I couldn't get comfortable to sleep properly. Meals were plentiful, iPad for movies, standard toiletries pack."
885,kevgayem,4,We were pleasantly surprised that our flight left on time.  Customer service at the check-in was excellent and there were no language problems at all.  Announcements during the journey were both in Vietnamese and English and the cabin crew were friendly.  We were disappointed that the water served on the flight was luke warm and we felt that the buses taking us to the plane were very overcrowded.  We would fly with this airline if we were in this country again.
886,Ian R,4,"Only a short International flight, but very well organised. The plane was comfortable, although tall people my find the leg room a little short, built for Asian travellers. The service both on the ground and in the air was good, the food reasonable for a short flight (one and a half hours)"
886,_ha_buithu,4,"Well, Vietnam Airlines is certainly not the most prestigious one among other Asian big names such as Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines or Korean Air, however, VNA has been improving day by day for higher international aviation standards. With my recent flights from Hanoi to Saigon, to Singapore, Hongkong and Australia, I found the flights quality impressive, from the flight attendance to meals. Nevertheless, many things still need to be standardized such as English speaking skills, ground staff, instructions for connecting flights, especially international ones landed in HCMC then to Hanoi, very confusing to foreigners."
886,Dianne W,5,"I have flown several times with Vietnam Airlines and am always surprised at the high calibre of the staff, the friendliness and the service.  Everything is included in the price and the staff seem to be happy in their job."
886,Bulldog5416,4,We were on an overnight flight where the good service and food was spoiled by an extremely noisy passenger in front of us who was up and down all night and spoke continuously in a very loud voice. The staff were very patient with him but I was not - we had words and he quietened down for a while but then started again. Unfortunately you cannot choose who will be on your flight.
886,Stephanie Hong,5,It was a pleasant long haul flight especially with the seat and legroom. Food was great too and will for sure fly with them again. 10 thumbs up for the 30kg baggage for economy.
887,52Ian47,3,"Not the most comfortable flight, but I think sometimes you get what you pay. Food just ok. service there was none."
887,Mrs W,5,"This was our first time flying with Vietnam Airlines.  Business class was roomy and the service was excellent.  The entertainment had a great selection.  Seats were comfortable and turned into fully flat beds which is great for long haul flights.  The cabin service was excellent staff were attentive, toilets were clean all through the flight.  Could not fault them."
887,fjp4564,3,I have used Vietnam Airlines on several occassions only to fly internally within Vietnam.    I was pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort I experienced travelling on this airline and also the very pleasant in cabin service.    Ground service is poor and also check in service is chaotic.
887,Greg M,2,We actually were on 4 different flight with Vietnam Airlines. The standards are very low. I definitely not fly this airline if I had another choice
887,Franeczka,3,OK airline; arrival/departure on time; decent meal; a glass of wine.... We did not have to take a bus to get to plane from the terminal. Check-in was smooth and took reasonable time.
888,Robbo44Melbourne,4,"Plane from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh was old and tired. All the rest seemed to be very new, including the internal. They all were on time and I would have no problems flying with them again. In fact I will be later this month. Service and food were nothing exceptional but I have no complaints."
888,Tony Shepherd,5,"Excellent Check In, in flight service, a big improvement from a year ago I fly often in Vietnam and VN are improving all the time I still think Economy with just a warm bottle of water could be better"
888,Mark F,4,"As typical cattle class it's a bit cosy but they do their best to make you comfortable with blankets, pillows, seatfront entertainment, drinks and plenty of decent food with a few choices of asian &amp; western - and the service was very good, flight attendants friendly &amp; efficient. Connection at Saigon was a bit confusing without much time available but we just made it - try and leave yourself plenty of time for this with internal connections, otherwise they do the job adequately."
888,DingleyDave,5,"We have flown with many international airlines however Vietnam Airlines are by far the best we have used. The staff are exceptionally helpful, the food is always edible and when required hot. The aeroplanes are very clean and the seating comfortable.  There also seemed to be more leg room than most others."
888,David H,5,Self booked flights to join a Groupon tour. Vietnam Airlines were the cheapest option. The flight provided an early introduction to the grace and friendliness of the Viet people. If you are going to Vietnam then you can't go wrong flying with this National airline.
889,bloody,4,"We chose Vietnam Airlines for the Business class price ($4k) which was half the fare of Emirates/Etihad and to avoid flying through to the Middle East.<br>Our first leg was on a 330 which was a little dated with Premium economy style seats rather than flat beds but still comfortable. Meals and drinks were very good and plentiful and the staff were very professional, friendly and polite. The stopover was a bit of a drag - 6hrs and their lounge at HCMC was very basic and disappointing - improvements need to be made! <br>The 2nd leg to Paris on the new A350 was excellent. New aircraft and flat beds, excellent staff and plenty of service for drinks/ snacks/ meals. Very comfortable flight and slept most of the way.<br>On our return flight the lounge at CDG was operated by Air France and it was excellent with plenty of comfortable space and food/beverage choices. <br>The stopover in HCMC was long - 14hrs! We had applied for VOA and spent the day in the city with a booked 'day stay' at the Caravelle Hotel. Visited a nearby day spa for several hours and rested/showered ready for our flight home.<br>I would recommend Vietnam for those wanting an affordable yet pleasant option for Business Class."
889,L-J J,3,"Basic airline, no frills.  We did several flights within Vietnam, Seating is ok but not that much leg room, although adequate for short haul flights within the country. You get offered a free cup of water and a small packet of peanuts with a refresher towel. That is about it ! Airline was prompt, some planes appeared older than others but they were all clean. We did 4 flights on this airline. Staff were there to do their job, friendly but not gushing with enthusiasm. Cost was reasonable as you would expect in Vietnam."
889,Eva L,2,"I have actually flown with Vietnam Air on several occasions, from Hanoi to Da Nang, Hue, Dong Hoi and to Siem Reap, Cambodia.<br><br>ALL of them were delayed.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is only one or two options when fly in and around Vietnam.<br>In the case of flying from Hanoi to Siem Reap, Cambodia and back, there were five delays in this trip alone, totaling in pushing the flight back several hours, to the point where I nearly missed my flight back to the United States.<br><br>If flying Vietnam Air, leave PLENTY of extra time in your itinerary.... like hours or even an extra day.  It's not uncommon for a flight to be canceled entirely."
889,Sue and Peter H,4,"Great service, only direct flight from Melbourne to Vietnam.  Staff very efficient and well presented.  Speak very good english.  Would recommend this airline for value for money."
889,jan59Essex,3,"We flew Vietnamese Airlines from London to Cambodia via Saigon,  then internal flights to Hanoi, Danang, Saigon with no problems at all. We went to Can Tho, via the Mekong delta and the final leg was from Can Tho to Phu Quok for a restful 5 days at the end of a hectic trip. At 7pm, we were informed by our agent that Vietnam Airlines had altered our 9.30am flight the next day, to 7.30pm because neither flight was fully booked. Great. The resort on Phu Quok was the most expensive part of our stay, and we arrived in time to go to bed. Thank you. <br>Our return flight from Phu Quok to Saigon was also a pigs ear - different time flight, rush to get to the other terminal for International flight home - very amateurish. All correspondence with airlines conveniently delayed until we arrived home.<br>Wouldn't recommend unless staying on mainland."
890,Mitch C,3,"After having great inbound flights with VN, I was expecting a good flight. Not so much. My luggage was overweight, but I couldnt pay my fee at the VN counter at Narita, I had to wait for the Delta counter to open (over an hour). Boarding was fine, and seemed to follow Japanese efficiency. Seemed to leave slightly late, no explanation why. Inflight safety video not played until actually taking off, which I am pretty sure is something that needs to be done prior to takeoff. Wrong menus were handed around. Crew were not too interested, but friendly nonetheless. Food was decent, as expected. Arrived into SGN on time. Nothing special this time around."
890,Mitch C,4,"Left late from SGN. Never told why, but arrived into Tokyo on time, so thats something I guess. Crew were as good as on my last flight. Boarding seemed slow. Was a night flight, so only one meal service prior to arrival into Tokyo, and was quite decent as far a airline breakfast goes. Can't really complain about anything."
890,Mitch C,5,"First time flying with Vietnam Airlines for a trip to Tokyo. Check in was good, despite the systems not working. Boarding was also very well executed. We left on time and arrived into SGN on time. Crew were very good, always smiling, and always present in the cabin. Comparable with airlines like CX in that regard. The seats had good width and pitch, although were like church pews, and become rather uncomfortable after a few hours. The food was great, way better than I was expecting. The IFE was shocking, and was by far the worst aspect of the flight."
890,BevGall,3,Food was good. Service good. But the seats were so uncomfortable. My back was killing me by the time the flight ended. I know it was economy but they really need to improve the comfort. Would consider flying with another airline next time if doing a long flight.
890,Mog11y,4,Really enjoyed the flight. The food is above average and the service is always delivered with a smile. The entertainment system is adequate but is not on demand like a lot of other airlines so you have to wait until the start time to watch. The only problem is that the leg room is not nearly enough if you are average Australian height. Fine for the Vietnamese people (who usually make up at least 50% of all flights I ave been on) but unless Hubby can get an exit row he is cramped the whole way. But the direct flight and cost(and alcohol) does compensate.
891,Carole S,4,"Flew all around Vietnam - 6 flights in all. Each flight was on time and flight was no fuss.  No entertainment on board,  Mostly English pilots flying planes. Service includes a water and a hand towel. No negatives to report. Would use them again. Allow lots of time for check in at Ho Chi Minh international."
891,tony r,4,"The staff are polite and friendlt. Cabin clean and tidy although in need of a update.food fresh and tasty, inflight is comprehensivve enough."
891,steve1068,1,"Check in staff and flight crew rude and unhelpful on both outbound and return flight. The planes are tired looking and for a long haul flight very cramped. The facilities consist of a blanket and headphones that are cheap and don't do the job they should. The food is the worst I have ever been presented with. Vietnam is fabulous but it's airline is a low budget firm pretending to be able to do long haul. I would urge anyone going to Vietnam not to fly with this airline, as stated in the title I will never being doing so again"
891,ScootsBirmingham,4,"Flight was on time and plane appeared fairly new, the crew were helpful and courteous and for a long flight made the journey tolerable<br>Seats were ok and wouldn't hesitate to use them again<br>Also took internal flights, one delay and other two in time as was the return flight"
891,Freddie1955,3,"I approached flying with Vietnam Airlines with some trepidation, having read some very negative press regarding this airline.<br>I would happily fly with them again.  <br>The flight was slightly delayed , but the aircraft (an A320) was modern , clean and in fine condition.  The staff all spoke perfect English (as is the norm in Vietnam where English is taught from age 6).<br>Snacks and soft drinks were served in-flight and the whole experience very pleasant. There is no in-flight entertainment offered."
892,Andrew N,4,Have now flown with VIETNAM Airlines on four separate occasions and have never once had a bad experience. A great way to start a vacation. Starting in the Qantas Business Class Lounge and then experiencing the Friendliness and Warmth of the VIETNAM Airlines Staff during the flight is something that I would recommend to anyone that wants to travel overseas in comfort.<br>Many co-passengers use this same Airline on route too Europe as it is so cost effective. P.S. The Vietnamese Cuisine and French Wines during the flight also helped make these Flights very memorable.
892,Masako P,2,"Our family flight with Vietnam air line to Japan on September. And we stopped over in Hochi Minh city for 2 nights from Melbourne. <br>When we got into the air craft , it was boiling hot inside. They didn't put air conditioner until departure.<br>It was not very comfortable experience in the first , then food was not yummy and very very small size. My 2 teens were starving. <br>Drink choice was very limited.<br><br>My screen was freeze from the beginning, I had to use next sheet one ( luckily it was available )<br><br>It was cheap ticket but I prefer to pay more and get better service and facilities on the flights.<br><br>I'm not going to use this company anymore."
892,Thesh0pper,4,"This was a two stage flight. We flew to HCMC and had a long layover,  before connecting to the Paris flight. The lounge in Sydney is the Sky Team Lou Gehrig - small but clean, well service, with quite a good range of breakfast foods (morning flight).  <br><br>The place across from Sydney was a B777, with very old style business class - basically a recline seat. This is not bad for the day flight but is not so good for the overnight flight we had on our return. In-flight entertainment is very limited - the built-in system isn't used - we received an iPad pre-loaded. Food, beverage and general cabin service was good. The amenities pack was also fine (usual socks, eyeshade, moisturiser, lip balm), slippers are provided. Blanket and pillow provided.<br><br>On arrival at HCMC you are met by a rep, taken to the immigration area where a one-day visa is arranged for you (you need a passport photo). You then are taken to a local hotel (about 2-3 star) to rest. The room was clean, modern, well-presented and you can have dinner if you wish. This is all complimentary.<br><br>The flight to Paris was on a new A350. The seating this time was a pod style, with lay flat bed. This time the in-seat entertainment was used - but restricted range of movies and even more limited TV. Service again was good, food was terrific and good wines chosen. <br><br>In summary, a second tier airline that is excellent value and seriously upping its standard to compete with the first tier airlines. IF the plane to and from Sydney was a modern business class seat/pod there would be little to 'complain' about. Would I fly it again - absolutely and will do so next year for our next holiday."
892,JAKECINCINNATI,4,We were luck enough to be upgraded to First class and the service was fantastic. The plane showed it's age but other than that the crew was flawless.
892,Travnur,4,"This was part of a tour from Hanoi down to Saigon.   However, the infrastructure is not good in the mountainous areas, so we were forced to fly.   Pilot was British, staff efficient, and no turbulence.  No food service on this flight."
893,Mitchell-Family-01,3,"My family and I recently flew with Vietnam Airlines in June/July 2016 from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City and return.  We also travelled on three internal flights which were relatively good.<br><br>International legs - We found the cabin crew service quite good but it was the little things that Vietnam Airlines need to improve on.<br><br>We had an overnight leg on the way home and most decent airlines provide their passengers with night masks and earplugs but not Vietnam Airlines.  So your quality of sleep if any, was poor.  We were down the back of the aircraft and could hear the sounds of the trolleys clanging.  The quailty of the headphones supplied are poor quality and I ended up using my own earbuds so I could hear the movies over the jet engines.  On the way back the games on the inflight entertainment did not work.  And the movies that were offered, we had already seen back home.<br><br>Now the flight into Ho Chi Min........We had to catch a connecting flight to Da Nang some two hours after arriving.  Apart from transiting our bags through, the information provided about how to find the domestic terminal and then the gate area was poor.  Not only were we confused but other passengers also had no idea.  Ho Chi Minh City airport is large and we finally found our way after I approached their desk in the Domestic Terminal to be told we had to go upstairs through the security check and then to the gates.<br><br>Overall the intrenational flights were just ok but as I said the little things could be improved."
893,825Sarah,5,"We had various options to choose from for our round trip, but Vietnam Airlines were recommended and for Economy Plus flights, provided a good cost option.<br>The price was kept low by keeping all of our flights with Vietnam Airlines and we flew; Heathrow- HoChi Minh- Cambodia- HoChi Minh -Singapore- Heathrow<br>Long haul flights were both on board a new Dreamliner which was very smart. Good legroom, entertainment (though many films not in English) Heritage magazine and refreshments - Asian and English choices for all meals. <br>Small plane to Cambodia was however basic, economy grade and was rather cramped and noisy. It was only a short flight and a bottle of water was provided. Inflight brochure 'Angkor' was very interesting and provided further insight as to what we might experience in Cambodia.<br><br>Of all the flights on this trip, we only experienced one delay and whilst always irritating, it  wasn't too long. Staff were always pleasant and helpful and my only real criticism of the Airline would be HoChiMinh-Singapore leg, in which people appeared to take on as much hand luggage as they wished and overhead lockers quickly became full, meaning that we and many others had to have theirs down on the floor. I appreciate that with the increase in both kg &amp; size allowances for hand luggage this can be a regular occurrence, but we haven't experienced anything to this extent. Again, in the scheme of things, a minor irritation. Specific review scores reflect different types/size planes and would be higher if based on long haul/Dreamliner flights.<br><br>Not sure whether this review will be helpful to anyone, but we will certainly travel with Vietnam Airlines again."
893,Classiarii,5,Whatever anyone says about them I paid next to nothing for the flight purchased from the airport it took off and landed without a hitch so what more could you want....got some funny looks putting my rice paddy hat in the overhead locker but all in all thumbs up
893,elderg42,4,"I had just received a new passport and hadn't informed Canberra, the check in staff were fantastic and sorted it all out for me. As far as the flight went we were glad we upgraded with an empty seat between us and bulkhead which gave us plenty of room. Business was full but we got Premium Economy so meals etc were the same as economy but all in all a decent flight"
893,Brian Peterson,5,All trips to Vietnam were with Vietnam Airlines and I can not fault this airline.<br>Highly recommended.
894,Grey_hairLenhamUK,5,"We flew to Da Nang via Hanoi and Back via Ho Chi Minh City. My wife hates flying so we were a bit concerned as this was our first time with Vietnam Airlines. We had no need to worry. The seats were large and comfortable, the cabin crew were all young, polite and nothing was too much trouble. Everything was free, you could get snacks at any time, day or night. It was an absolute delight to find an airline that actually put the customers first. This we found to be a general trend with the Vietnamese people.<br>The only down side is that they have moved their operation from Gatwick to Heathrow and we hate Heathrow so we probably won't be using them again but it is very refreshing to know that it is possible to run an efficient and friendly airline that puts customers first."
894,Annmarie B,3,"flight on time from LHR, good service/check in/lounge, comfortabe flight and good in flight services.<br>Ho Chi Minh to Cambodia - good service/short flight and economy seating satisfactory.<br>Cambodia to Hoi An - good check in, very poor in flight service, bags damaged (however, we didn't notice until we got to our hotel, no recompense as is with other airlines)<br>Hoi An to Hanoi - extremely poor/disorganised check in. poor directions, average flight service.<br>Hanoi to LHR -poor lounge facilities, slow check in, average service, comfortable seats on Dreamliner.<br>Having collected over 23.000 Lotusmiles, we have tried on many occasions to redeem for flights, however, the only office they have in UK is in London and they insist you have to come 'in person' to collect tickets, no online facility for UK residents, come on Vietnam Airlines, you are pushing your UK routes and Frequent Flyer programme, surely you can do an 'e booking/ticketing service' for mile redemption and award flights, even with your airline partners..... would be reluctant to book with them again."
894,travels46,4,"The in-flight service was very good, and the aircraft clean and comfortable. The cabin crew was friendly and attentive."
894,Carolinatravellover,5,"This is truly an amazing airline. I was a bit doubtful about flying with Vietnam Airlines, as I thought that perhaps (in my ignorance) that they were a shabby, third-world country airline, with old planes etc. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>The seats in economy are far more spacious than most economy cabins, with comfortable reclining angles and a generous width to allow you to be comfortable. <br>The food was very good, nicely presented and very tasty. The service is quite excellent. And the 787 Dreamliner we flew on was whisper quiet. Turbulence seems to be kept to a minimum, when you do encounter it, due to the size and stability of the plane. I felt like I had glided on a magic carpet all the way to London!<br><br>Overall, the crew and cabin crew were exceptionally professional, and the ground staff are also efficient and helpful. Boarding for the flight, and exiting the plane were both executed very quickly and effortlessly. <br><br>I would not hesitate to fly with Vietnam Airlines again. In my opinion, they are right up there with Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Air New Zealand - all favourite airlines of mine. I highly recommend them."
894,Mikedel007,5,I upgraded to business and it was easy and very cheap.  The flight was fairly short but I can say the service and comfortableness was very good.
895,On the road,4,"new airplan Boing 787, comfortable sit, foods ok, entertaiment pure, staffs sometime not too friendly, rest room not clean all time"
895,Andy S,3,"Cover all the flights we took - Saigon-Siem Reap-Hanoi-Hue-Danang-Saigon.<br><br>All OK, fairly comfy. Bottled water on flight, sandwich on the flight into Hanoi was OK.<br><br>Modern planes and European flight crew, and local cabin crew were all good. Flight left/arrived on time and nothing was lost!"
895,TJA950,4,"I had heard some very bad reports about this airline and how tired and old their planes were, how offhand the crew were and how bad the food. I believe they updated their fleet at the start of 2015 with brand new aircraft. We found the service to be excellent, the food very good (for airlines) and the flight very comfortable indeed. The crew were pleasant, helpful and the experience was far better than I expected. If all their planes are like the one we had, then I highly recommend them to you and I will certainly fly with them again if the opportunity arises. The only downside was that the films were pretty poor."
895,Richard N,1,"Flew Premium Economy - as wife disabled; flight from London 4 hours late - missed connecting flight.  Next flight (to Cambodia) was late - as was the one coming back.  Flight to Hanoi to connect with London flight was brought forward - only found out when checking in on-line.  Flight to London was also late.  Airline refused to acknowledge - let alone reply to - my 5 emails of complaint.  Appalling would be too good a description - would never fly with them again, especially as their airmiles programme (Lotus) has been hacked and passengers details compromised!!  Oh - and the armrest going to Hanoi fell off - was told to stick it back with duct tape!  Couldn't get any worse if it tried."
895,Charles S,4,"Got bumped to business class and enjoyed it tremendously. I has ample leg room, ate some wonderful food and enjoyed the complimentary drinks. The fligjt attendants wear bright and very colorful uniforms and all are very young and attractive. <br><br>The donwside was that my luggage came in full of a gel soap that leaked from the lavatory or some other container in the belly of the plane. I had no time to complain so I moved on and the soap dried up without causing any stains."
896,pom1972,2,"I'm 6ft, my husband is 6ft8, so if an airline doesn't have a Premium Economy cabin we don't fly with them, it's just not worth the stress of having to fight for an exit row. So we were really excited to find out we could fly in premium with Vietname airlines. Their online checkin wouldn't work on either of our tablets (neither ipad nor android) so we went to the airport early only for the checkin person to go very quiet and then say she was just getting her colleague/manager. Who eventually turned up and told us that they'd changed the plane (still a dreamliner but for some reason with a totally different layout to the rest of their fleet?), no longer had a premium cabin and were downgrading everyone to economy, but we shouldn't worry because they were allocating 3 seats to every couple to give them more space (sorry that doesn't work if your legs don't actually fit in front of the seats in front). Lucky we were there early enough that when we kicked up a fuss about how this wasn't going to work they managed to switch us to the bulkhead row and we at least didn't have to worry about crushed kneecaps, but we were incredibly stressed by the time we boarded as to what we'd face. Given no real info either, just some very vague letter and instructions to go back to our agent to get compensation.<br>To add insult to injury they have a really weird drinks policy - I'm not someone to drink heavily on flights but after that stress I really wanted a G&amp;T - the attendant seemed determined to make a minature bottle of gin stretch between 3 people - after the person behind me and I both complained she gave us the rest of the bottle between the two of us ! (yet my husband was allowed to have a whole bottle of whisky). Wine with the meal wasn't much more than a dribble in the bottom of a smaller than usual glass. <br><br>On the plus side the food was lovely, and when we eventually got our premium seats on the way home (but they didn't manage to seat us together) they were really comfy. <br><br>Oh and as for the compensation? We submitted the docs by email to our agent before we even got on the plane so he could set things in motion - it still took five months before they paid up, and they clearly paid the bare minimum they could get away with.<br><br>Whilst I never say never, I would have to hear a LOT of good things about them from a LOT of people to ever consider flying with them again"
896,ladybirdseahorse,5,"We booked premium economy and expected just a slightly bigger seat, but but were delighted when we found that the seats were almost flat beds. That were so comfortable that we both slept for around 6 hours - amazing as I never sleep on flights and usually only nap. <br>We were also given slippers which was great as I like to take my shoes off and usually go barefoot but have to put shoes back on to go to the loo, having slippers meant I didn't have to mess around trying to get my swollen feet into shoes!<br>Food was fine - no complaints there. <br>Flights were all on time."
896,richml,1,We flew to Vietnam and then onto Cambodia (utilising 7 flights) &amp; return with Vietnam airlines. In my extensive world-wide experience this airline is by far the worst I have ever used. Every flight was delayed - not one single flight took-off or landed on time. We flew Premium Class - but you would never know it. The seat material was shabby and dirty. The food was ordinarily plain and totally bland. The cabin staff were mediocre to say the least. I wrote to the London office but of course received no reply. An extremely unsatisfactory experience with what must surely be one of the world's worst airlines. Your choice but I would never ever use them again.
896,Janita B,5,"Efficient, professional, friendly, on time, good food,  good wines.   The seating was excellent, comfortable, good films, own  screen"
896,jerryschriewer,5,"In July, we flew from Ho Chi Minh to Da Lat city on Vietnam airlines. The check-in counter was very quick. The attendants on the flight were very friendly. Definitely recommend this carrier to any one traveling in Vietnam."
897,Ben W,4,"Vietnam Airline is my favourite carrier in Vietnam. Booking, checking, boarding, service on board and anything else goes usually smooth."
897,Belgo96,4,"Quite pleased with the service of Vietnam Airlines. Flight was on time (as per all my five inter Vietnam flight sectors with this airline), smooth and easy airport check in service. Flight had a small snack and beverage. Absolutely nothing to compliant about with Vietnam Airlines."
897,Dee C,2,The flight to Saigon from Melbourne was great.  Left on time and arrived on time.  Nice staff - better than expected.<br><br>Then pretty much down hill - connecting flight to Hanoi very confusing no real direction but we worked it out.   2 other domestic flights this trip one delayed apparently they had changed the times days before - no notification to us.  The other flight was ok.<br><br>The flight from Saigon to Melb was a complete disaster.   Delayed 2.5 hours - no warning or explanation.  Then further delays at the gate no communication.  Boarding was weird - it was mayhem.   Then an incident (illness) in flight and the staff had no idea.   Scary.   Luckily public on board were qualified to take over.   Of course the incident was not the fault of the airline but it was so apparent they had no idea how to handle it.  <br><br>For domestic flights this airline was ok for international I would avoid at all costs.
897,ultravist,2,"I fly with VN 311 on 23th July 2016, my seat is 42H. Every thing is not good but not bad. Only meal service from one flight attendant that I can't accept. The very shot hair male crew look older than other ask would meal I want, weatern (beef) or japanese(pork).<br>Japanese is my choice cause i don't like beef but he serve beef to me without anyword. When i see beef i find him but he has gone. I ask other crew, and find out pork is out of stock. It's acceptable the if you seat is  in back area you might have no choice of meal but why he offer me two choice and serve me the meal that i don't want with out apologize. I complain this point to the airline webside but there is no response."
897,loutwin2,4,"We were booked onto a Vietnam airlines flight with a connecting flight at Singapore with Jetstar. Unfortunately, Vietnam airlines were late leaving Hanoi which made us extremely unlikely to make our connecting flight in Singapore. My family and I raced off the Vietnam plane once it touched down in Singapore, straight into a Jetstar team member holding a plaque with our names on it! The lovely staff from Vietnam airlines had rang Jetstar to let them know of our situation who then whisked us away in an airport car to ensure we caught our connecting flight. We made it and so did our baggage. Very impressed with Vietnam air for taking that extra step in customer service!"
898,Lubilooo,5,"The Dreamliner 787 is the mother of all planes! Never mind the A380 - this was seriously one of the most comfortable, enjoyable flights I have taken (and I take a many). The larger window size, the mood lighting, the reclining seats and the comfort of those seats - well, I say - marvellous! I was in heaven :)"
898,Tonyjann,5,"Plane was late by 1 hour leaving Sydney , did not pose a problem as connecting flight in hochiminh city was held back. I thought this was great. Staff were good and pleseant . Food and beverage great on way to Vietnam. Food not so good coming home from Vietnam . Movies on board were old and played on a rotating basis at set times. Plane was getting old. Has more positives than negatives- direct flight to Vietnam , staff were great, food on way was great."
898,Julie H,4,Vietnam Airlines are the best airline to fly in Vietnam.  I find them more reliable that other airlines and they have good times and destinations.
898,JAJAYtravellers,4,"Was a little uncertain about this airline, however during our journey to and around Vietnam each trip was comfortable even with the expected turbulance around the tropics. Service was very good and we had no issues with check-in, boarding or departure. Would travel again without hesitation."
898,10richardv,4,"We had our first A350 flight with Vietnam Airlines recently, sitting in the two middle seats of Row 1, in Business Class.  The food was first rate, the crew helpful, and the new aircraft extremely comfortable.  Best of all, we arrived in Hanoi well before the scheduled arrival time, our luggage was delivered very quickly, and we were on our way to our hotel in record time.  This flight was going on to Paris, and we would have been more than happy to use this service to Paris.  Highly recommended."
899,Thexprt7,2,"This was my first time flying Vietnam Airlines and I will try to avoid ever doing it again.  While I can appreciate the fact that this is the local country airline, the customer service and do not care attitude was prevalent on the ground.  Just trying to check in and check our bags was a long and painful task.  Long waits in line, little to no instruction or direction on how or where to proceed and complete unorganization.  I would avoid flying this airline if possible."
899,Vince Huynh,4,"I have always flight with Vietnam Airline when I go to Saigon (yes it's HoChiMinh city but every one prefer to call it Saigon) and now with the new aircraft Boeing 787 the experience is much better. Seat widths and leg space is good. Check in luggage is a good 30KG allowance per person plus you still can carry 7KG hand luggage. <br>The best is Vietnam airline price is still the cheapest - direct flight, compared to other airlines (which more expensive and not have direct flight)<br>The food on the plane is good although sometimes if you sit at the back you might not have much choice of food left. If you still hungry after your meal, you could always ask for a sandwich or 2 minutes noodles. <br>The new style of seat on economy class does feel comfortable. <br>There is inflight wifi which offer very good value"
899,Valerie,4,"We booked all our flights on line with Vietnam Airlines.  We were in Premium Economy from London to Ho Chi Minh.  it was nice to have the extra room on such a long flights.  Attentive staff on Board.  All our internal flights were also very good, effective from checking to collection of luggage.  I am impressed."
899,Barry B,3,"Check-in average on way out but chaotic and disorganised for return flight. Given conflicting advice on where to queue, no destination indicator above check-in counter and sullen staff. Flight was technically quite good and row 46 has good leg room in seats D, E and G. Inconsistent in-flight service, no on-demand movies but generous with alcohol."
899,Wufang,4,"What a surprise to find ultra modern airports, friendly check in and security staff,<br>clean and comfortable waiting rooms and on time departure and friendly in flight staff and service. So relax fellow travellers and bury your travel anxieties, you will be pleasantly surprised of this airline and the lovely country and its friendly people"
900,Hoàng Nhân L,5,"I have a great moment with Vietnam Airlines, the plan was not big plan, I think its Airbus  A321. However, the services made me surprise, I also like about the food, very tastety."
900,bacidog101,5,"after a few days in Siem Reap , I picked up a vietnam Airlines flight to ho Chi minh , and to my surprise , the whole experience was fantastic. From the check in to boarding, onto a very modern Jet , assisted by lovely Viet airhostess, and guys stewards ,not a thing was out of place or too much trouble for the crew to make to flight prep smooth and easy.<br>The flight was smooth ( yes ,thats the weather ) but the meal served was a nice vietnamese dish , with nothing too hot or spicy ( I love both , but not all the travellers would )<br>on arrival into HCM, everything was smooth and easy deplaning . It was funny after such a nice trip , I arrived refreshed and looking forward to the sights and food delights of HCM , and I was not disappointed."
900,Tezin-Gyalpo,4,"Vietnam has 3 major airlines services: Vietnam Airlines (VNA), Viet Jet (VJ), Jet Star(JS). These 3 airlines cover major destinations in Vietnam<br>VNA is the most expensive ticket and also have the best service among 3 companies. VNA has more facilities although it shares same infrastructure in airports with others. VNA can change ticket if you are late or miss time since they have more flights in same routes.<br>at the last minute ticket, VNA has cheapest price among 3. VJ and JS when you want to buy last minute ticket can charge you 1,2 or even double price higher then normal while VNA keep it normal, so it makes last-minutes-ticker of VNA cheaper<br>English speaking staff in VNA also better among 3"
900,Jamulguy,5,"I was really surprised with how good this airline was. Newer plane, great looking flight attendants, full meal even on a short flight.  Will travel with them again."
900,BrockDaBadger,4,I paid US $32.65 each way for both my flights from Ho Chi Minh City to Hue and from Hue to Hanoi.  We had to take a bus from the gate to the plane and then climb one of two stairs into the plane.  Boarding was like US regional airports in the 1960s and 1970s before gangways became common .  Vietnam Airlines was efficient and courteous; quickly handing out a bottle of water to every passenger for this very short flight.  No IFE.  Very good compared to US airlines.
901,JohnWithoutCarol,1,"I have just flown return from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City with Vietnam Airlines and I am compelled to write about this experience as I have flown a lot of airlines and a lot of routes throughout my life but this, without a doubt was the worst flying experience of my life. I don't know if it's because Vietnam Airlines has a monopoly on this route but I can say that this airline has no interest at all in providing any sort of half decent service or level of comfort to passengers that is generally accepted as standard on modern airlines in this day and age. Firstly the plane was really really old and obviously showed its age, everything about it was tatty from the sagging upholstery to the crumpled inflight magazines haphazardly hanging out of virtually unserviceable seat pockets. My seat would not stay reclined and as soon as I sat up to try and get comfortable (pretty much impossible anyway) the seat promptly returned to an upright position. The entertainment system was a debacle. Despite receiving headphones on both sectors, my partner and I at no point were able to get the system to work on either flight, and in fact the whole of both flights, the sporadic inoperable entertainment system served to annoy and frustrate to a point that it just became a big joke. The leg home was worse as my system decided to flash a white screen at me on and off for the entire trip. It wasn't something you could turn off, you just had to cover it with something to try and prevent yourself having an epileptic fit. But passengers incredibly just generally seemed to accept that this is just how things are on Vietnam airlines and just generally resigned themselves to not using the entertainment system for the duration of the flight and as far as I could tell, no one complained to the crew. I was completely gob smacked, no other modern airline would deem this acceptable. The food was absolutely awful, really bland, no desire to impress or add some cultural relevance with the menu. The main dishes were really salty and mostly went uneaten. Even a simple orange juice was like a warm syrupy cordial and could not be swallowed. Throughout the flight the climate control cyclically heated you to a point of sweating followed by cooling you to a point of freezing. We were constantly putting on and then taking off layers of clothing. The crew are unsmiling, abrupt and even rude. No one to give you a smile and wish you well as you disembark. <br><br>I don't understand why if I have taken two flights with pretty much the same poor level of service on both, that this airline is getting any sort of good review from anyone. I can only think that they think they have this particular route sewn up and they can do what they want and treat passengers in such an appalling fashion. Indeed, both flights were full. Well I can tell you I will NEVER fly them again and I appeal to Qantas or Virgin or others to introduce competition on this route so that Vietnam Airlines cannot continue to show utter disregard to its passengers and treat us like fools.<br><br>Do not fly this airline! I would give them minus stars if I could!"
901,Tom M,2,"Firstly, we couldn't check in online so ended up with pretty terrible seats. The entertainment system is from the dark ages and didn't work for 80% of our trip to HCMC. The movies are on not on demand either, so you have to wait for the loop to finish before watching from the start. There are also only about 7 old release movies to chose from. Strangely everyone was forced to shut the window shades and turn off their lights so that people could sleep... but it was only 11am in the morning and with a 3 hour time difference it just didn't make any sense. <br><br>The plane was understaffed and the attendants were therefore hardly attentive. Much of the same on our return flight to Sydney except that our inflight entertainment didn't work at all. When we asked if we could move to a seat where it was working we were told 'no'. The food was very average and don't bother with the wine or sparkling because they were undrinkable.<br><br>We chose Vietnam Airlines because they are the only carrier to fly direct. If I had to make the choice again, I'd stop over in Singapore and go with an actual premium airline... not one that pretends to be."
901,pcw2013,5,"FANTASTIC, we have flown with this airline prior with excellent flights but on the A350 we had half the noise of the old Boeing 777's &amp; the flat bed seats give such privacy. I now don't mind the middle seats as you can see through them from the centre when you lift your head above your cubical. Congratulations to Vietnam Airlines for the best &amp; cheapest Business Class seats with 4 star service &amp; thanks to helloworld.com.au for their excellent service also."
901,WamboinJon,2,"Holiday for family and attraction was direct flights and a reasonable (but not really cheap) price. <br><br>The Boeing 777 aircraft are tired - the external paint job in the photo is symbolic ....inside the seats are ageing, some with broken storage pockets and general tattiness. Entertainment system shows some western and Vietnamese movies playing simultaneously on different channels - no on demand services. My daughter's screen froze half way into flight and stayed like that....<br><br>Food was fair and offered Asian and western options but nothing to recommend. <br><br>Biggest surprise was service or lack thereof. For a country which does service at home so well it was a surprise to find crew who frankly looked and acted bored and clearly didn't want to interact with passengers.<br><br>Plus side is they left on time and in that sense reliable. That's about it though !"
901,Tawin201,5,The flight was very smooth even short haul but the cabin crew served with hot meal including alcohol the food also was very tasty. Comparing the price between low cost airline almost the same and you better service.
902,HughSutherland,5,"I flew with Vietnam airlines Singapore to heat grow after the recommendation of a friend. I made the booking directly on their website and was delighted to get business class for around 2800 sgd, about one third what SQ were asking. Short flight to HCM then a 787 to Heathrow. The layout of business class was fine... I think 18 or 20 seats fully flat bed. Surprisingly good movie selection and food was ok.... Not to SQ standards but quite acceptable. Polite if slightly wooden staff... Prob getting used to the idea themselves. I believe there is also a exec economy available. Only downside is long layover in HCM both going and returning... 4-5 hours which is a drag. Lounge in HCM ok for short stay but not the best. Suggest going with another vendor or split the trip with overnight or two in HCM"
902,Chrisandteri2014,3,"Nothing outstanding about this trip, same as all my flights with Vietnam Airlines LATE arriving and late leaving.<br>Food a bit better than average."
902,Kevin M,4,"Long haul business class on VA is well worthwhile. Excellent service at check-in, on board and while the lounge at Ho Chi Minh isn't the greatest (but better than Qantas in Australia), it is quiet, and comfortable. Superb choices of food. Flat bed makes for easy sleeping. Highly recommended."
902,colonistin,5,"Flew premium economy for the first time on this long haul flight to Hanoi and was not disappointed. The seats were wider, pitch was greater and the food tastier than in economy. The stewardesses were very attentive. Entertainment was probably the same as in economy with a wide selection of international blockbusters to while away the time. The flight to the East was in a Dreamliner which was more comfortable than the Airbus A350 on the way back as they had squeezed an extra 2 seats into each row. All in it was worthwhile to pay a bit more for so much more comfort."
902,Dayle-12345,1,"Don't even know where to start, the flight from London to Ho Chi Minh was dreadful the staff were rude, my screen broke for about an hour and when I asked a flight attendant why, he snapped at me, had to ask him twice before he finally went up to the front of the aircraft to reset it. Food was awful, my first meal was supposed to be a Thai chicken curry but by the time they had gotten to me they had run out so I was given a pot noodle (watery as hell), by the time breakfast rolled around I was assured after voicing my discontent after the dinner fiasco that I would be given first pick of the food! But no, they left me till last again so all they had left was a mushroom omelette and I hate mushrooms, but was offered another disgusting pot noodle snack, so all I would have eaten would have been two pot noodles in 13 hours, but I refused the rancid thing. This was my first time flying on the 787 Dreamliner which I had heard was a comfortable aircraft (unless it is configured to have the absolute maximum amount of seats like Vietnam Airlines seemed to think was a good idea) great news for their pockets, bad news for my back. Also my seat re-tractor button was broken as was my in flight entertainment screen. In all honesty apart from the plane not crashing as we landed they could not have made the experience anymore miserable. Worst airline I have ever flown with I will happily in the future pay an extra couple of hundred pounds in order to avoid this pitiful excuse of an airline. <br><br>PS on the return flight which did not fair any better, as we were getting ready to exit the aircraft in Heathrow someone said ""hey look shes picking her nose"" and low and behold upon turning around there sat a Female VA flight attendant with her finger right up her hooter! Lovely.<br><br>AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ALL COSTS, IF RYANAIR FLEW TO VIETNAM I WOULD RATHER GO WITH THEM."
903,World_of_JT,3,"Overall the service was OK, the food was good, but the choice of beverage was limited and friendliness/warmth of the steward/ess needs to improve."
903,Peter S,1,"In the last five weeks I have had 7 flights with Vietnam Airlines.  Domestic flights are usually short and are okay, a bottle of water and a hand wipe.<br>The quality of international flights is sub-par.  The planes are old and many passenger comforts don't work. Both my wife and I did not have an entertainment system that worked. The reading light and attendant button didn't work. Staff had a don't care attitude.<br>Our Siem Reap to Ho Chi Minh flight was late and then the plane had to circled Ho Chi Minh airport for over 30mins.  Consequently we were late for a connection to Sydney.  Our luggage didn't arrive with us in Sydney.  I hope it arrives at our home tomorrow."
903,Dag-Eriksen,2,"We are arrived 3 of us to Ho Chi Minh City international airport the 11th of July and had a connecting flight from the domestic airport which is only 5 min walking. When we arrived the airport we got information that our flight was 3 hours delayed, but no reason for the delay :)<br>Well since we had a business tickets we checked in and went to the lounge for just kill some hours, but it is was hard to find space for 3 persons :(<br><br>After had waited 3 hours we went to the gate for boarding and at the gate it was some many fustrated persons since it we more delay but no information and even we asked the ground staff they did not give us any explanation for the delay and when we asked the answer was just maybe maybe that....and so on.<br><br>We finally get onboard after 4 hours waiting :(<br><br>TO the management of the Vietnam Airlines with the responsible for the domestic market, please ask for help form ariports which know how to run a airport."
903,Unterwegs,3,"Received email the day before the flight with new flight times. Then the flight was late almost two hours. No explanation, no excuse."
903,saarahdayspa,4,Vietnam airlines was one of the better flight I took in a long time. Flights left on time and the service is immaculate. Though the flight attendants can smile more than showing robot style. Overall I will use them again.
904,Remy M,4,"We travelled with Vietnam Airlines to and from Vietnam, and are very happy with the experience, expect one thing - the quality of the food on our way home from Ho Chi Minh City to London. This is the only negative thing. Both dinner and breakfast was not good at all. The breakfast was, for some reason, too cold - impossible to use the butter as just one example, and even though I had ""cold plate"" wasn't this a proper meal.<br><br>The flight(s) was one time, the entertainment-system works, you can charge your phone, clean toilets and good information and care from the staff overall."
904,Erika C,2,"Our gate was moved, without notice, 4 times. The flight was delayed two hours for no clear reason. Boarding was chaos. There is no organized boarding--it is a free for all."
904,Thom V,4,"Firstly I booked the fill journey on reservation code however a few days before flying a schedule change was made, meaning I would be flying from SGN at 16.00 instead of 19.00.<br><br>Sadly Vietnamese Airlines didn't bother to change my first flight which was due to leave at 15:50... luckily I noticed the issue and contacted them to fix it which meant missing half a day of work as I had to leave 4 hours earlier...<br><br>Flight from PQC &gt; SGN was fine, on time and full of local tourists so the usual noisy ride. From SGN &gt; PNH there were a couple of issues:<br><br>1) Business class/loyalty card holders were allowed to board a bus first before the standard class, however they drove to the plane at the same time, and opened the doors at the same time, so those 'priority' guests were then swarmed as everyone ran to get on the plane. <br><br>2) AC not working on the plane = lots of crying babies<br><br>Flight was smooth, service as usual, VNA are still better than any budget airline in the region but some small things would be easy to fix. TO VNA benefit they allocated seats well based on my lotus miles preferences."
904,HanDurren,1,"I am a veteran of budget airlines in both Asia and Europe but Vietnam Airlines manages to reach down and find the bottom of the barrel (even though it purports to be a full service operation). What really lets it down is the antiquated booking and management systems. Expect to wait up to two hours to get a boarding pass. I could be wrong but it looked like they were using a paper system to check passages off a list which may explain why it is so slow. You could try web check in but the system appears to be supported by AOL circa 1995 (we couldn't get it to work). The ground operations are in general disarray with staff at gates and check in desks having little, if any idea what is going on. In fact, the arrival of aircraft seems to come as a complete surprise to them. There are plenty of staff around in the airport but they are all just chatting to each other or airport retail workers. They don't know what is going on anyway so no real harm done. <br>There is no continuity between flights so any connections within Vietnam will require you to fetch luggage, change terminal and then stand in another check in line (yep, expect up to 2 hours again). You WILL find yourself separated from the rest of your travelling group and sitting in a middle seat after your connection. <br>Of the 4 flights we took, all were delayed. In flight service is what you would expect from a budget carrier. Same goes for seats (no power / entertainment system). On the upside, the fleet does appear to quite new which inspires some confidence. <br>The budget operators servicing Vietnam seem to have their act together (we have used them into Vietnam previously) and appear to be slightly cheaper. If you can afford the extra $100 ish, stick to one of the major carriers such as Singapore."
904,Flybuys,3,"2nd time we have flown to Paris business class and this time it was such a bag of good and bad. 1st leg Sydney to HCMC great with new aircraft, Lay over in HCMC we were taken to a hotel for a six hour stay, horrible hotel in the middle of a business district so no shopping in walking distance, however service at airport very good with transit visa and transport to and from hotel. This service offered to business class passengers.<br>2nd leg HCMC to Paris older plane,so seat reline less that the 777-200. Food and beverages OK, both flights on time.<br>Return trip a nightmare. Had a code share with Air France, checked flight schedule in morning, all OK, arrived at CDG , Air France on strike and flight canceled. Air France could not have cared one bit about us, told us to come back on Monday (it was Sat morning), it wasn't their problem !!<br>2 hrs later a representative from VAirlines turned up and got us on a flight to Hanoi, then HCMC for our return flight to Sydney. Again an older plane, arrived in Hanoi, had to get a transit visa, 40 minutes till next flight !!<br>HCMC met again and taken to a hotel, 10 hour layover, much better than first hotel but only food provided. A city tour was included but we declined as have been to HCMC on holidays. Better to stay in business class lounge where at least you can get   beverages. Flight HCMC to Sydney perhaps the oldest plane in fleet. Night flight but little sleep due to poor quality of seats. The stewards are always friendly and accommodating, but I wont fly again unless I know the flights are on the 777-200."
905,BBC,4,"We had a morning departure to Saigon, Ho Chi Minh city early morning. The flight is on time and comfortable. The meal is just average as we all know that we cannot expect much from the airline, with a very reasonable price tag."
905,JHNB1,4,Although a short flight from HCM to DN choose the aircraft to get the best experience when travelling in Business Class. In our experience the 777 business seats are the best and the in flight food and service is well worth the additional fee.
905,Thomas H,5,"A domestic flight from Da Nang to Hanoi.  Flight was ontime, comfortable flight, no food,  bottled water.  Would recommend."
905,GlobalAdventure67,1,"Safety has to be a concern when an airline is run as badly as this. <br><br>. No working seat back video<br>. Food same as economy - Melb office confirmed this and Flight Centre had no idea that this is the norm<br>. Crew have very poor English - scared to think what could happen in an accident <br>. Seats uncomfortable <br>. Food inedible. <br><br>When seat back video didn't work I was offered compensation - big issue as what crew offered and what is policy is different. Melbourne sales office managed very very badly, only to be out down by management team in Sydney. Repeatedly asked to speak to country manager which should be an issue given how small the team was but either a) he couldn't bother or b) there is no one in charge. Either way - dreadful. <br><br>Flight Centre were just as useless in this resolution process. <br><br>Food on board is inedible. Suggest you pack food if you need to eat on board. <br><br>Would never recommend this airline. Much safer to fly to Singapore and connect."
905,M O,3,"Hanoi to Frankfurt on the B787 Dreamliner in Business. First time with this airline, chosen for better price.<br>Plane was late one hour out of Hanoi, as seems to be customary for VA as far as I can see.<br>1:2:1 configuration which I love, b/o privacy and don't have to climb over fellow passenger to get to aisle.<br>Food disappointing, bland, nothing wrong with Pho/noodle soup, but really, in Business?<br>Many screaming toddlers, not VA's fault I guess, but for 2000 bucks you kind of hope to get some sleep in your business class seat.<br>Entertainment system with small selection of new movies or TV series, I chose to play Bejeweled instead.<br>No in-flight Wifi.<br><br>Overall a disappointing experience I would have to say. Somewhat dreading the return leg."
906,requedieu,3,"My expectations were of a bare bones airline with little comfort or amenities. To my surprise, this airline is REALLY trying to deliver a basic, competent product. The checking-in process was professional and efficient. The cabin service was reasonable with hot food and ample liquids being served. Whilst the loos [toilets] could have been cleaner, they were in far better condition than most of the Chinese airlines I have flown. <br><br>I will fly with this airline again. They are trying!!"
906,sydonie w,1,"You get what you pay for. A modern plane which was lucky but staff were rude, service was dismal and food was terrible. Bring your own food and headphones on board and try to not interact with staff."
906,Tho Truong N,4,"Caring staff at the airport, good service on board, nice meal. New International terminal, suprisingly nice, clean and very convinience"
906,kavimani k,4,"Flew from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam Airlines. the flights in economy class were pleasant, and the flight assistants offered efficient but mostly smiling service. The aircraft are showing their age, but the cabins were clean and the seats were comfortable with plenty of legroom.A tasty meal was offered on the flight, All in all good value for the money."
906,bollen57,4,Having work in aviation/airlines for most of my life flying with Vietnam Airlines was above or equal to some of the more established airlines. The service and food were excellent.
907,Celine L,5,Great as is very cheap for full board.  However one male staff we met was very rude to passengers!  Other than that all are good. I think they need more training.  The male attendant definitely failed the service line.  Food wise ok so so.  We paid only sgd400 so I do not expect much.  Transits few hours so consider ok.
907,jaybeeFL,3,"Both legs of this flight were delayed. Aircraft was fine and flight attendants very personable and attentive. Food was OK, nothing to write home about! Major issues was lack of on time performance and poor communication with respect to when expect arrival/departure."
907,IxChel3300,5,"We took a total of four short-haul flights, all within VN.  Three were in business class and one was in coach.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about on any of our flights.  They all left on time and the service was excellent.  For traveling within VN, there is no better choice."
907,Concorde1414,3,"I can't quite put my finger on the myriad of things that make this an odd airline.  For starters the Vietnam Airlines lounge looked oddly retro unintentionally and the selection available suggests a throw back to communism.  The inflight magazine tells you that air turbulence can cause death......not what you ideally want to read, 6 miles above the earth! And nothing is quite polished about the whole experience.  I'd suggest they need some western management to show the way and perhaps translate more appropriately the dangers associated with turbulence.....Fasten your seat belt whilst seated comes to mind. But hey I guess impending death works too! <br><br>Food Service in Business was adequate but not decadent - and the staff were polite but once again not quite what you'd refer to as slick.  <br><br>For some strange reason I didn't quite feel assured .......I wondered if the maintenance staff where of the same ilk and therefore pondered their safety record. Garuda Airlines in the past always gave me the same feeling!  <br><br>All that being said there is nothing wrong with the airline or its service....it's more a sensation you have............."
907,TigerSimba,5,"I flew Vietnam Airlines from Hanoi to Bangkok via flight no VN613 and flew back from Bangkok to Hanoi via flight no VN614. I had a great experience. Right from the very start my flying experience via Vietnam Airlines was a wonderful experience. The lady at the check in counter to checked my ticked and luggage was very kind and the services was very professional. In the flight the staff were very polite and kind. The food was also very good, going to Bangkok I got Fish, Coming back to Hanoi I got Chicken. When the flight took off, I did not even feel it, it was smooth, when the flight landed I did not know it was also very pleasant. The flight crew kept us updated every step of the way. I was very impressed, surely will be flying Vietnam Airlines more often."
908,SusanNystrom,4,"Was a bit sceptical about using this airline however the flights were terrific, the level of comfort particularly from Ho Chi Minh City to Paris was exceptional and the transit service was a nice touch."
908,bazzty,4,"After I booked my flight I read some reviews of Vietnam airlines and most were very negative and I feared the worst. Was expecting some kind of 'Ryan air during the noughties decade only long haul experience..<br>However I was extremely surprised, airplane was modern, had good entertainment on board, food was more than passable, drinks were complimentary.<br>The drinks trolley was wheeled out very often but as long as you called an attendant or went to their little area at the back they would give you whatever you required drinks or snacks. So<br>Reviews had said that the staff onboard were unfriendly, I found them very down to business and without the painted on smiles which is all you need right?<br><br>I would fly with them again"
908,Rebecca R,4,Good flight. The only issue was it was delayed but the team did a good job of the turnaround. <br>In flight meal was very tasty
908,Alghofaili,5,"This is my 4th times fly with Vietnam Airlines..  Ground Staff are very nice,  inflight service was very good...  I really like to fly with them"
908,Lapidus,5,I have flown Vietnam Airlines a lot over the years and had some very ordinary flights. The quality of the experiences has varied so much that I would not have recommended them to anyone.  <br>Perhaps something has changed because the return flights to Shanghai were among the best I have had in recent times. The planes were new - 350 Airbus - clean and with really helpful staff and great service. Seats were lie flat and comfortable. The meals were really good too.  No complaints and I am looking forward to flying Vietnam Airlines again
909,RugbyMadKiwi,5,"When we got to Danang airport the staff at check in said our plane was running an hour late which was going to make our connection tight , however they said they would let Ho Chi Minh know and they would assist us at the other end. It turned out to be one and a half hours late leaving Danang so the connection was going to be very tight, then when we got to Ho Chi Minh, the pilot circled for 10 mins so we landed at 2.50 and our connection was departing at 3.15, so we thought it is impossible to make our connection. We got off the plane and there was a sign with our names on it and two people to greet us, they lady said you don't have time to wait for your checked in bags they will arrive on a later flight, which was scary after all the clothes and shoes we had made in Hoi An. They other attendant grabbed our hand luggage, and said run, we went outside in the 38 degree heat and ran to International where they had our boarding passes all ready, they checked the passports, then the attendant took us through the V.I.P security and then took us to the gate running every step of the way. As soon as we were on the door's closed and the plane started taxing, but very very impressive with Vietnam Airlines help that we could get from Domestic to sitting on an International plane and taking off all within 20 minutes !  They offered us a glass of Champagne as we were taxing out, which was a very nice touch. Also our bags reached our hotel later that night in Kuala Lumpur :)"
909,jfleetstreet,3,"We used Vietnam Airlines on our tour of Vietnam and Cambodia.  We had 2 long haul and 5 internal flights on the trip. <br>  We barely saw a single smile or greeting in our 30 hours or so in the air.  The cabin staff and the ground staff were very distant from their clients,with the feeling of just going through the motions of customer service.<br> In flight food was poor and the entertainment pretty average for a long haul flight on a luxury brand new plane.<br> On the plus side we were on time on all flight legs.  <br>  If only they looked as though passengers were not quite so much of an inconvenience it could almost have been an airline to recommend!!"
909,Canadian-in-Blighty,4,"I've travelled long, medium and short haul in VN. While some of the short haul flights have been horribly delayed I have always been positively impressed with the efficiency and service of the airline.<br><br>There are a multitude of carrier options for most VN flights but I would preferentially choose VN over almost any other.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the VN fleet is very new with excellent aircraft and often European or American flight crew and typically Vietnamese cabin crew. <br><br>I love he food on VN: it is delicious Vietnamese fare that tastes like food rather than the cardboard you can receive. <br><br>A negative is the inability to select seats at time of booking unless you book online."
909,Annamaria370,3,"The airline is good for the price you pay. I got a good price to Ho Chi Minh city. <br>Good points;<br>No delays<br>Food was good<br>Get a free pillow, blanket and headphones <br><br>Bad points;<br>Staff were not very attentive or friendly - called for them a few times and took at least 20 minutes for them to come over <br>They weren't very friendly - felt as though they were a bit rushed <br>Entertainment for a long haul flight was pretty poor<br>Queuing for check in in Ho Chi Minh - we were waiting nearly an hour to check in our luggage"
909,rover257,4,"Used Vietnam Airlines for flight from Phu Quoc to HCMC and on to Singapore. Very happy with service - comfortable plane, reasonable seat spacing/leg room, got meal on longer leg of journey, flights more or less on time. Would use again no problem."
910,Christine B,4,"We travelled to Ho Chi Minh via Vietnam Airlines. Very happy with the service. Each seat had it's own tv screen with a wide selection of movies, music and games which kept us all entertained making the flight go quite quickly. The stuff served drinks including alcoholic ones for free and the food was typical airline food, but quite good -asian influenced. Leg space a little tight for taller people but overall quite comfortable."
910,jeanesa,4,"Flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City and then on Domestic Flights to Hanoi, Hue, Ho Chi Minh and then on Flight 773 back to Sydney as part of a tour.<br>Yes the aircraft a Boeing 777 200ER was a little tired, but spotlessly clean in all respects and very quiet.<br>The in flight service was very good with polite and attentive cabin crew. The food was better than we expected and quite generous. No problems with drinks with plenty of options available.<br>Would not hesitate to fly with Vietnam Airlines in the future."
910,wlado d,2,Vietnam airlines offers good price deals. I have took return flight from Saigon to Nha Trang only 40 min flights. Both ways there were delays. I mean three hours delays on my way back was too much to digest. It really annoyed me. They are very unreliable !!
910,tukhaihang,3,"Average flight in Vietnam.<br>Experienced some delay.<br>Check-in staff in Tan Son Nhat was not really friendly.<br>But check-in staff in Da Nang was good and friendly.<br>Although with delay, is staff was good, it can ease some stress from customers."
910,Gearsnspokes,3,"Took this short flight from Saigon to Nha trang airport. The air conditioning was not working properly and the cabin temperature at ground level quickly soared to about 35 Celsius. Coupled with a delayed take off it was overwhelming and thought my wife might pass out. Apologies came only after about 20 minutes where the pilot said ""our gAuges show 35 in the cabin but almost 40 in the flight deck@.  Think that was a roundabout way of saying "" if you think you have it bad....""<br><br>Only bottled water offered. Not even a small snack."
911,filsaf,5,"First time using Vietnam airlines, I excited to be served with flight attendants using Ao Dai style clothes. I used to look it at pictures, but not in live display. The meals is typical Vietnamese food, but tasty. The flight was on schedule. I didn't really focus on in flight entertainment, but it was good."
911,pinoytraveller2,4,"I have flown with Vietnam Airlines since 2008, and every time I visit this country I always book flights directly on their website. If I can recall, some of my previous flights with this carrier include Hanoi to Da Nang, Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh City, Hue to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi to Siem Reap, and Phnom Penh to Hanoi. All the staff are courteous and efficient. I have no complaints, only compliments!"
911,berlinsider,5,"We booked a Aeroflot-Vietnamairlines ticket for our journey to Hué. Arriving in the early morning in Hanoi we were informed by a staffmember of Vietnam Airlines, that Aeroflot has booked us by mistake a connecting flight from the previous winter schedule which is now in the current summer schedule departing 10 hours later (!) at 18:00.<br>As a immediate gesture of goodwill they offered us a dayroom in the airport hotel, which we refused, because we did not want to spend a full day waiting for the evening. As an alternative they immediately agreed on my request of a free car shuttle into town and back which would enable us to dayvisit Hanoi and therefore not loosing a full holiday.<br>Even though the ticket mistake was not caused by Vietnam Airline they were extremely understanding, service minded and accomodating to us. We can highly recommend flying with them.<br>If the shift manager from April 10 2016 in the morning ever reads that, I am passing again my thanks to him!"
911,Huyscout,5,"I flew from Sài Gòn to Đà Nẵng a few month ago and it was, indeed, a great fly experience, the cabin crew were very polite. And the most important thing was our flight wasn't delayed at all."
911,goafishing,5,Only flew with Vietnam airlines once but found it to be a pleasant experience. All staff were pleasant and helpful and comfort was fine for the relatively short flight.<br>Would definitely use again if travelling in the area.
912,Kawahiro O,3,All cabin to be advised to improve their language ability in order to deliver better services to the foreigners. No doubt this airline is offering an excellent deal all year long and software part still need to strengthen.
912,CanisHan,4,"Ho Chi Minh, Danang, Kuala Rumpur, Siem Reap. <br>I have get this airlines the most except Korea's airlines. Sometimes the seat was inconvenient to me, but alll was no problem. Good facility for its price, I think."

912,Maowc,4,"For the price I paid, Vietnam airlines brought me and my family a better-than expected services. <br><br>We travelled with a child (7 years old) and the staff often provide us priority check-in when they see my niece. We really appreciated their service minds.<br><br>Food were quite good. Nice services and entertainment on board. Seats were quite comfortable. Web check-in is highly recommended!"
912,Philipho8,1,"The flight from SGN to Frankfurt was OK on a new Boeing 787. <br><br>The return flight from Moscow to SGN was a shocker. I received more than 6 change of itinerary moving my flights date to several dates other than the one I booked originally. Finally someone wrote to me that 'daily' flights were cancelled. I had to choose a Tuesday or Saturday flight. With visa restriction, I had to choose an earlier date cutting short my Moscow adventure by 2 days.  Unless I receive compensation it will be a long long time before I fly Vietnam Airlines ever again."
913,Sharonannd,4,"The  process from checkin to arrival was smooth and stress free. The space between seats was generous, the inflight staff were efficient and pleasant."
913,Paul M,5,"Friendly crew, nice and clean plane, accurate on time, enough information was given, no entertainment due to the short flight. It was cheap, it was good. Will fly them again"
913,counterpoint,3,"Business Class was fairly full on this flight from Sydney which took about 8.5 hours.<br>The plane was old and the interior decor tired (there were still signs of the ashtrays in the toilets) - the business class seats were, frankly, sub-standard and the foot rest mechanism didn't work properly so it was impossible to really recline my seat and elevate my feet at the same time.<br>This said, the service was friendly and the standard of the food good.  <br><br>New aircraft urgently required on this important route for the airline I reckon"
913,Aiyaphol K,5,"The check in was done by TG, which was ok. The lounge in BKK was awful, and the lounge in Hanoi was ok. The seats were acceptable but I certainly liked the 787-9 seats. The flight was overcrowded, some 200 passengers had to board an earlier A321 flight. At least I booked early and got the 787! Oh and, the catering from Hanoi is awful."
913,Richard L,4,"Three of us had booked last minute (5days before) flights direct to Ho Chi Minh City and the price was incredible. We flew on one of their brand new dreamliners and there is something really cool about flying on a all blue aeroplane! The aircraft was absolutely spotless and very comfortable. In flight entertainment was very good and sufficient enough, plenty of choices to keep you busy for the 12 hour flight. Luckily for me on the way there it was rather empty and was able to obtain a row of three seats and have a large amount of sleep. No problem with the food at all, was pretty much spot on.<br><br>The flight back wasn't as good. There was a lot of turbulence, granted thats not the airline fault. But the food wasn't anywhere near as good of standard as the first one.<br><br>The only real negative was the fact the control for the inflight entertainment was in the middle of the arm rest. Which I lost count at the amount of times we had either turned each others film off, called a member off cabin crew or turned the reading light on! But hey it was all in name of fun."
914,Bey79,4,"I managed to snag a very cheap return ticket KUL - CDG this month. The plane from Hanoi to Paris is new (A350). Legroom is ok, I have no complaint except the food..well airline food, what do you expect? T"
914,TonyK1959,4,It was the first and won't be the last time I fly with Vietnam Airlines. The flight time was short and even with a delay I was kept up to date knowing the waiting times. The staff were all very friendly.
914,Michael N,4,"Seats on the Boeing 777-200 (Sydney to Saigon) Business Class do not fully lie flat, however they are still very comfortable. Cabin crew were efficient and attentive without being obsequious. The food and drinks on offer were also of a high standard.<br>In Economy Class on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner (Saigon to London) seating is much more cramped with 3,3,3 configuration. If you can get 3 seats to yourself, as many did on our flight, then a lay down is possible. Service is much more akin to what one would expect in 'Cattle Class' with food to suit, but quite acceptable. The cabin crew were efficient and courteous. If you can afford the price Business Class is the way to go."
914,SalandBrad,3,"We recently flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh and bought an upgrade to Business Class for the experience as it was a reasonable price for the upgrade. The access to the lounge at Sydney was good, but not the Qantas lounge as we were advised by our travel agent and also given written confirmation of this. The flight was good, got us there as scheduled. The interior is now dated, no pod style seats, and the entertainment systems did not work so we had to be provided with tablets to watch a very limited selection of movies etc. The food was ok and the staff were also ok, but not what we thought it would be like.  Our decision to fly with Vietnam Airlines was purely based on the fact they are the only airline flying direct to Ho Chi Minh from Sydney. For the money we wouldn't bother paying for Business Class again. We returned to Sydney in Premium Economy and it was much the same. The seats were very dated, one entertainment system did not work and the food was very plain."
914,Skydive622,5,Vietnam airline is considered as world class airlines with good service no delay and staffs are very accommodating including ground staffs.
915,Patrick S,4,"First time on a Vietnam Airlines domestic service and was well impressed with its delivery. I booked an online domestic months back and I think I got a good deal. For a domestic two hour flight, I felt as though it was an international one. <br><br>The food on board was delicious, a good size and it came with beverages. It also offered full amenities like a blanket. 20kg baggage was also included in my fare. Comparing this to other normal domestic routes, I was well impressed. <br><br>Would definitely be taking this airline again for my internal travels within Vietnam."
915,Skydive622,5,Excellent trip enjoy the unlimited snacks at business lounge. Inflight service is also very good and serve good lunch.
915,Mad,4,This service is no frills and we flew several times with them while on a tour around Indochina. <br>Some of the flights offered food and some didn't but all seemed to be on time.
915,lismer602,1,"I am writing to warn people flying with Vietnam Airlines. This is our experience when we boarded a flight from Taipei to Hanoi on January 18, 2016, Flight number VN579, leaving Taipei at 7.30AM. Our seats were 12E and 12G on that flight. During the flight, I had a need to go to the toilet, while I left my handbag under the seat in front of me. My husband, sitting next to me was sleeping at the time. By the time the plane was about to land, I picked up my handbag and found out that both our passports were missing. I usually keep both in my handbag when we travel. We looked everywhere in the handbag but couldn't find our passports. In a desperate attempt, I asked the lady next to me if she happened to see something that made our passports disappear. She seemed to not to understand English and asked her male friend across the aisle to answer. They were sitting in 12C and 12D I guess. Instead of getting mad, she opened her handbag showing that there are no additional passports in her bag. I guess she wanted to show that she didn't have them. So we were really panicky and start looking around when my husband asked a male steward who sat 2 rows behind us during landing, but had then stood up directing people to exit. My husband told him that our passports were missing. His reply was somewhat funny when he said: Are you sure you didn't lose them in Taipei? To which my reply was: We couldn't have boarded the plane if they were lost in Taipei. So, this male steward started looking under our seats and cushions and we saw that there were no Passports to be seen. We started to walk to the exit door thinking horrible problems awaiting us with no passports and losing our deposit even before starting our tour. Suddenly, this male steward shouted to us, I found it, holding our passports in the air. And yes, those were our passports. We were so relieved that we grabbed them and walked right away, forgetting to check his name or even thanking him. I guess, if we had walked out of the plane and found out later, we would have lost our passports. We were also lucky when this happened before all the passengers got out. One thing for sure is that I never took those passports out of my handbag."
915,martin-nsw,3,"My tour of Vietnam left me feeling that all Vietnamese are gentle, beautiful, patient people who always have a smile. Except on their airline. 4 flights in total and I didn't see one flight attendant smile (until we were leaving the plane). Doesn't matter if you are western or Asian, everyone is treated with the same disdain. If everything else was OK then I would probably not review, but sadly no. Food was very average, in fact some was pretty much inedible (breakfast omelette). And forget about sleeping on the overnight flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney. The cabin temperature see-sawed from about 18 to what felt like a very tropical 26 or 27 degrees making it impossible to settle into sleep."
916,Josephchia,4,"Good value, business class fare. Service rated approaching 4 stars. For the same fare, you could either fly premium econ with a more established airline or business on Vietnam air. Plane :787."
916,Hugo A,1,"A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY<br>I just flew from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City on a Boeing 777. This was my first trip to Vietnam. At check-in, I decided to pay AU$1750 to upgrade to business class. In hindsight, I regret the decision as it was a complete waste of money. The aircraft was old and business class was absolute crap. I should say though that the staff were pleasant enough and helpful. My advice is to forget ""business class"" with Vietnamese Airlines."
916,Donna M,4,We arrived at the airport only to find out that our flight had changed till late in the afternoon. apparently an email had been sent to the company we booked through not to us.  However they were great they got us on another flight with Jetstar.  They helped us as much as they could.  Very happy with the service
916,iwattus,5,Very comfortable trip  with vietnam airlines......  staff very good very smooth flight.. english speaking crew very important to me
916,Thom V,4,"I find the long haul product from Vietnam Airlines is better than their short haul flight.<br><br>I was lucky on this flight to have three seats to myself which always helps with a long flight as you can really get your head down.<br><br>The food was of a good standard, service was friendly and polite, always offering more drinks etc.<br><br>Only downfall is the awful in flight entertainment system, last year they had whole series of TV shows to keep you occupied, now it's one off documentaries of, a very low standard."
917,davidruben,3,"Please dont book business class as its worthless. Seats are tight, no legroom. Suggest you fly Dragon Air or Cathay"
917,Robert D,2,"We had booked business class seats months earlier but when we tried to check in we were told out seats had been ""cancelled"".After some discussion we were directed to the ticket office where we were told our e-ticket was not actually an e-ticket.At this point a third person arrived and magically our seats were available.On board,it became clear what was going on when about 10 VIPs got on after keeping the plane waiting for an extra 10 mins.They took up most of business class but a couple of them trudged sullenly down to Economy;presumably they had attempted to bump us.In Ho Chi Minh the whole plane had to wait again while they were met by limos at the foot of the steps."
917,Robert499,5,"I Fly Vietnam Internal ,Frequently ,and Rate Vietnam Airline the Best for Comfort and Leg Room is Awesome and I`am not a Short Guy, On Board Food is  Very Tasty ,Equal to any other Airline I find All The Staff From Pilots to Cabin Crew  do there Very Best ,To Help All Passengers ,I Recommend All my Friend`s to Fly with Vietnam Airline ,If They flew From Perth ,West Australia to Vietnam I would Book With Them Regardless or Price Difference`s ,Keep Up the Great Work Vietnam Airlines"
917,Barry139,4,"..the upside of unexpected travel..?    <br><br>Murphy's Law upset my travel plans so I had to return to Hanoi, and Vietnam Airlines were not only the cheapest, but also provided an excellent service.   Without asking...<br><br>A seasoned traveller, I (try to) preplan as much as I can to reduce stress and worry.     But being upgraded to business class without asking..?    New to me!<br><br>And despite the short flight; no sooner at cruising altitude than we were descending, the (free) cool drinks were welcome, and a very perfunctory unloading had me (very) quickly where I wanted to be: Home!    <br><br>Top marks to Vietnam Airlines, particularly in providing an effortless and pleasant service helped in no small way by well-trained staff who made the trip a good experience.<br><br>No downside.   Ok, it is offseason, and there were only a few people on board.   Took off earlier than posted (few travellers?) and landed early too.  (No weight penalty?)   lol<br><br>Even so, worth recommending.   I will be back..."
917,DMClay49,2,"Vietnam Airlines (VA) think nothing of cancelling flights and disrupting travel plans.<br>Our daughter and her family live in Ho Chi Minh City, so we make regular trips to visit.  Last year my husband and I flew with Emirates, with no problems, but decided to use VA this year as they offer direct flights and we needed to get there quickly for the birth of their second child.  We even joined their frequent flyer programme, Lotus Miles.<br>On 31 December 2015 we booked our flights, to depart on Monday, 28 March, and return on Monday, 11 April.  This kept us within the 15 days for which a visa is not necessary.<br>On 13 January we were informed that VA had cancelled the return flight on 11 April and we would now have to return on 13 April.  This meant we had to apply for visas, at a cost of £116.  VA would not compensate us for this.<br>On 8 March, about 3 weeks before flying, we were informed that the outward flight on Monday 28 March had been cancelled and we were offered Thursday 31 March!  This was unacceptable to us as we needed to get there in order to help with the family at the time of the birth.<br>After several anxious days and telephone calls, we were offered a flight to Hanoi on Tuesday 29th March, with a three hour wait, on 30th March, for a connection to Ho Chi Minh City, which we had to accept.  So much for a direct flight! This meant that we did not need the visas, for which we had already paid.<br>Another incident that we found very confusing was the booking of extra baggage.  Although we were allowed a generous baggage allowance of 30k each, we needed to take a baby’s pushchair, enclosed in its custom made zipped bag.  This weighed 18k and cost £96.80 as prepaid extra baggage.  On arrival at Heathrow Airport we were informed that we needn’t have paid for this as all three pieces of luggage added up to less than 60k.  We had not been told that we could take a third large bag within our weight limit.  Although the check-in staff were very sympathetic, no refund could be offered.<br>Before all this disruption we had already booked our next flight with VA for August 2016.  We are now  concerned that repetitions will occur, to disrupt our plans yet again.<br>One positive comment is that we flew back in Premium Economy seating which we would highly recommend for a long flight.  We now wish we had booked it for our August flights , but find that it is much more expensive  to upgrade than if we had booked it in the first place!"
918,TDo88,3,"This airliner always charges unbelievably high prices while their services are quite poor. Many flight attendants only smile when talking to Western passenger. On Saigon-Hanoi route, it is very often that they will offer you a box of awful cold hard sandwich."
918,pLORAkeph,5,"I did not expect that Vietnam airlines has such a great service. The air crew very helpful. My favorite is the food. I am not a fan of airplane foods, but this one is pretty delicious. Over all, I do like this airline and yes, if you are lucky, you get very good deal with high class flight."
918,Kartina A,2,"I would like to feedback on our experience with Skidoo and Vietnam Airlines. When on-board VN 650 Seat 24A was not given any meal. And on-board VN651 Seat 32D &amp; 32E was not given any meal also. <br>Crew informed us that Halal meal for that seat not in the list and did not received any meal request. <br><br>Please kindly explain as all ticket booked comes with meal and we requested for Halal meal.<br><br>Clearly we have emailed you to remind the airlines. We are very disappointed as being on an early morning flight, breakfast meal is very important and due to the shortage of food on board the 2 passengers had to hold their hunger which led to gastric pain.  <br><br>We appreciate if you could give us an explanation to this poor service experience.<br><br>Regards<br>Kartina"
918,Thom V,3,"Both the departure and arrival were early which was great however I was deeply concerned with the landing preparations. When the pilot announced that we would be landing shortly there was no preparation by the flight crew which meant that nobody had their seats up right, the window blinds were not open, people still had drinks out all as we came in to land..."
918,Shana,5,"Use your credit card corporated with Vietcombank, ang you should register for Lotus Member. It's worth money maying when booking tickets."
919,Satu H,3,"Frindly crew. We were lucky as we two had 3 seats, so I could sleep half lying on the 2 seats. Food OK airplane food. No problems on the flight, watching movies too."
919,Sandra M,5,"We couldn't believe how cheap the flights were so decided to fly  from Singaopore return in business with stays at Hanoi,HoiAn &amp; HoChiMinh.<br>All flights were comfortable, the service was friendly &amp; the food was fabulously fresh &amp; tasty."
919,Melanie S,4,"Plane was delayed by 40 minutes, but presently surprised when we boarded the A321, it was very well presented and for a short duration flight this was all we needed.  No in flight entertainment offered and shared screens so wouldn't want to use this plane for any longer duration.  No issues retrieving luggage etc"
919,f_ain90,3,"The travel to Seoul from Hanoi was delayed for 30 minutes or so but we still arrived at Korea at the same time. Crew members were polite and attentive and provided prompt service. The seat is not the best which I have been in but it was definitely worth the price. There were ample legroom and the seats do not look old as they seemed to have maintained them pretty well. The personal flight entertainment screen was down, so, they offered us an I-pad instead. It wasn't too bad, honestly. The only down side of the on-board service is that the Halal meal was tasteless. I saw other meals and everybody else's looks fine but not the meal which I have pre-ordered. On my flight back from Seoul, I couldn't finish my meal because it was pretty bad. They offer the meal not long after departure which works fine with those who actually do not fall asleep right away and would prefer to eat early and be left alone throughout the flight. The landing was also quite smooth and wasn't too jerky even after it has landed on the ground. Although their stewardess might not have the best English pronunciation, it was not too hard for me to understand."
919,Zhing M,3,"Not a bad airline.  Even though the cabin crew is not smiling when rendering their services, but decent, warm and rather tasty meal  (not like some other airlines served hard-to-bite food) for lunch was served even though it was economy class. The aircraft used to fly from KL to HCM City (an Airbus 321) was a bit old and loud, but it was a safe journey after all.  Checking in at the airport counter was no fuss and baggage claim was without problem."
920,Chris1950822,3,Overall for a standard economy seat we were satisfied with the service we received but for a longer flight leg room would have been an issue.  The plane was clean and the cabin crew helpful so that made our flight ok.
920,lukebyrne1712,4,"Flew an internal business flight. Our plane and departure time where changed a few hours from departure so i thought i was going on the new 787 so was fuming about that. Upon checking in i went to the lounge, they had a good layout but mainly cold food and soups but plenty of them. the decor was old and dated, ripped carpet and chipped paint didn't give me a feel of quality. When i boarded i received champagne and a hot towel. After departure i found the seat controls didn't work so i couldn't recline back. I was served a two open sandwiches and fruit for my meal and orange juice, tasty but was expecting more. If flying with them again i would just go economy as theres little or no point paying the fare unless it a A330 or better"
920,Tucky_tk,4,"This is second time That I fly with Vietnam Airlines to Frankfurt.Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City (Transit) and Ho Chi Minh City To Frankfurt they used new aircraft Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new aircraft was new, seat wide,personnel TV, and other facility. I enjoy meal on board !"
920,YurgenW,1,"To say - disgusting means to remain silent. <br>The flight of this airline I remember a long time!<br>In order:<br>There was a broken seat, which fixed only in two positions. Seats are narrow, the distance to the front seats is very small.<br>There was no water in the toilet.<br>The whole flight infront of me was a blind spot of monitor light. The entertainment system was broken! <br>Disgusting service. Cabin crew involved only passengers speaking Vietnamese.<br>The plane was late for 6 hours!<br>The plane filled with drunken passengers, which no one makes remarks. Many people smoke in the toilets. Passengers changed seats as they want. <br>Next to me sat drunken Russians, who stretched his legs in torn and dirty socks.<br>There is only ONE advantage - low price!"
920,Matthew S,4,"Vietnam Airlines is a basic but good airline, better than any of the budget airlines but not up there with a Emirates or Qatar Airways. I have flown with them many times on this route and never had a bad experience in Economy or Business Class and they always feed you something which is a rareity these days. Note there is also a bit more room that the budget airlines."
921,Outtowna 2,3,"check in was easy. We departed on time.  Seat very uncomfortable, had to sit on blanket something sticking in my back.  Meals were awful and I am not a fussy eater.  My hubby asked for a different meal and is still waiting... Got us home safely and on time... Would only travel on this airline if had no other choice. In flight entertainment did not work at all."
921,Teenz V,5,"The service was good, there were not movies but i wasn't expecting it on a two hour flight. The food was great I enjoyed it immensely. <br>Overall the airline experience from one place in vietnam to another was great however I would prefer other airlines when travelling overseas."
921,Julie R,1,"During the flight I was not feeling well and needed to lie down due to stomach cramps. My husband got up to enable me to do this and asked the flight attendants for help with finding a seat as he had noticed several available. The attendants refused to help and he was standing up for over two hours.<br><br>Why was there no help given to seek a seat for my husband under these circumstances? <br>It transpired that at least a dozen Vietnamese nationals had been given complete rows of three seats (in order to sleep throughout the flight). We even saw several family members split up in order to have a row of three each, just sitting up for meals. We could not understand why others were squashed into rows of three when there could have been more thought about giving EVERYONE a bit more space not just a chosen few. <br>This had also been the case on the flight out mainly in the middle rows and could not just be a coincidence. (I doubt if individuals had paid for three seats).<br><br>Also our friends who were seated toward the front of the plane had problems with children talking all night therefore having no sleep whatsoever. They then discovered that they were in fact unsupervised as their mother was in asleep in first class! How was this allowed and why did no attendant intervene?<br><br>This was one of the worst long haul flights we have ever had with appalling customer service."
921,Richard A,1,"I travelled premium economy to Ho Chi Mihn and found the service terrible. We were given a meal as soon as we were airborne and a drink and a cup af tea all at once and that was the last time we were offered any refreshment. On the return flight one of the staff sat behind me and went to sleep for a few hours while the others sat in their own seats. Apart from a lovely plane it was the worst airline i have travelled with. Most of the films were chinese or Vietnamese, poor"
921,joelle d,3,"It's not the same level of comfort as the more expensive airlinesbut it's less than half the price (4000 AUD) return airfare Sydney-Paris-Sydney via Ho ChiMinh City) in business class, so it's a great bargain. The staff is kind and helpful, the food okaand depending on which flight you are, the seats can be old-style lean back or in pods for the newer planes. The transit in HCMC varies between 6 to 15 hours so you get a hotel room either for the day or the night, depending on the flight, and a city tour. Somebody waits for you at the airport and rushes you through visa control etc...and you are driven toand back the hotel. Sometimesyou get a great hotel, sometimes a crummy one. The second half of the flight (HCMC-Paris) was operated by Air France with great food and wines. It's the second time we do it thisway and we'll do it again!"
922,Tony A,1,"Baggage check-in, immigration, and security are a disaster at SGN airport.  You need the full 3 hours to get through, even then, you might miss your flight.  Only 1 person working baggage check-in for Vietnam Airlines economy for all flights.  Terrible. Immigration lines will be well over a thousand people deep and nobody will help you if your flight is leaving soon.  Avoid this airline and airport if at all possible.  Simply not worth it."
922,cutia,4,"I've been a customer of Vietnam Airlines for 6 years now and generally choose them over other low-cost carriers because most times the prices are just as good. However, the service they offer is generally much better than a low-cost airline, plus you get checked-in luggage and decent meals. I do think that this is the best option when flying in and out of Vietnam, not only because prices are good, but because of their schedules too. I'd rather fly in the afternoon with Vietnam Airlines than having to wake up at 6am to get an AirAsia flight."
922,Robert A,4,"Vietnam is a long narrow country with poor road or rail options, so everybody flies. Vietnam Airlines provides a good budget price service from town to town as well as international flights. We flew economy seats in a reasonably new aircraft piloted by an Australian. It was smooth efficient and timely. A freind made the same journey the same day  by Jetstar and was delayed 4 hours. The airline unfortunately is impacted by the inefficiencies of a large airport in transporting large numbers of people on and off planes.<br>The flying experience is fine. The airports are another story"
922,Teddybiers,4,"This is a value airline, cost from Bangkok to Tokyo is very cheap compare to Full services airline. However, the price itself is cheap likes AirAsia X. Service is quite good food is good enough for me."
922,BlueCraig,5,For local flights - we found Vietnam airlines excellent. Even on short flights we were served with towels and a snack of good quality. Service was great and the planes were excellent.<br>Strongly recommended.
923,tristan v,4,There are multiple flights flying this route with the same airline within the same hour.  Flights were being cancelled delayed and gates changed on this specific day.  Please be alert.<br><br>We arrived so late in Ho Chi Minh City from the afternoon flight  that we missed our evening show that started 3h after the flight was supposed to land.  <br><br>However the exit rows are roomy in economy and the flights are cheap.
923,tristan v,4,"Check-in was easy to locate and effortless, the airport easy to navigate and staff spoke excellent English.  Seats in Economy are a bit wider than that of other airlines.  So do give Vietnam Airlines a try if you are flying internally in Vietnam.   We bought tickets in the exit rows so had ample leg room"
923,MateoHongKong,1,"From the off this was a basic flight with poor service. Customer service is very poor, information and flight times are constantly and regularly changed. Vietnam Airline staff are dismissive and unhelpful. Connections between International and Domestic Vietnam airline flights are regularly missed due to delays and airport staff incompetence. Baggage delays were problematic and a cause of missing a connection. Under these circumstances Vietnam Airlines staff are unhelpful and completely dismissive. If you expect reasonable service, flights to not be cancelled and no delays please avoid this airline."
923,Nguyen A,5,"i travel with my family and have a good service from staff, enjoy the meal on flight. have a good trip."
923,cagfire,5,"We flew with Vietnam airlines for the first time and found it to be a very classy service in business class. <br><br>The flight to Vietnam was on an old plane, with no lay flat seats, but that was OK as we expected it. The seats were comfortable, had good recline and were suitable for the 8 hour trip from Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh. <br><br>The food was delicious and the wine and drinks selection classy. <br><br>We felt well attended to and the flight attendants were attentive without being hovering. <br><br>We had a domestic connection between Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi before continuing on to London. The business lounge at Hanoi was comfortable, but the food was a bit dubious when it came to meat being out. There was enough of a selection to not go hungry, and the staff were accommodating and pleasant. It was better than sitting at the gate for several hours. <br><br>The flight to London was on their new 787 Boeing planes with lay flat beds. Very nice!<br><br>Gotta say, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable flight and the bed configuration was actually very comfortable. They have huge private tv screens for each cubicle and the movie selection was quite adequate, if not huge. <br><br>Each seat has usb charging and the 787 to London has uk charging port. <br><br>We aren't frequent business class fliers, so for us anything above cattle class is a bonus. But we appreciate quality and customer service, and Vietnam airlines showed it was up to the mark in these areas. <br><br>It was little things like waking up mid flight to find new water bottles, having an attendant approach you after waking with a small snack, being aware of their environment and you. It was nice. <br><br>Is this an airline trying to be something it's not? No, but it is good value for money and you'll be comfortable. It isn't Etihad or Qatar or Qantas, but it doesn't have to be. <br><br>I'd fly with them again in a heartbeat and loved our flights with them enormously. <br><br>Well done on providing us with a consistent high level service."
924,Nick S,2,"After booking two full econonmy seats in January, we arrived at the HMC 2.5 hours before flight was due to depart and told that we would not be sitting together for the 9 hour flight, in fact we were 16 rows apart. Check in supervisor was particualry unhelpful and told us it was our fault for not checking in online.<br>When we got on board we found quite a few couples seperated like us and my wife who was sitting next to a father seprated from his family by 10 rows. The two ladies sitting next to me were seprated from their husbands even after they thought they had booked centre row of four seats together."
924,Matilda,5,"I had a great experience travelling from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh which I felt I had to share. It started off with me missing my flight. Vietnam Airlines normally contacts every passenger on updated information regarding changes in Departing Time for their flights. Unfortunately since I had booked my flight through a travel organisation, which failed to forward my contact information, the information about changes in flight Departure Time, never reached me. That's why I arrived to the airport about when the flight took off.<br>Panicked as I was I reached the Vietnam Airlines help and booking desk at Phu Quoc International Airport. Here I was informed about the situation and immediately the staff started looking at solutions. He gave me the opportunity of two different flights, one which was fully booked already (the early one) but he asked me to sit down and wait to see if anyone failed to arrive in time to this flight. This flight ended up still being fully booked and as soon as the Vietnam Airlines staff realized this, he continued helping me a family who also had missed their flight to get onto the second one. <br>As I had a connection flight from Ho Chi Minh, the staff also made sure to send an e-mail to make sure I got assistance at Ho Chi Minh for my connection flight. <br><br>During this whole time being in contact with Vietnam Airlines I received excellent service and helpfullness which I was so grateful for. I imagine if I had booked with another airline from Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh they would have been likely to just say ""too bad"" for missing my flight.<br><br>The flight was on time and I got well taken care of after arriving in Ho Chi Minh City.<br><br>Last but not least, I have to tell you, I did not have to pay an extra dollar for the new flight..!"
924,Thanvimon M,4,large seat and comfortable for long flight.flight attendant is polite and friendly  to answer.clean restroom and hope to flight with again.
924,ajfharnett,3,"These are old planes i.e. 777-200. The seats do not recline more than 90 degrees, making it difficult to sleep. The configuration is an unfriendly 2-3-2. I was in seat 2D. Fortunately the middle seat was empty. Food was much, much better than on the outbound flight. Actually it was very good, as was the French St Emilion wine.<br> The plane was late boarding in Sydney and then we sat at the gate for another hour, due to air traffic control. I believe there was some kind of industrial action by the airport staff??? So I missed my connecting flight to Bangkok, and had to wait 90 minutes sitting in the corridor while they put me on the next flight, which was operated by Thai Airways, and then another 2.5 hours before departure. They had to wait for someone from Thai Airways to show up to authorise the reissued boarding pass.<br> All three flights on this trip on Vietnam Airlines were late."
924,Thom V,4,"Be aware, as the route is only 45 minutes maximum and usually takes off early in the morning you could believe you will get to Phu Quoc early morning, however this route now often changes to an evening flight (must be when they don't have enough passengers) which can leave you stuck in Can Tho."
925,Thom V,3,"What a waste paying more for business class when the lounge is serving the cheapest of products with the most unappetising look.... boiled eggs and rice soup. This is a key business route and should be at international standards, Not local."
925,tanngay43,5,"attentive service, warm, safe, very punctual, everything will be perfect, from now Vietnam Airlines will be the No. 1 airline flights every time I pick"
925,Cody M,3,Staff was the best part.  Landing was a bit rough though. The food was not very good at all. The plane could be cleaner
925,heshnosaff,1,"To put this in perspective, I fly A LOT; all over the world, with a variety of airlines, in all classes of service. I am hard pressed to remember a worse experience. To make a long story short, I wanted to fly with my family within Vietnam and this airline had a decent flight schedule and I figured it would be better than flying with some of the low cost airlines.<br>My first frustration was with their website--after entering all the tedious details for 4 people (passports #'s, DOB, etc etc), it repeatedly threw me out with obscure error messages at the very last stage. Being a persistent person and really wanting this particular flight, I ended up wasting a good 3 hours or so until somehow the system accepted my reservation. To my distress, apparently this time I somehow clicked the wrong date--it was one day before I wanted to fly. I quickly called the airline and was told it was my problem--no attempt whatsoever to help or even be nice. When I asked for a supervisor the service rep simply hung up. This happened repeatedly. <br>After a while I decided to give up and spent another couple of hours trying to buy tickets for the correct date. <br>After this long ordeal I was hoping that the rest would be ok. Alas, one day before the flight I received a cryptic email saying that my flight had been rescheduled for 4 hours later than originally planned. This was really bad for me as I had people waiting to meet me. I tried calling the airline and had a series of frustrating conversations. Among the nuggets -- I was first told that the flight was rescheduled due to fog (how does one know it will be foggy 24 hours ahead of time??), when I insisted on asking they said that the flight was actually leaving as planned but some passengers were moved to a later flight (?!?!). When I pushed further they invited me to take a taxi to downtown Hanoi to speak with them if I wanted to change this.<br>There were many other frustrating aspects (the representative at the airport was extremely rude to many of the passengers, the boarding was handled very poorly, etc), but by now you probably get the drift. <br>I strongly advise to avoid this horrible airline."
925,Corrine,3,"This was the first time I took Vietnam air. I was pleasantly surprised the amount of leg room I had compared to the other airlines that I had previously travelled with . Baggage claim were pretty efficient , not much delay .  However, flight crew seemed to be aloof and can come across rude at times . The guy beside me politely asked for a cup of water , the stewardess replied ""Later!!"" .we both looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. End day , the guy never got his cup of water."
926,GGGClub,4,"Very nice and quiet new aircraft.<br>Well trained staff for an on board service, very courteous and efficient.<br>Good food and drinks served on board.<br>A nice experience indeed."
926,Candy C,5,"We booked flight from CanTho back to Hanoi after tour in Mekong Delta, this is firs time   we take flight in Can Tho, it is not crowed and we dont need to spend much time to check in. The staff are friendly and alway smile. Highly recommend to take flight in Can Tho if you travel in Mekong rathern than back to Saigon."
926,Kevin-Vance,3,"Quite an old airplane, all the in flight entertainment was broken, so nothing worked, food was good, coffee was great, we did a further 4 flights with this airline, where everything did work"
926,Michelle P,4,"This was just the first leg of our flight to India and a very short flight. Check in was not perfect as this was the only flight that we couldn't check in on line for and when we did check in at the airport, the machine broke and he said that we'd have to check in at Bangkok for the second leg. I was not happy and requested that he use another machine to check us in for the rest of the journey which he finally agreed to do, then he didn't realise that we were travelling business for the second leg and had to reprint the boarding passes after we pointed this out. The flight was fine and left on time."
926,hcondon_12,4,Flew several internal flights within Vietnam with this Airline including a two-prop flight between Hoian &amp; Dalat and could not fault the flights.   All flights went smoothly and the cabin staff were friendly&amp; efficient.   The check-in was a bit confusing as sign-age was not as good as it should be but overall we had no complaints.
927,MOHSMD,3,"We got this airline since it provides most of the domestic flights in Vietnam. Let me say that both times we checked in, the staff was not friendly. They did not ask our seat preference and quite curt when answering questions. My 3 year old daughter was assigned a seat beside 2 strangers. The planes are big and comfortable though. The staff was not helpful when I told them we had a connecting flight to manila and had a very tight schedule. The bottom line is, ""we do not check through luggage to Manila"". This could be said with a better tone and our group of 12 could have been expedited through security. Alas, we were left on our own.We had to climb the stairs going up the plane on both times we did the roundtrip from Saigon to Ha Noi."
927,Bjoern,4,"New planes, with nice staff and OK food. Felt really safe traveling with this airline, I would fly with them again."
927,Ron W,3,"Whilst our flight to Ho Chi Minh City from Sydney was comfortable (given that we were seated in a bulkhead row) and the food and entertainment acceptable, on our return flight, we were packed into a Sardine Tin, the Entertainment System wasn't working at all, and the food lacking in choice and wasn't pleasing to the eye. This airline, like many other Asian International Carriers, doesn't meet my standards in terms of International Carriage. Despite the cost differential, if I can afford it, I'll stick with Qantas. On a positive note, internal Vietnam Airline flights were of a much higher standard, seemingly, than their international flights; offering, it would appear, more ""wriggle space"" for us larger than life Australians."
927,John A,2,This flight had the worst service out the 150 or so times that I have flown. For no apparent reason the food trays were left in front of the passengers for 1 1/2 hours. That prevents movement and makes it easier for lazy stewards. There were only 3 toilets and the lineup was long. When I queried why one had been occupied for so long the steward jimmied the door and removed staff luggage so that it could be used for the intended purpose. It appeared that on this flight the staff were dedicated to minimizing their work.
927,sjbsteven,2,"The check in service was slow and not very friendly. The aircraft was an A321 which was a few years old. The aircraft was not so clean, loose toilet rolls in the toilets. The cabin crew were not friendly and the service average. You got a meal and a drink but nothing else after and main meal on a 3 hour flight to Jakarta. Take off and landing was comfortable. No greeting or farewell friendliness on boarding and leaving. Cost fairly expensive when compared with Jetstar Asia. Jetstar more friendly and better value for money. We travelled on both to and from Veitnam. Usually, I don't like to fly Jetstar but it was better than Veitnam Airlines."
928,Enjoydifference,1,"They just cancel our direct flight, told us to use THREE flights to get to the destination or go on different days with less than one week notice. It means that we already incur penalty or no refund or more expensive options left at the destination. We paid more for the direct flight and being offered to have three flights spending forever hours worrying about connections and loss of luggage. The law allow them do so, but if they are doing the worst to customers it means that they are at the same level as Ryanair. Never again I would book with this company. Travelling with them is very stressful as you constantly having to check whether they are really flying or not and they are known to just cancel flights, no effort on their side, they just cancel flights just like that! Very stressful and you do not feel like being on holiday. They should not be allowed operating."
928,pluckycanuck,3,"Check in was not a problem, and the service was basic, but then again it was a short flight, about an hour. We flew on a turboprop, I think an ATR 72. We got a bottled water but no food. No real concerns, it got us to where we needed to go on time."
928,Steve H,3,Delayed out of Hong Kong<br>Another delay landing in HCMC <br>Huge delay of three hours leaving HCMC causing me to miss my connecting flight in Melbourne <br>Too many delays but otherwise the airline is fine.
928,Paolina1980,4,"I was expecting something uncomfortable due to the asian standards, instead i experienced a pleasant flight, very good leg room (considering vietnamese people is not really tall), decent food and very kind cabin crew. Last but not least the flight arrival/departure was on time."
928,ajfharnett,2,"I looked at reviews before I booked, and saw that they were upgrading their fleet to include Airbus 350's and Boeing's 787, which I took to be a huge positive.<br> The flight from Saigon to Sydney was overnight and on a Boeing 777-200, of indeterminate age. Definitely rather old. The seat configuration as 2-3-2. I was in an aisle seat in the centre. The recline is is the region of 90 degrees. They issue tablets for entertainment. Movie selection is about 12 English titles. My first choice would not play so they gave me a replacement. Same problem. My second choice just stopped half way through, and even a restart did not solve the problem.<br> A French Bordeau, a St Emilion was excellent. Food was served in ceramic , otherwise it looked like coach food, i.e. all served on crunched together with rice in the middle separating the meat from the veg. Very disappointing. No sensitivity to content or presentation."
929,Margaret D,4,"We had 7 flights over a 3 week period with Vietnam Airlines and everything went very well - comfortable planes, even in economy, efficient service and punctual flights."
929,256jenl,4,We took Vietnam Airlin to Hanoi and were very happy with the quality of the food and service. The seats were petty decent as well.
929,Julie A,3,The staff were not helpful at all and everything seemed to be too much effort for them.  Wouldn't call them rude but came close.   Food was below average.  Movies old.  Best thing was that we requested exit rows and were given them on both flights o had extra leg room which was great because we are both tall.
929,Coby D,2,"We have travelled with this airline 5times,but this was the worst one.We've got used to delays on internal flights but our return trip to Melbourne was  delayed 3 times,instead of leaving at 20.50 it left at midnight. By the time we boarded the battery on my reading device had died,didn't worry too much ad I thought I'd recharge  the USB on the plane. No such luck,no USB socket on this plane,no chance of a movie either as none of the media screens were working. Staff were'nt at all helpfull.Terrible tea and coffee,both looked like dishwater. To add insult to injury we emailed family who were picking is up at Tullamarine to check the arrival time, as the plane was late leaviu.They checked at 8a.m. the arrival time said 9.30.When they got to Tullamarine the arrivals board still said 9.30.The board then constantly changed until the plane arrived at 12noon.Will Vietnam Airlines pay for the extra costs for parking their car?I think not!!!"
929,kay e,1,"This was the worst flight I have ever had in my life, just after take off it was announced that all audio / tv was not working for the trip, they had a movie playing in the middle of the isle with no sound.  The seat in front of me was torn and a big black box under the seat in front of me and no where to put my feet, the woman in out row wanted to change seats, so I kindly did and when I sat in that seat there was also a broken box under the front seat that also was uncomfortable for your feet, the smallest seats I have ever sat in, definately made for Vietnamese people only, the food was inedible, we had a supper and breakfast, disgusting and I have eaten a lot of plane food and it is usually not too bad. The hostesses were grumpy, the plane looked very very old and tired and needed to go to scrap, we were glad to get home safely, we had our fingers crossed I can tell you.  You also cannot book your seats on line, we tried to upgrade but couldn't"
930,Turki A,3,the lady in the counter was not understating as i have not booked a flight out from Ho chi minh because i was not sure how long i will be staying there. <br>the airplane is a little old but clean <br>service was good but my points was not added to my alfursan membership although both are members of skyteam.
930,Kacey M,3,I flew Vietnam Airlines on two occasions during my Southeast Asia trip--domestic from Hue to Hanoi and international from Hanoi to Luang Prabang. They got me from point A to point B without incident.<br><br>Their website could use some refreshment--had some annoying formatting issues when entering my phone number that resulted in me having to call customer service and eventually book over the phone for a slightly higher price.
930,Munyoz,3,"in general, all flights are the same.. I have taken in the past also for long hall Vietnamairline.. Food and sits are made as cheap as they can... Staff however polite and helpful."
930,Phuc_Phan,5,"Among Vietjet, Jetstar and Vietnam airlines, it's our country's best airline. Took off and landed on time (even few minutes sooner than expected) - which is the most important thing that the other two don't have, meal was okay but a bit cold, drink (tea or coffee) was good. I got tickets during their promotion, so with the price I'm really satisfied."
930,KatrinMHT,1,"Well, we have two major points. One was a shocking experience upon check in (see complete experience below) and second that even we have send several emails to customer care from Vietnam Airlines since 20.2 but after 15 days, still NOBODY has contacted us with a simple apology or even explanation. This is really below customer service and if we could we would have given this a 0 rating! <br><br>Dear Vietnam Airlines, <br>I have been considering for a long time if I should let you know about my unbelievable experience on our last trip beginning of January but even after almost a month I am still very upset at how we were treated. If I had sent you the email right away it would have been extremely rude so I’ll try to bring you all the facts. <br><br>My family and I had booked a trip via an Online Travel Agent from Hanoi to Phuket via Singapore. Our flight from Hanoi to Singapore was with Vietnam Airlines and from Singapore to Phuket with JetStar. Please see below for details: <br>Outbound: Sunday 17 January <br>	VN0663 08:05 – 12:25 Hanoi – Singapore <br>	3K0535 14:45 – 15:35 Singapore – Phuket <br>Inbound: Thursday 21 January <br>	3K0534 10:00 – 12:50 Phuket – Singapore <br>	VN0660 16:05 – 18:20 Singapore - Hanoi <br><br>When we arrived at Hanoi airport at 6 am to check in, the counter Staff advised us that she can not check our luggage through to Phuket. We asked why not and she said ‘because we booked with another Air Carrier from Singapore to Phuket’. We would need to get out of the terminal in Singapore, collect our luggage and then check our luggage back in. <br>This is very new to us, never explained before and we got slightly irritated. Especially when we have booked one itinerary from Hanoi to Phuket! When we explained that my husband can not get into Singapore since he would need a Visa (Indian passport holder), she just said that I would need to do it then since I have a German passport. This is certainly not acceptable, especially as she was not willing to consider we have an infant travelling with us - we asked to see the supervisor, hoping there is a better reason and solution provided – we were wrong. <br>The Supervisor came, looked at our booking and said there is nothing she can do since we booked a ‘CHEAP AIRLINE’ to continue the flight. Excuse me, but it is none of her business how we book our flights. This is our hard earned money which we are spending on us, who is she to judge what is cheap and what is not, for a supervisor this lady has NO SENSITIVITY at all. Both my husband and I are from the Service Industry (Hospitality) and this is the worst Customer Service we ever experienced. After going back and forth, explaining that we booked it all together, it has one confirmation number from the OTA, our luggage was not sent through. Amazingly after talking to us and leaving us with the counter staff, the supervisor went on her break! <br>All I want to know from Vietnam Airlines (a so called NOT cheap airline), did you really expect us to split up in Singapore, by husband and our baby staying in the airport while I go, collect our luggage and check it in? Seriously?<br>What is even more amazing is, once in Singapore, we went to JetStar customer service counter (decided to not go through immigration) and asked them if it is possible to have the luggage routed to Phuket without us having to check it back in and they did it for us straight away, no questions asked – I think I like the CHEAP airline better!<br>On our way back from Phuket airport, which is extremely small in case you don’t know, there was not even a question about our luggage. Immediately it was sent through directly to Hanoi. How come, they can do it but Vietnam Airlines or the ground staff at the Hanoi Noibai Airport can not?<br><br>Another issue happened when we were boarding. We advised several people that we needed our Stroller for our infant back in Singapore at the Gate (which is normal practice across the world) because we had 3 hours to wait till our next flight. Guess what? It was sent to the baggage claim. After talking to several people, at the check in counter, at the gate while boarding, with the cabin crew, they just ignore your request; say yes even though they don’t know what you are talking about. This was very very inconvenient and again, we are travelling rather frequently and never had issues before getting our stroller at the airplane after we landed. Again, very poor service from all the team members involved. <br>Our last incident was on our flight from Singapore back to Hanoi again in Vietnam Airlines on VN0660. The Flight was not full and we were lucky to get a row of 3 seats for our family. Unfortunately when we arrived on board, the seat cushion cover next to the Window seat was put upright and it had a huge blood stain on it from what can only be explained as from a Woman’s menstruation. We asked the stewardess immediately if she can change it. She said the flight is not full and see what she can do? We waited approximately 15min until we asked the next person. Again saying the flight is not full and they should be able to assist us. We mentioned then that we don’t want to change the seats, we just want them to replace the seat cushion. As you can imagine it was hard for us to keep our toddler away from it since he wanted to crawl all over the place and look outside the window.<br>It seems that the cleaning personal in Singapore saw this and put the seat cushion in an upright position to highlight it to the next crew, probably highlighted it as well to the team. My question is, why was nothing done about it from the crew? What if your flight had been really full? Did you expect to have somebody sitting on it? It was revolting and disgusting and does not need to be shown on social media else we definitely would. <br>Having written this note, I am still very frustrated by just the lack of willingness and poor quality of service received from Vietnam Airlines. I do not wish to hear excuses but would appreciate if you can show some respect and answer the points/ questions I have raised. If you would need more information from me please feel free to contact me any time <br>I am more than willing to share this letter across as many channels as possible so as to warn other travels and advise them to start flying cheap airlines because paying a higher prices at Vietnam Airlines does not necessarily equate to higher quality of service.."
931,Hoàn T,2,"they cancelled my ticket without notifying me in any way, then basically held me hostage at the airport until I purchased a new ticket"
931,David T,2,I flew from Hanoi to Hochiminh City and then from there to Sydney so tow flights with the airline.<br>I have to say the 777 for the long flight was looking rather tired and certainly needed a tidy up thats for sure. Made for a very long flight.
931,Tuệ Minh N,3,"This airline was good. The airport was a little bit dirty and crowded, but I think the service was good. I like the food. Very delicious."
931,Richard E,2,"Very average service.  By the time they were half way through the meal service they only had fish left as an option.  This happened on both flights.  During the flight staff ignored service requests from passengers with many call buttons staying on for most of the flight.  If you wanted any additional drinks it was faster to go to the galley yourself and interrupt their social gathering.  The entertainment systems didn't work in many of the seats which is disappointing for a brand new plane, and again the staff weren't interested in fixing it or assisting passengers. During landing there was actually a child standing up on the seat behind me, there was no final safety check done.  Cheap flight, great new planes, but the staff need refreshing and motivating."
931,Fernando C,2,"The poorest meals I've ever had. <br>Staff asked us what kind of meal we'kll like to have, and once we choose, they gave us the wrong one.<br>Not very friendly staff and the poorest meal I've ever had"
932,Jon C,2,"Just be warned.Coming from Ho Chi Minh City REGARDLESS of what check in staff tell you, ensure you and travelling companion are seated NEXT to each other, not parallel across an aisle. Third time this has happened"
932,flyingdoc1,4,"One of the few airlines flying to Bangkok from Gatwick, apart from some Emirates flights.<br>Reasonable legroom and service.  Stopover in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). On time."
932,Makka10,3,"Probably the most disorganised airport I've ever seen in my travels.  Once you are talking to someone at a counter they are quick, friendly and efficient.  But you have to get through to the front of a queue, if that is what you call them in this case, first.<br><br>Firstly it's difficult to work out what bank of counters you need to go to for check in.  Once you work that out, you have to see where the queue starts.  Sometimes it's just a bunch of people standing there, further congesting the area.  3 lines could converge on a simple operator.  The person in front of you could bring out the 35 separate passports of his tour group and check them all in at once.  (This all happened to us).<br><br>The same lines at security, although around half way in you finally get to see those taped laneways appear, that makes it a little more organised.  It's only when you get through security, which is pretty fast once you are there, you realise the time factor taken is because the emigration line literally starts at the security entrance.<br>You need to allow 3 hours for this debacle prior to your check in time, no matter what airline you are with."
932,robynjhamilton,3,The trip across from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh was great... but the return trip was a nightmare... there was a staff shortage..  the dinner plates were left on the passengers tables for 3 hours ... most passengers took the used dinner plates back to the galley themselves...there were lots of babies on this overnight flight &amp; most of them screamed all night... don't fly at night ....shame that this was such a difficult return flight after a lovely holiday in Asia
932,Diane M,4,"I was fortunate enough to be able to use my ""miles"" to up grade to Business Class on my trip this week from Paris to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh)  .  I traveled on one of the new A 350's that were put in service in October 2015.  The Flat Bed experience is wonderful - I felt like I had a normal night's sleep - no jet lag.  Vietnam Airlines regularly has sales on their tickets - click ""I like"" on their Facebook page to be informed - it does bring the cost of the Business Class ticket down considerably if you can buy it during the sale periods."
934,meyagi81,2,"Would have been nice if the flight was on time. 4 hour delay going to Phu Quoc, and 2 hour delay coming back from Phu Quoc.  Nice airline, great service, but ontime service is what matters the most.  Sat in the Business section on the return flight.  Nice business lounge in Phu Quoc, unsure about the quality in the domestic terminal in HCMC, but walked in and it looked decent."
934,NickDavis,4,Good experience on their Dreamliner Aircraft direct flight to Hanoi (and subsequent return trip Hanoi to Heathrow in March). The airline was efficient and the seats in Economy were reasonably spacious. The food on both flights was a choice of Asian or Western.  I chose Asian both ways and was pleasantly surprised by quality + they give free drinks inc alcohol if required with your meal in all classes. The onboard staff were all very courteous and there entertainment centre touch screen was a good size. The only minor grip would be that on February flight out the choice of films was very poor with no decent recent items so had to watch a couple of old classics (1930's) coming back in March film choice was much improved (so marked average due to outward flight). The direct flights don't operate every day but unless you plan a couple of days stop over somewhere like Bangkok or Dubai (in which case the lower flight price this gives is negated by hotel costs) would recommend the direct flights that only Vietnam Airline provides.
934,Vathana,4,"Took an overnight flight. Blanket and pillow were ready on the seat, sealed in plastic bag.<br>Meal was acceptable.<br>Air hostesses were all smiling and helpful.<br>Served Coke, tea and coffee on board-free of charge.<br>Get the miles which could be redeemed with other carriers bearing the so-called ""Skyteam Alliance"".<br>Flight entertainment was only onscreen TV, which cannot be operated individually beside turning off. No USB port to charge phone."
934,K T C,3,"The airline used one of the new A350 and the overall experience with this aircraft was excellent. Air conditioning was spot on, ambient was nice, noise level was acceptable, food and drinks was great, and most importantly, the leg room was generous!<br>The big multimedia screen provides clear and sharp picture quality, and the movie collection was enough for such long haul.<br>The air stewards were slightly inexperience and without much smile whole flight long. I believe Vietnam Airlines need to quickly fix this in order to improve ranking."
934,Karl Friedrich H,4,"A new dreamliner with a good service and better from food in economy compared to other carriers. Arrived on time, also the return flighth from Honoi was on time. We had no issues with luggage, the allowance with 30 kg was very nice and better than average.<br><br>We had also two domestic flight which have been also very pleasant."
935,Chucks1960,5,"First time flying with them, pleasantly surprised, great service in flight, only positive comments re flight, even though luggage lost in transit at Singapore airport from another airline, made lost luggage claim at HCMC airport and luggage delivered to hotel in HCMC following day....... great experience!!"
935,Peter T,2,"We all gathered at the designated gate then at boarding time they announced that we would now board from another gate. Everyone then and lined up at the second gate for another 40 minutes. Everyone was pushing into the lineup, no organization whatsoever. Then following some mass confusion we were lead out onto the tarmac and all loaded onto buses and driven to the extreme far edge of the runway where we finally boarded the plane. Food on-board was substandard."
935,B.J. K,5,"We had multiple great flights on Vietnam air.  The seats were roomy and there was service appropriate for the length of the flight.  Our short flight had water served and we got a light meal on the longer flight.  Within Vietnam and the surrounding area, this is the way to travel."
935,Snips43,5,"Great budget airline who do what they say &amp; very cheaply priced. Had no issues with pre-booking as I did with another airline, paid once &amp; got everything you would expect from this kind of travel.<br><br>Thank you for your professional service."
935,Baliroz,5,Comfortable short flight. Water given on board. Departure on time and prompt check in<br>service. Seats reasonably comfortable. A good flight overall.
936,sleepybexhill,4,"Provided a good service and the A321 was quite new, so we felt safe. Legroom in Economy was fine. The crew were pleasant and helpful with a reasonable command of English, which was good on a flight within Indochina. Good value for money. Happy to travel with them again."
936,ken h,4,"Flew for the first time with Vietnam Air and was very impressed with service staff and quality.we took an optiontown upgrade which worked very well,notification of the upgrade arrived 3 days prior and all went smoothly.<br>We will definitely  use Vietnam Air again"
936,Warren W,5,"I do travel a lot with my work both locally and internationally normally flying with a local airline or there international equivalent so I was pleasantly surprised when we chose to fly to Siem Reap, Cambodia via Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam from Australia. <br><br>The aircraft was modern, well fitted out with a nice ambience and all the amenities that the bigger airlines have. The food was typically airline food but was really well prepared and fresh. But most of all the staff were just fantastic. So well presented and with constant smiles nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed the trip so much that we are going back this year and I have joined there Lotus Miles reward program as I don't think we will be flying with anyone else if Vietnam Airlines service the routes we are intending to travel to. The staff were all fantastic and an absolute credit to there business."
936,caroline m,5,"Great service,The staff were permantly walking up and down with soft drinks, We got bottles water. lovely food, Dreamliner so great legroom. I really enjoyed the movie choice.Nothing was too mich trouble."
936,Carol R,2,"The staff on this airline were very good and the food too, but the airline interior is very old and not much works.  It is also very noisy in the cabin.  My lap table was broken and they had to prop it us with a cushion.  A lot of the in flight entertainments didn't work and some seats wouldn't recline."
937,Scott T,1,"I've flown Vietnam Airlines in the past and have always experienced passable service. Nothing to rave or rage about. <br><br>However, this month, I experienced a few encounters with the Vietnam Airlines staff that I can only describe as disappointing, unprofessional, and absolutely unhelpful.<br><br>I booked my mother a Business class ticket from SGN - NRT to meet me in Tokyo for a weekend trip in Japan. The airline's policy is that if you are booking for someone else you either have to check-in with them or come to a branch to present your credit card. Unaware of this policy, I traveled to Kyoto (no Vietnam Airlines branch). <br><br>When I realized and contacted the Tokyo branch staff, I was told I could confirm over email. I responded with my information but no one responded with the correct confirmation papers for my mom to present at the airport (as I was told she would need them when she went to the airport). <br><br>I contacted the Helpdesk phone line and asked if they could check on the verification (since the Tokyo branch was closed and my mother's flight leaves at 6AM the next morning). The staff told me they didn't recognize the Tokyo branch's email and told me they couldn't help me since I had communicated with the Tokyo office and they are located in Saigon. No way to check in the system, no way to send a new verification form, nothing. <br><br>She went on to talk over me, say that it was my fault for not reading the policy, and that it was not their responsibility to remind me about the fine print. She asked me to navigate to Vietnam Airlines' website to read the policy for myself. Also suggested over and over that I go to the Tokyo branch and show them my credit card even though I was in Kyoto at the time of this call.<br><br>It took a very long, frustrating exchange to finally get her to look at the ticket number and check the system for us regarding the credit card verification. She ended the call reminding me that it was my duty to read the policy and not their responsibility to remind me or my mom.<br><br>This airline doesn't care about your business. Its policies are completely against modern technology. We will not be flying with Vietnam Airlines again."
937,Dick M,5,"Very friendly staff, excellent service and good on time performance.wish they allowed online checkin though."
937,Per R,4,"Boarding in airport went smooth and fast. Onboard we enjoyed travelling with the new airbus A350. Especially a tall guy like me enjoyed what seemed to be a little bit more spacey economy class than normal. Onboard entertainment was excellent, food and service just fine and we would use Vietnam Airlines again - which we did during our travelling in Vietnam."
937,EazyDPitfield,4,Nice new aircraft and very few delays compared with other national carriers when flying domestically.
937,yvr1,5,"Had to cancel a domestic flight with Vietnam Airlines for May 2106. I did this today in the morning, went on line, filled out a refund form, sent it to them, had a response in less than two hours, and later today another response telling me that the entire amount would be credited back to my bank within the next two weeks. I was surprised that a full credit was issued as this was the most inexpensive airfare available. All I can say is, that compared to most other airlines I would rate their customer service as A+. It was also nice that someone actually signed the email I received, not just a form letter. I had to fill in the ""when did you travel"" box on the review but of course I did not travel"
938,Life After Accounting,5,"How rare is it to-day to get a decent meal on a relatively short flight? Plus it was good. Someone said the reason the airline is so good is because it is owned by the government. That means they are more interested in attracting tourists than just running  a bare bones airline.<br>Service, by the way, was also outstanding in a warm and friendly way that only seems to consistently occur in Asia.<br>Although the airport in Hanoi was quite busy, especially for flights for this national airline, the lines movedd steadily and there were lots of check-in staff available to handle the crowd."
938,KentKritic,5,This plane is so new and comfortable - it even seems to have nicer air and nicer lighting . The service direct is such a bonus - both out to Hanoi and return from Ho Chi Minh City . The staff were great and the food very nice. Only four seats across.
938,ameraffandy,3,"Very clean and tidy aircraft, looked pretty new in fact. <br>Standard business class seat with recliner type seats.<br>Cabin crew efficient, friendly and welcoming. <br>Requested for Muslim Meal and the taste was not to my liking.<br>There was no AVOD, only shared screens dropped down from the overhead panel."
938,backpackmania,1,"The Korean manager refused to issue me my boarding pass because a couple of stamps in the several years past got smudged by water. This cost me a lot of money. I took him to court but the case was dropped due to lack of evidence and he made an issue with only the stamps. When something happenes like that, a temporary passport was available and he didn't help nor did he offer a standby ticket for next available flight. But he tried to sell me another new ticket at an inflated rate."
938,Nev Tickner,5,since 2009 I have taken this flight around 30 or more times ... there is no comparison to any other way to reach the historic Muang Thanh Valley in Dien Bien Province (bus or car) when you circle the famous valley above the historic battlefield of Dien Bien Phu ... you get a sense of the sacrifice that took place during the 5 month siege back in 1954 .... but at  the same time the beauty of the valley with its traditional villages of ethnic Thai people on whom the the French imposed themselves for the final showdown against forces of rag tag people's army of Ho Chi Minh..... a must see attraction for anyone wanting to experience the feel of history at this birthplace of the free and independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam
939,Stephane Hong Kong,2,"Good things: cheap and good leg room space<br>Bad things : Staff did not show any kind of interest in providing good service. They were actually quite rude (European standards) in the way they were asking for any thing.<br>We took another flight right after to go to Siem Reap and exactly the same service. It became a joke during our trip to Cambodia lol. Food was also poor.<br><br>I was going to fly back to Europe with Vietnam Airlines (it was cheap) this summer but after this experience, I have booked with another company and it cost me more but worth the extra pennies."
939,Laura M,5,We were very surprised at the space we had in Premium Economy.  We were given similar add ons  (such as slippers) as we have been given in a higher class on other airlines. The staff were very good and the meals were excellent.  We did fly with them twice more internally.  There is more leg room on these flights as well.  All of the planes seemed quite new.
939,xsltrvl,3,Not knowing what to expect we were pleasantly surprised. None of the efficiency of an Ait Asia but  decent experience.
939,Nev Tickner,5,had a smooth transition in Saigon before a comfortable flight to Sydney ..... excellent staff service during the trip ..... have used them quite often but never thought of reviewing them
939,Teegeekay,4,In comparison to the other local competitor (Vietjet) this flight was on time no hassle and a pleasure. The service was simple no fuss and almost to the minute accurate. <br>We didn't have to pay extra for luggage. Clean efficient friendly. <br>Vastly better than the Vietjet experience.
940,Jon T,4,Perfectly adequate. You only get a bottle of water but that is standard in this region. They have to be fairly brisk as the flight is short. It was punctual and quite acceptable.
940,gidzmmo,3,Both my flights HCMC-Hoi An left on time - I was expecting delays due to the Tet travel period so was pleasantly surprised. Airline crew were friendly and polite. The refreshments served were ordinary but it was a short flight so nothing to complain about. Airport lounge is basic but comfortable.
940,123soton,2,"Flew twice from kl to hcm and hcm to tokyo.  Airplanes very dated, minimal entertainment options. Overnight flight to tokyo was uncomfortable in old seats, entertainment system wouldn't play anything and kept resetting itself to home page and the bright white light that made sleep for my partner and I difficult, staff refused to move me and unable to fix the problem.  Lucky it wasn't a longer flight. Also refused to hang up my suit bag.<br>Food was tasty however and ran on time."
940,Roger5Uk,4,Brand new airbus A350 XWB. Business class seats surprisingly a bit narrow.flights on time and very smooth. Food good and staff very attentive.
940,gary13phnompenh,4,"Took four flights using VNA and all of them were either ""late"" or ""delayed"".  However, the airline is a good one with courteous cabin staff, and immaculate aircraft.  I flew business, so have no idea how economy was, however seats are sold out very quickly, so one usually has to plan pretty well in advance to get the fare one wants."
941,Charmaine,3,Overall the plane was clean and tidy.  However there is no entertainment on board apart from head phones.  Seats are not comfortable even for business class.  My seat had a broken foot extension and my partners tray was also broken.  On the way over the food was just ok.  On return somehow the food was fantastic and we were given a choose out of a menu.  Even a glass of Champagne and a glass of Red wine.
941,BradJill,3,"We used Vietnam Airline for a long weekend trip to Ho Chi Minh City late last year and found all aspects of our flight experience to be fine, no frills nor complaints. <br><br>Online booking directly with the airline went smoothly. A lot of email in Vietnamese wasn't helpful but also not difficult to convert to English so not really an issue either. Check-in at HKG and at SGN were both timely, flights departed and arrived on time. <br><br>Legroom was a bit limited, TV entertainment acceptable given the short flights, in-flight meals forgettable but not terrible.  We took carry on luggage only so can't comment on how quickly luggage was sent out. <br><br>Overall, not a preferred airline and I'm not sure if we'd choose them for long-distance flights over other regional carriers. However, for short flights into and out of Vietnam, I see no reason to not use Vietnam Airlines. For the price of the flights, all seemed fine and acceptable."
941,theresalwaysone,5,"We were on the new Dreamliner. The check in was seamless, staff friendly and helpful. On board there was lots of space, a nice pillow and blanket and the usual bits and pieces of slippers etc. Seats reclined well for sleep. Food was very good and drinks plentiful. Staff attentive but not obsequious. Inflight entertainment had good sound quality and reasonable choice."
941,sigerjet,4,"It was easy for me to have this flight that had two reasons.<br>one was place of departure at Haneda, other one was time of departure.<br>This carrier's hospitality was simple but enough on this price."
941,KarenP11290,3,"We used Vietnam Airlines for every flight because we didn't trust the other option - Malaysian airlines.  Vietnam airlines were more expensive than Malaysian.  We had flights to and from Sydney and all internal flights (4 domestic).<br><br>They got us to our destinations and I guess that is always a good thing.  The food was horrible and staff were not friendly at all.<br><br>Only had one real issue.  We booked all our flights about 10 months before we traveled.   When we got to the airport for our flight out of Da Nang, even though we got to the airport in time and while the check in desk was still open we were told that the flight was over booked and that our options were either to get a flight the next day or they could try to get us on another airline that night (it was already 9pm and we had a tour booked at 8am the next morning).  I refused these options and they got us onto our booked flight BUT why was the flight over booked in the first place and we had a valid ticket.  NO GOOD ENOUGH.  Will never use this airline again."
942,OrangeS11,4,I booked Vietnam Airlines for flying to Siem Reap (via Hanoi) and later again to Hanoi. They provide a A321 aircraft which was suitable for the short distances (less than 5 hours journey). Cabin crew was very attentive to all passengers' needs and one particular crew was great to assist me as I was drowned in a plane of China tourists. Placed an advanced order of MOML and was promptly and deliciously provided. I will definitely choose Vietnam Airlines for my SEA trips again! P.S. Maybe they can include skyshop for all flights?
942,RockyWeybridge,3,"After booking and paying in full for 6 persons for return flights from London Heathrow to Saigon we were informed that we could not book seats until 24 hours before flight scheduled departure.<br>24 hours before departure I went on line to book 6 adjacent seats for my group. Unfortunately this proved to be impossible as the system kept crashing. I telephoned Vietnam Airline to check if there was a problem with their system they said that there was no problem. I pointed out that I had made more than 6 attempts to make the seat reservations and that the system constantly crashed before completing. I was referred to the technical support. This did not help as their response was, that after checking, that there was nothing wrong with the system. No help or advice, crap Customer Care????<br>Eventually managed the booking using 2 computers with 2 operators.  ( a friend advised that some airline systems times out) pity Vietnam Airlines did not tell me??????<br><br>The actual flight was not a lot better<br>Considering the aircraft was a “Dreamliner” less than 12 months old the sound system for entertainment, watching films, videos, game etc was extremely poor. The selection of films left a lot to be desired (old films like “Casablanca@ were amongst the titles)<br>Drinks served on the flight were most probably the worst I have ever experienced. An hour into a 12 hour flight I asked for  a Gin &amp; Tonic,  only  to be told, that they had no Tonic Water.  I thought ok , I would have what my mother used to drink,   Gin &amp; Orange juice. This duly arrived and my wife asked for the same , only to be told that they had no more Gin.<br>An hour into our flight they had run out of both Gin and Tonic Water???????????<br>The return flight was not a lot better.  On the first round of drinks we did manage to get 2 t Gin &amp; Tonics, but the Gin was limited to a miniature between the 2 of us. When I asked if there was further gin available I was informed they had run out of Gin.  (only another 11 hours of flying before we get back to civilization).<br>We all enjoyed our stay on Vietnam and most probably will all return in the future.<br>However we all agreed that we will never fly with Vietnam Airlines again"
942,proyle,5,New 787 Dream liner. Excellent very comfortable lie flat seat/beds. Wonderful food and service. The only negative is the choice of recent films was a little limited. Journey time 12.5 hrs. Overall given the cost was very reasonable and it was a direct flight an excellent experience.
942,Orlando_Vaz_Neto,4,"I was not expecting to flight a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner when I was told we would be on Vietnam Airlines from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. It is a domestic flight but the traffic between the two most important cities in the country is huge. They have many flights a day and they use big airplanes. Everything was correct: check-in was easy and flight took off as scheduled, an honest meal was served. For a 2 hours flight, the crew was quite busy. This airline was pleasant surprise."
942,Julia N,1,"I'm very disappointed in Vietnam Airlines. They cancelled my ticket without notifying me in any way, then basically held me hostage at the airport until I purchased a new ticket. (The same one I had - just I had to pay twice as much since - hey - last minute!) I asked to speak to a manager, but they refused to let me do anything...and, again, it was basically pay or be trapped in a foreign country.<br><br>VERY disappointed and would not fly with them again under any circumstances."
943,Shaun M,2,Vietnam Airlines has had a special project over the past few years to lift its class rating. It will never get there until they get over the speed hump of serving guests ham or cheese sandwich slapped together in a hamburger bun and wrapped in glad wrap. Never ever been served anything different. My two year old could make a more complex sandwich.
943,dare2burbest,4,"Good afternoon,<br>I write this email as I have received outstanding customer service by Vietnam airlines in particular Ms  Hong Van and Ms Tam Thanh from the refund department.  My query was handled promptly and and efficiently.  Both staff members took the time to listen to my issue and also understand where I was coming from.  This isn’t always the case when contact airlines.  They were professional and also friendly and I felt valued as a customers.  I haven’t as yet flown with Vietnam Airlines my booking is in April, but if this interaction is anything to go by I would highly recommend them."
943,benron_77,5,"They sure included all the services of a full service carrier for such a short trip. Flight was only 1H 10M but they gave out freshening towels, reasonable food for economy class.<br><br>The English for announcements over the PA has lots of room  for improvement.<br><br>They are really trying to make an effort to match up to the renowned international carriers. Will be travelling on Business Class to Europe with them soon and really look forward to it.<br><br>Well done on this flight Vietnam Airlines!"
943,Phill T,4,"Until now, we have only used Vietnam airlines on internal flights, but heard that they had new planes in 2015 so decided to give them a try.  The plane was in top condition, clean and comfortable.  We paid to upgrade to Premium Economy and although there was no early check-in, the comfort and quality reflected the extra cost.  Meals were quite simple and the entertainment system worked well but the movie selection seemed very limited (same on out and in-bound flights).  However, for value for money we would recommend."
943,Nicole H,5,"Fantastic airline, great staff and seats that I could actually fit in ( I'm 201 cm). We travelled internally after flying via jetstar from Australia. Next time I will be taking Vietnam airlines for the whole trip."
944,VivaHawaii,4,Vietnam Airlines is actually much nicer than most people think.  The entire process from online booking to check-in to the actual flight experience is all easy.  The cabin crew are always very nice and the food is good.  I generally fly business class on VN simply because it's not that expensive.
944,John S,3,"Vietnam Airlines changed our flight time, but the ysent only one email to notify the change. Being in the remote Ha Long Bay, we didn't get the notification in time, therefore we missed our flight. However, they were kind enough to put us in a basic hotel with meal cards, The also paid for ground transportation. In flight service was less then an average. Crew wasn't courteous."
944,Linda W,5,"Our check-in was smooth and the flight was prompt. The cabin crew was courteous and friendly. Cabin was clean, and seats comfortable. Because the flight was only about 40min long, we got only water, no snacks. Definitely the best in the country. We carried on our luggages so I don't know about the luggage service."
944,holidaylover1414,5,"My experience with Vietnam Airlines was definitely a very positive one. Not only did we have 6 flights in economy class, we also got upgraded to business class for one of our flights through the trip. Definitely something i will never forget. Even in economy class, we were treated very well, getting 3 meals and drinks throughout the flight, we had a movie screen with an excellent variety and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this airline."
944,jipteq,5,I used this airline on two occasions I found the most outstanding thing is the price of this airline the economy is very tightly packed and seat pitch is less than useable but I am a big advocate of world travel and here you can do it very cheaply!<br>I always found the cabin crew polite and friendly and on all the flights service was very good.<br>Its true the long layover in Vietnam at first seemed bothersome but its a good place to explore I will even make it my final destination in the near future ... all one need consider is this is often thousands cheaper than all other airlines although I will use business class my next long haul flight
945,Steve M,5,"What made this flight stand apart from other airlines that I've flown to London is the cabin crew who were friendly and courteous.<br><br>The flight from Sydney to Saigon was on a 12 year old Boeing 777-200ER with the old business class seats, However for the 7 hour flight during the day it was fine.The food and wine service was excellent.<br><br>The layover in Saigon was 8 hours in a rather outdated/uncomfortable business class lounge. The airline needs to look at reducing this layover time or improve the facilities to entice frequent travellers which could include shower facilities and better food.<br><br>The Saigon to London flight was fantastic, on the new Dreamliner 787-900 which was only a few months old. The service was just a good as the previous leg and the 13 hour flight went quickly.  What an excellent product. If they had this aircraft  between Sydney and Saigon and reduced the layover to say 3-4 hours hours, it would be be perfect for the frequent Aussie business traveller to the UK. This would be excellent for those who do not want to go through the middle east so to avoid any chance of sexual discrimination for same sex couples.<br><br>Great product, great price that needs only a few minor changes to get a loyal following."
945,Vanmerino,3,"The things that keeps me flying Vietnam Airlines is that they have the youngest fleet of aircraft in Asia and they are pretty cheap. But you get what you pay for. The service is terrible.<br><br>I have never been on a VN flight that left on time and they never tell you anything about the reason for the delay or update you. On-board it is no better - the (so called) entertainment systems never work and if they do there are a very small number of movies.  <br><br>The staff on board generally do the absolute bare minimum and then skulk in the galley fort he whole flight playing games on their phones and eating noodles. if you want a drink they will get you one but it will take forever. Although the menu says there are sandwiches available throughout the flight, there simply aren't, its just noodles, not even any crisps or other snacks.<br><br>You need a good book or the ability to sleep on planes to fly the 8.5 hours from Sydney to Ho Chi Minh with Vietnma Airlines. I have noticed the internal flights have better aircraft, but the service is still rubbish and on our 2 hour flight from HCM to Hanoi there was no food or alcoholic drink service at all.<br><br>Also, they allow a ridiculous amount of cabin baggage, so loading takes forever and if you don't get to your seat early there will be no room for your bags.<br><br>Oh, one other thing, when you book you will get an email about upgrading to business class. its like a lottery, you pay an upgrade fee (a few hundred dollars) on the basis that you might get upgraded when you arrive at the airport. This absolutely does not happen (think about it, how many people can they upgrade even if business class is not sold out?) and then you don't get the fee refunded for weeks after your trip. Its a rort and basically a pyramid scheme. Do not fall for it!<br><br>They do have good planes and pilots though, which is probably the main thing."
